(4) failure by the Company to comply for 30 days after notice as provided below with any of its obligations under the covenants described under "Change of control" above or under the covenants described under "Certain covenants" above (in each case, other than (a) a failure to purchase notes which constitutes an Event of Default under clause (2) above, (b) a failure to comply with "Certain covenants--Merger and consolidation" which constitutes an Event of Default under clause (3) above or (c) a failure to comply with "Certain covenants--Reports to holders" which constitutes an Event of Default under clause (5) below);
(6) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company ora Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration provision");
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to  30 million or more;
(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions"); or
(8) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of  30 million (net of any amounts that a reputable and creditworthy insurance company has acknowledged liability for in writing), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the date on which the right to appeal has expired (the "judgment default provision").
However, a default under clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes notify the Company of the default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (7) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable
