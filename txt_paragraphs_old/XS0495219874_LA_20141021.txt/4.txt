For purposes of this make-whole redemption, "Applicable Premium" means, with respect to any note on the applicable redemption date, the greater of:
(2) the excess (to the extent positive) of:
(a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the principal amount of such note plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such note to and including March 15, 2020 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points, over
(b) the then-outstanding principal amount of such note.
For purposes of this make-whole redemption, "Bund Rate" means the yield-to-maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that have become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Company in good faith)) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to March 15, 2020; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to March 15, 2020 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to March 15, 2020 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
Optional tax redemption
The notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole but not in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture, at any time at a redemption price equal to the
90
principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption if, as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws or any regulations or ruling promulgated thereunder of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or Additional Taxing Jurisdiction or any change in the official application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, or any change in the official application or interpretation of, or any execution of or amendment to, any treaty or treaties affecting taxation to which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or Additional Taxing Jurisdiction is a party (a "Change in Tax Law"), which becomes effective (i) in the case of any Change in Tax Law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, on or after the date of the Indenture or (ii) in the case of any Change in Tax Law of any Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, on or after the date such jurisdiction becomes an Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the Company is or would be required on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date to pay additional amounts with respect to the notes as described under "Payment of additional amounts," and the payment of such additional amounts cannot be avoided by the use of any reasonable measures available to the Company, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company would be required to pay such additional amounts.
