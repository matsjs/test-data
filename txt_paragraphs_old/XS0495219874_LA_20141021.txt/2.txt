Payments on the notes; paying agent and registrar
We will pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes at the office or agency designated by the Company in London, England, except that we may, at our option, pay interest on the notes by check mailed to holders of the notes at their registered address as it appears in the Registrar's books. We have initially designated Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch to act as Principal Paying Agent and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as Luxembourg Paying Agent and Registrar for the notes. We may, however, change the Paying Agent or Registrar without prior notice to the holders of the notes, and the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. If notes are issued in definitive form, and for so long as the notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Company will appoint a Person located in Luxembourg and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee as an additional paying agent for the
89
notes and the Company will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent or Registrar in a leading newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
We will pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, notes in global form registered in the name of or held by the Common Depositary or its nominee in immediately available funds to the Common Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered holder of such global note.
