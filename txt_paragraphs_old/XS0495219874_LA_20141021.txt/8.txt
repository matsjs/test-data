(3) interest, or
such reference shall be deemed to include payment of additional amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Company is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.
Under Swedish law as applied and interpreted on the date of this Offering Memorandum and as more fully described in "Certain tax considerations--Swedish taxation":
(i) the Company generally is not required to pay withholding tax in respect of the notes held by non residents of Sweden;
(ii) non-resident holders of notes generally will not be subject to estate duty or inheritance tax in respect of the notes in Sweden; and
(iii) a non-resident holder of notes who sells the notes generally will not be subject to Swedish capital gains tax.
Ranking
The notes will be general unsecured obligations of the Company that rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes. The notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities of the Company that are not so subordinated and will be effectively subordinated to all of our secured Indebtedness and liabilities of our Subsidiaries.
