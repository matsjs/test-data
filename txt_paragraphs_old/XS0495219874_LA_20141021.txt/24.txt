The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or supplement. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of notes given in connection with a tender of such holder's notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. After an amendment or supplement under the Indenture becomes effective, the Company is required to mail to the holders a notice briefly describing such amendment or supplement. However, the failure to give such notice to all the holders, or any defect in the notice will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment or supplement.
