(v) that all Bareboat Charters shall have a Bareboat Rate reflecting (i) the day rate under the relevant Drilling Contract, LESS operational expenses, general and administrative expenses and risk allocation between the relevant Charterer and the relevant Rig Owner thereunder, as well as on the basis o f applicable tax rules, but in any event being not less than (A) USD 85,000 (US Dollars eighty five thousand) per day until and including 30 June 2015, and (B) USD 95,000 (US Dollars ninety five thousand) per day thereafter, PLUS in the case of each of (A) and (B), VAT or other Taxes that the relevant Rig Owner shall be required to pay to the Mexican authorities in connection with the hire payments;
(vi) that to the extent that any Bareboat Charters currently in existence do not reflect the above conditions, the Issuer shall procure that such Bareboat Charters are amended as appropriate latest by the date of the First Disbursement. Drilling Contracts may only be entered into under a different structure than described in this Clause if required for tax or operational purposes and provided that the Bond Trustee (in the opinion of the Bond Trustee) obtains a no less favourable security position under such structure as contemplated in this Bond Agreement. Any structure related to a non-Mexican Drilling Contract will be adapted to applicable local laws and will include a security package and earnings waterfall mechanism ensuring that the Bareboat Rate under any Bareboat Charters relating to any non-Mexican Drilling Contracts shall be paid to the relevant Rig Owner Earnings Account with as little delay as permitted by law;
