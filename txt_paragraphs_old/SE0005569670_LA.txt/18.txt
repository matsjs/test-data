No delay or omission of the Agent or of any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy under the Finance Documents shall impair or operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy.
The Notes are denominated in Swedish Kronor and each Note is constituted by these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Notes and to comply with these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such agreement.
The initial nominal amount of each Note is SEK 1,000,000 (the " Nominal Amount"). All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 per cent of the Nominal Amount. The aggregated Nominal Amount of the Initial Notes subscribed for shall not be less than SEK 145,000,000 or the Issuer may reject the issue of the Notes.
Provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes up to an including 31 December 2015 without the Noteholders' approval. Any Subsequent Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and (for the avoidance of doubt) the ISIN, the interest rate, the initial nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The price of the Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount.
The maximum total nominal amount of the Notes (the Initial Notes and all Subsequent Notes) may not exceed SEK 500,000,000 unless the Noteholders have given their consent in accordance with Clause 17.5a). Each Subsequent Note shall

entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 9.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Notes.
