No Event of Default shall occur by reason of any suspension of, or failure to make, payments under the Participating Debenture except where such suspension or failure constitutes an event of default under the terms of the Participating Debenture.
The Agent shall notify the Noteholders of an Event of Default within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Agent received actual knowledge of that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. The Agent shall, within twenty (20) Business Days of the date on which the Agent received actual knowledge of that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, decide if the Notes shall be so accelerated. If the Agent decides not to accelerate the Notes, the Agent shall promptly seek instructions from the Noteholders in accordance with Clause 17 (Decisions by Noteholders). The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.
If the Noteholders instruct the Agent to accelerate the Notes, the Agent shall promptly declare the Notes due and payable and take such actions as may, in the opinion of the Agent, be necessary or desirable to enforce the rights of the Noteholders under the Finance Documents, unless the relevant Event of Default is no longer continuing.
If the right to accelerate the Notes is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of acceleration to be deemed to exist.

In the event of an acceleration of the Notes in accordance with this Clause 14, the Issuer shall redeem all Notes at the redemption amount per Note specified in Clause 10.3 (Voluntary total or partial redemption (call option)) as applicable depending on when the acceleration occurs. For the avoidance of doubt any acceleration occurring before 1 January 2016 shall be treated for the purpose of the redemption amount only as if it occurred after 31 January 2016 but before 1 January 2017.
