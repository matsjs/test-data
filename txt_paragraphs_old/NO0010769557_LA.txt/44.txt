Such Quiet Enjoyment Letter shall containing substantially the covenant set out in the following: The Bond Trustee may not interrupt the quiet use, possession and enjoyment of the Vessel by the Client, so long as no event is continuing which would entitle the Charterer (or the Sub Charterer, if applicable) to terminate the Charter Contract and except as required by any applicable law binding on the Bond Trustee, and provided that the Client, following receipt of notice of an event of default under the Bond Agreement makes due payments as instructed by the Bond Trustee in accordance with the Charter Contract Assignments.
