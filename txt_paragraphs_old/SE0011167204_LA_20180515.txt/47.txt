(b) The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent and the Bondholders upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, Listing Failure Event or Delisting, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as the Agent may request (acting reasonably) following receipt of such notice.
(d) The Issuer shall submit a Compliance Certificate to the Agent in connection with:
(i) the testing of the Incurrence Test; and
(ii) the delivery of the annual financial statements.
(e) The Agent may assume that any information provided by the Issuer in the Compliance Certificate delivered to it pursuant to Clause (d) above is correct, and the Agent shall not be responsible or liable for the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of such information.
(f) The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent (with full particulars) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of any of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.
(g) The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to this Clause 11.1 if informing the Agent would not conflict with any applicable laws or, when the Bonds are listed, the Issuer's registration contract with the Regulated Market. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek approval from the Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to this Clause 11.1.
