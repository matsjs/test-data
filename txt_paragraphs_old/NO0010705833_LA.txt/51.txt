(ii) the present value on the relevant record date of the remaining coupon payments (less any accrued but unpaid interest) through and including the Interest Payment Date in September 2015,
both calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable U,S. Treasury Rate (i.e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Bonds until the mentioned Interest Payment Date in September 2015) (plus accrued interest on redeemed amount) and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Securities Depository, and the Issuer in connection with the such repayment;
