Subscriptions notified by the Issuer as having been accepted shall be paid for as instructed in connection with the subscription. Notes subscribed and paid for shall be entered by the
Issuing Agent to the respective book-entry accounts of the subscribers on a date advised in connection with the issuance of the Notes in accordance with the Finnish legislation governing book-entry system and book-entry accounts as well as regulations and decisions of the CSD.
2.3 By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder, and, by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder (i) agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, (ii) agrees to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Finance Documents and (iii) agrees that the Noteholders' Agent is authorised to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement for itself and on behalf of the Noteholders. These Terms and Conditions are subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event any discrepancy between these Terms and Condition and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement shall prevail.
2.4 The nominal amount (Fin: arvo-osuuden yksikkokoko) of each Note is EUR 1,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). The aggregate nominal amount of the Notes is EUR 250,000,000. All Notes are issued on the Issue Date on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 percent of the Nominal Amount.
2.5 The Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer, except in respect of obligations which have priority pursuant to Clause 13.1, and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them. Until the occurrence of the Security Release Event the Notes constitute secured and guaranteed obligations of the Issuer secured by the Transaction Security and the Transaction Guarantees. The Transaction Security and the Transaction Guarantees also secure a major part of the other borrowings of the Issuer. The priority in respect of enforcement proceeds from the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees is referred to in Clause 9.1.6 and includes certain liabilities that have better priority than the Notes to such enforcement proceeds.
2.6 Each Note is freely transferable after it has been registered into the respective book-entry account of a Noteholder but the Noteholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Notes, as applicable, under local laws to which a Noteholder may be subject. Each Noteholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
