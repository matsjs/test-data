In recent years, there have been significant changes in the consumption of stainless steel grade groups, mainly attributable to higher and more volatile nickel prices and increased stainless steel production in China and India. These factors have contributed to a decrease in the relative consumption of 300 series (nickel containing) stainless steel grades and an increase of no nickel (ferritic) stainless steel grades and low nickel stainless steel grades (200 series, lean duplex). From over 75 percent of total finished stainless steel consumption in the 1990s, the relative consumption of 300 series stainless steel declined to approximately 53 percent in 2015. Over this period, the relative consumption of ferritic, 200 series and duplex stainless steel grades have increased to approximately 27 percent, 19 percent and 2 percent, respectively (source: SMR, April 2016).
In 2015, consumption of both ferritic and duplex stainless steel grades grew at around 3 percent compared to the consumption in 2014. The 300 series stainless steel consumption grew by around 1 percent while consumption of 200 series stainless steel grades remained on same levels as in 2014. Between 2016 and 2017, SMR forecasts that ferritic stainless steel grades will be the fastest growing in terms of consumption (4 percent CAGR), while duplex and 200 series stainless steel grades are expected to grow annually at around 3 percent and 2 percent
