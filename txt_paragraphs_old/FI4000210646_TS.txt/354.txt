Consumption growth of the stainless steel products in the NAFTA stagnated in 2015, despite the robust growth of 8 percent in Mexico. Growth in the United States was flat on the back of weakness in the manufacturing sector driven firstly by collapsed investment in the oil and gas industry, and secondly on weaker exports due to the strong dollar. Meanwhile, consumption levels in South America were 13 percent lower in 2015 compared with 2014, amid a slump of 14 percent in Brazil (source: SMR, April 2016).
