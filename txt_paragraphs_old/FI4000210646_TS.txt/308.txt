The Intercreditor Agreement contains mechanisms for further creditors, guarantors and intra-group lenders acceding thereto. By acceding to the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with its terms further creditors may become Secured Parties benefiting from the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees, further guarantors would constitute additional Transaction Guarantees for all Secured Obligations and further intre-group lenders would result in further intra-group debt being subordinated to the Secured Obligations.
The Intercreditor Agreement contains various conditions on the requirements for effecting amendments to the terms thereof. Amendments that shorten contractually scheduled maturity or redemption date, amortization profile or reduces average weighted life of a facility or introduces scheduled reductions in available commitments, require consent of the majority senior creditors. The Intercreditor Agreement entirely restricts amendments that conflict with the Intercreditor Agreement or create a default under another debt document with respect to any action or event that is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. Also, where an amendment to the Transaction Security relates to the nature or scope of the collateral assets, the manner in which enforcement proceeds are distributed or to the release of Transaction Security, such amendments may only be made with the consent of each creditor group representative.

In consideration of the maturity of the Notes and the maturity of the other Secured Obligations, it is possible that in connection with a refinancing of certain of such other Secured Obligations, the Intercreditor Agreement will be replaced by a new intercreditor agreement and the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees will be released and re-granted. Pursuant to the Terms and Conditions, the Noteholders' Agent is authorized to take actions needed for the amendment and replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement and the release and, where applicable, the retake of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees provided that from the perspective of the Noteholders the ranking among the external debt covered by the new intercreditor and the application of proceeds from any security and guarantees is not less beneficial than under the Intercreditor Agreement and that any Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees benefit the Notes alike the other Secured Obligations.
