Release of Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees
The Security Agent is pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement entitled on behalf of all Secured Parties to release any part of the Transaction Security in certain circumstances subject to and in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent is authorized to release relevant part of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees and to discharge Secured Obligations and certain intra-group liabilities in order to facilitate enforcement of Transaction Security or a distressed disposal or appropriation made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that in connection with a disposal of an asset by a member of the Group permitted under the terms of the secured financing under non-distressed circumstances, the Security Agent is under the Intercreditor Agreement authorized to release Transaction Security over that asset and where the asset consists of shares in a Group company, Transaction Guarantee and Transaction Security granted by such company. The Intercreditor Agreement obliges each Secured Party to take actions necessary to effect such releases and discharges for non-distressed disposals and distressed disposals and appropriation.
Application o f disposal and capital markets proceeds
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the net proceeds from any disposals or the issuance of capital markets instruments (excluding debt capital markets instruments resulting in proceeds of EUR 10 million or less) must first be applied towards prepayment and cancellation of the Liquidity Facility and second, on a pro rata and pari passu basis to the Revolving Facility and other secured creditors (to the extent that the relevant secured creditor has a prepayment right under the terms of the relevant loan facility). The Liquidity Facility has been cancelled in full.
Changes to the parties
The Intercreditor Agreement contains mechanisms for further creditors, guarantors and intra-group lenders acceding thereto. By acceding to the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with its terms further creditors may become Secured Parties benefiting from the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees, further guarantors would constitute additional Transaction Guarantees for all Secured Obligations and further intre-group lenders would result in further intra-group debt being subordinated to the Secured Obligations.
