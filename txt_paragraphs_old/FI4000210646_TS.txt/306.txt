Secured Obligations may be paid in accordance with their terms until an acceleration event occurs or any Transaction Security is being enforced. Thereafter the waterfall referred to above applies. Although intra-Group liabilities are subordinated, payments for such liabilities are generally permitted when due except when an event of default is outstanding and the Security Agent has prohibited such payment.
(a) in insolvency proceedings to take enforcement action (other than in respect of enforcement of Transaction Security or entering into any compromise with the Issuer or any Guarantor being the subject of the insolvency proceeding);
(b) to make a claim in the winding-up, dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event of a debtor for liabilities owed to the relevant Secured Party;
(c) following the occurrence of an event of default acceleration of the Notes or other Secured Obligations owed to the Noteholders or the Noteholders' Agent in accordance with the Terms and Conditions; and
(d) suing for, commencing or joining any legal or arbitration proceedings against the Issuer or any provider of Transaction Security or Transaction Guarantee to recover the Secured Obligations owed to the Noteholders or the Noteholders' Agent in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Enforcement of Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees is pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement permitted only through the Security Agent and on instructing group instructions. Each creditor is obliged to vote in any official insolvency or rehabilitation proceeding relating to a group company as instructed by the Security Agent.
In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement sets out the enforcement mechanics for the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees, including, among other things, enforcement trigger events pursuant to which the Transaction Security may become enforceable, provisions regarding non-cash recoveries, certain consultation obligations for the different creditor groups and other similar limitations and conditions.
Turnover
Any amount received by a Secured Party contrary to the Intercreditor Agreement, by way of set-off, after the occurrence of a distress event, as a result of any litigation or proceedings (other than insolvency) or proceeds of any enforcement of Transaction Security or Transaction Guarantees not distributed in accordance with the waterfall, is (or cash-value of a non-cash receipt) required to be promptly paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Any such amounts are subject to sharing provisions that apply among Secured Parties.
