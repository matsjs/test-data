In addition, under the Terms and Conditions and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Group will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce it.
Further, the Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security, or the enforcement thereof, will be subject to certain contractual or other limitations or subordinated under applicable law. The enforcement of the Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security will be limited to the extent that the granting of such Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security is not in the corporate interest of the relevant guarantor or provider of security, would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or where the burden of such Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security exceed the benefit to the relevant guarantor or provider of security. In particular, contractual limits may be applicable to certain Transaction Guarantees or Transaction Security to the extent the granting of such Transaction Guarantee or enforcement of relevant Transaction Security would result in a breach of capital maintenance rules or other statutory laws or would cause the directors of any Guarantor or provider of Transaction Security to contravene their duties to incur civil or criminal liability or to contravene any legal prohibition.
Enforcing rights under the N otes or the Transaction Guarantees or the Transaction Security across m ultiple jurisdictions m ay prove difficult
The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Finland and certain of the Guarantors and Security Providers are incorporated or organized under the laws of various other jurisdictions. The Transaction Security includes the shares of certain of the Issuer's subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of these jurisdictions. The Transaction Guarantees are provided under the Intercreditor Agreement which is governed by English law. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in various jurisdictions. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of the Noteholders' rights. Noteholders rights under the Notes, the Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the Security Agent will be able to effectively enforce the Secured Parties' rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The multijurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Transaction Security may limit the realizable value of the Transaction Security. The validity of the Transaction Security may be subject to challenge and Transaction Security may be set aside in insolvency proceedings.
Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all Transaction Security give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Transaction Security or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the assets subject to Transaction Security.
Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees m ay be released under certain circumstances
In addition to the authority for the Security Agent to release relevant part of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees and to discharge Secured Obligations and certain intra-group liabilities in order to facilitate enforcement of Transaction Security or a distressed disposal or appropriation made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that in connection with a disposal of an asset by a member of the Group permitted under the terms of the secured financing under non-distressed circumstances, the Security Agent is under the Intercreditor Agreement authorized to release Transaction Security over that asset and where the asset consists of shares in a Group company, Transaction Guarantee and Transaction Security granted by such company. Although the Transaction Security shall be released pro rata between the Secured Parties and continue to rank pari passu between the Secured Parties, such release will impair the security interest and the secured position of the Noteholders.
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes provide that the Noteholders' Agent shall in certain circumstances agreed therein, take actions necessary to release the Transaction Guarantees and Transaction Security or part thereof.
The Noteholders' Agent shall also take actions necessary to release all Transaction Guarantees and/or Transaction Security if (a) the Secured Parties representing at least 66.67 percent of the Secured Obligations agree to release all of the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees; or (b) upon the Issuer reaching the Investment Grade Status, the Secured Parties representing at least 50 percent of the Secured Obligations agree to release all of the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees; or (c) the Secured Obligations (other than in respect of the Notes or other senior notes issued by the Issuer and benefiting from the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees) have been refinanced, are agreed to be amended to
