The shorter tenor o f the other Secured Obligations may have a negative impact on the interests o f the N o teh o ld ers.
While the Transaction Security secures the Secured Parties pari passu (with certain exception), the Notes and the other Secured Obligations do not have the same tenor and the Issuer may amortise and make prepayments under the other Secured Obligations without having to make corresponding amortisations or prepayments under the Notes. The shorter tenor of the other Secured Obligations could have a negative impact on the interests of the Noteholders.
The Intercreditor Agreem ent and the Transaction Security Docum ents m ay be am ended without the consent o f the Noteholders
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes provide for the Noteholders' Agent to agree to amendments and replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement and grant waivers and consents and give written instructions in respect of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents without consulting the Noteholders provided that the ranking of external debt and the priority of payments under such debt does not become less beneficial to the Noteholders than under the Intercreditor Agreement in force on the Issue Date and that in relation to Transaction Security Documents such amendment, waiver, consent or instructions do not relate to a release of the Transaction Security except as expressly agreed in the Terms and Conditions. Any of the before-mentioned actions may result in less beneficial rights and more cumbersome obligations for the Noteholders under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents.
The Notes and each o f the Transaction Guarantees are structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities o f non-Guarantor subsidiaries
The Noteholders (and the other Secured Parties) benefit from guarantees provided by certain of the Issuer's subsidiaries. In the event of insolvency, liquidation or a similar event relating to one of the guarantors, all other creditors of such subsidiary would be entitled to payment out of the assets of such subsidiary with the same priority as the Noteholders to the extent the Transaction Security does not provide for a prioritised position for the Secured Parties. In case of such an insolvency event in a subsidiary not being a guarantor, an entity within the Group, as a shareholder, or the Noteholders as Secured Parties in relation to a share pledge over the shares in such subsidiary would be entitled to any payments only after the other creditors have received full payment for their claims. Thus the Notes are in the latter case structurally subordinated to the liabilities of such subsidiaries.
Defaults by, or the insolvency of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer could result in the obligation of the Group to make payments under parent company financial or performance guarantees in respect of such subsidiaries' obligations or the occurrence of cross defaults on certain borrowings of the Group.
The Transaction Guarantees and Transaction Security are subject to certain limitations on enforcem ent and m ay be lim ited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that m ay lim it their validity and enforceability
