Defaults by, or the insolvency of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer could result in the obligation of the Group to make payments under parent company financial or performance guarantees in respect of such subsidiaries' obligations or the occurrence of cross defaults on certain borrowings of the Group.
According to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents certain Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by the relevant Guarantor or Security Provider without rendering the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each Transaction Guarantee and Transaction Security would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Transaction Guarantees or Transaction Security granted under the Intercreditor Agreement and by relevant Transaction Security Documents and, if payment had already been

made under a Transaction Guarantee or upon enforcement of the Transaction Security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or Security Provider, if the court found that:
 the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or Security Provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or Security Provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security;
 the Guarantor or Security Provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security and the Guarantor or Security Provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;
 the relevant Transaction Guarantees or Transaction Security were held to exceed the corporate objective of the Guarantor or Security Provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or Security Provider; or
 the amount paid or payable under the relevant Transaction Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds in respect of the Transaction Security was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.
