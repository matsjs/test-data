6.2 If, due to any obstacle affecting the CSD, the Issuer cannot make a payment, such payment may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. Any such postponement shall not affect the Record Time.
6.4 All payments to be made by the Issuer pursuant to these Terms and Conditions shall be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim.

INTEREST
7.1 Each Note carries Interest at the applicable Interest Rate from (and including) the Issue Date up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
7.2 Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Notes shall be made to the Noteholders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
7.3 Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve months of 30 days each and, in case of an incomplete month, the actual number of days elapsed (30/360 -day basis).
7.4 If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (and including) the due date up to (but excluding) the date of actual payment at a rate which is one (1) percentage point higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Noteholders' Agent, the Issuing Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
