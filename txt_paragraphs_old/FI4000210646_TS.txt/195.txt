Rights in the Transaction Security m ay be adversely affected by thefailu re to perfect the Transaction Security
Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured creditor or the security provider. The Transaction Security may not be perfected if the Security Agent or the relevant security provider is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of any such security. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant Transaction Security or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Transaction Security. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that Outokumpu will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Transaction Security, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that is purported to be covered by the Transaction Security or the perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Transaction Security or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Secured Parties against third parties including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim Transaction Security.
