Global real demand for stainless steel products reached 37.6 million tonnes in 2015, with a modest increase of around 2 percent from 37.1 million tonnes in 2014 and after annual average growth of around 8 percent between 2011 and 2014. The deceleration of growth was most pronounced in the APAC and Americas regions, where the growth slowed clearly below the average rates of previous years. Slowing economies in emerging markets, notably China, broadbased weakness in global manufacturing and deteriorating nickel prices resulted in weaker demand growth in 2015 compared with previous years. Real demand for stainless steel in the Europe reached 5.9 million tonnes in 2015, which means increase of modest 1 percent from 2014 despite the expected fragile recovery of the economy on the back of a weaker euro, low oil prices and less expensive credit. Of the major Western European countries, the demand for stainless steel in Germany and in Italy grew around 2 percent, while consumption levels in France and Benelux shrank (source: SMR, April 2016).
Consumption growth of the stainless steel products in the NAFTA stagnated in 2015, despite the robust growth of 8 percent in Mexico. Growth in the United States was flat on the back of weakness in the manufacturing sector driven firstly by collapsed investment in the oil and gas industry, and secondly on weaker exports due to the strong dollar. Meanwhile, consumption levels in South America were 13 percent lower in 2015 compared with 2014, amid a slump of 14 percent in Brazil (source: SMR, April 2016).
Global stainless steel demand is forecasted to reach 38.0 and 39.2 million tonnes in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Between 2016 and 2017, global stainless steel consumption is expected to increase at an annual average growth rate of around 2 percent, while growth is estimated to be mainly driven by increased consumption of around 3 percent in China and 2 percent in Asia, excluding China. Meanwhile, demand in Europe and NAFTA is estimated to remain on relatively stable levels without growth (source: SMR, April 2016).
