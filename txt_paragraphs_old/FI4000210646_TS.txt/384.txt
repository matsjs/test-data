Outokumpu uses a variety of means to transport products to customers, including truck, ship and train. Outokumpu primarily transports products between its production facilities by ship and train as well as by truck. Within Europe, the Tornio production facility supplies a portion of the black hot band feedstock to its cold rolling facility in Germany. This material is transported from Outokumpu's own harbor at the Tornio site to Outokumpu's finishing facility in Terneuzen, the Netherlands using Outokumpu's fleet of four time-chartered vessels. The material is then transported by train to the production facilities. Train is also the primary means of transporting products between Outokumpu's production facilities in Germany. Outokumpu maximizes the utilization of its vessels by transporting recycled stainless steel, other raw materials and consumables from ports such as Rotterdam on the return trip to Tornio.
In North America, Outokumpu transports products from the Calvert production facility to its cold rolling facility in Mexico primarily by ship. The Calvert production facility is located on a site that includes a barge terminal owned by third parties. Outokumpu expects to increasingly spot charter vessels in the future, primarily to transport ferrochrome and stainless steel from the Tornio production facility to the Calvert production facility.
