Outokumpu's production facilities use a range of energy sources, including electricity and fossil fuels such as natural gas, propane, heavy and light fuel oil. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Outokumpu's electricity consumption was 4.96 terawatt hours and fossil fuel use totaled 3.20 terawatt hours. The major fossil fuel used by Outokumpu is natural gas, with propane, heavy and light fuel oil also being used. Outokumpu also uses carbon monoxide gas produced as a byproduct of ferrochrome smelting as an energy source in stainless steel production at the Tornio integrated production facility.
In 2014, Outokumpu entered into a joint venture, Manga LNG Oy, together with Ruukki Metals Oy (currently SSAB Europe Oy), EPV Energy Ltd and Skangass in order to construct a fully operational LNG terminal and storage tank investment in Tornio, Finland. The investment of approximately EUR 100 million was conditional upon granting of a state subsidy for the project. The state subsidy was granted in September 2014 and the investment decision regarding the terminal made in December 2014. The objective is to have the terminal in operation in the beginning of 2018. Outokumpu has a 45 percent ownership in Manga LNG Oy.
