Short-term Actions
 A reduction of EUR 100 million in sales, general and administrative costs (SG&A) by the end of 2017 against the baseline of EUR 400 million at the end of 2015; and
 A cash release of at least EUR 200 million from net working capital by the end of 2016, particularly through the reduction of inventory carry.
Outokumpu considers gearing (debt-to-equity ratio) to be a relevant key indicator for the health of the Company in the cyclical stainless steel sector. Outokumpu is targeting to reduce its net debt to EUR 1.2 billion by the end of 2017, driven mainly by the expected improvement in operational performance as well as a significant uplift in net working capital efficiency.

Long-term Financial Targets In connection with the new vision, Outokumpu has defined long-term financial targets to reflect the progress of its strategic initiatives and the development in profitability and further deleveraging:
 EBIT of EUR 500 million;  ROCE of 12 percent; and  Gearing of less than 35 percent These group-level targets are expected by the Company to be reached by the end of 2020 at the latest. While the global demand for stainless steel continues to grow, Outokumpu takes a conservative approach on the market growth and metal price assumptions, and expects the targeted profitability improvement to come primarily through efficiency and cost improvements in the current scope of business, supported by further strengthening of Outokumpu's cost competitiveness and market position particularly in the Americas.
