German Labor Agreements
Prior to the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on January 31, 2012, Outokumpu Oyj, ThyssenKrupp and the German employee representatives reached an agreement regarding the production facilities and employment protection in Germany. In accordance with the agreement, the Krefeld melt shop was closed in the end of 2013 and it was envisaged that the Bochum melt shop could be closed by the end of 2016. The economic viability of the Bochum melt shop was to be reviewed prior to the final decisions on its closure. All other Outokumpu production sites in Germany were to be retained until the end of 2015. The parties also agreed that there were to be no compulsory redundancies at any Outokumpu production sites in Germany until the end of 2015. In the Business Combination Agreement, ThyssenKrupp agreed to offer alternative jobs at ThyssenKrupp to up to 600 employees currently employed by Outokumpu.
On October 1, 2013, Outokumpu began discussions with German employee representatives to change a collective (tariff) agreement that was signed in connection with the Inoxum Acquisition. The principal requested changes were:
· accelerating the closure of the melt shop in Bochum to the beginning of 2015 instead of the end of 2016, depending on the negotiations;
· additional headcount reductions up to 1,000 employees; and
· a reduction of the investment in the Krefeld production facility as a precondition to close the Benrath production facility from EUR 244 million to EUR 100 million.
On March 30, 2014 Outokumpu entered into an Amendment to the existing Tariff Agreement in which the terms and conditions for the above-mentioned principals have been agreed upon with the German union IG Metall. The main principles of this amendment were:
