In 2015, consumption of both ferritic and duplex stainless steel grades grew at around 3 percent compared to the consumption in 2014. The 300 series stainless steel consumption grew by around 1 percent while consumption of 200 series stainless steel grades remained on same levels as in 2014. Between 2016 and 2017, SMR forecasts that ferritic stainless steel grades will be the fastest growing in terms of consumption (4 percent CAGR), while duplex and 200 series stainless steel grades are expected to grow annually at around 3 percent and 2 percent
respectively. Meanwhile, the consumption of the 300 series stainless steel grades is expected to grow by only 1 percent annually on average (source: SMR, April 2016).
Production
Global crude stainless steel production was 42.1 million tonnes in 2015, a decrease of 1.7 percent compared to 2014. This was the first time since 2009 that production shrank, and the decline was broad-based between the regions. In Europe, stainless steel production was 7.1 million tonnes in 2015, a decrease of 1.4 percent compared to 2014. In China, stainless steel production grew at an annual average pace of around 19 percent between 2007 and 2014, but decreased by 2.0 percent to 22.3 million tonnes in 2015. Of the major regions and countries, only India and South Africa increased output in 2015 compared to 2014 (source: SMR, February 2016).
In response to strong demand for stainless steel products from China in the 1990s and early 2000s, the European stainless steel industry made significant investments in increasing production capacity. However, during the 2000s, China rapidly invested in the construction of local stainless steel production capacity. As China transitioned from being a net importer of stainless steel to being the world's largest stainless steel producer and a net exporter of stainless steel products, the capacity utilization levels of stainless steel producers in other regions decreased. With Chinese stainless steel producers serving domestic demand and increasingly exporting their material around the world, stainless steel producers in other countries have been forced to find new markets for production that was previously destined for China as well as for production destined for their local demand, which Chinese producers have increasingly been serving. Moreover, price advantages in Asia keep up the attractiveness of imported material in the European market. The price advantages result from the high investments of Asian mills in new state-of-the art facilities with high production capacities, economies of scale and partially from cost advantages, for example, from using alternative raw materials such as nickel pig iron. These pressures have led to substantially higher levels of stainless steel imports into the European market, which increased from around 20 percent of total consumption (of cold rolled flat products) between 2011 and 2012 to 30.6 percent in 2014. In 2015 import levels decreased to 24.6 percent after introduction of anti-dumping duties by EU commission for Chinese and Taiwanese cold rolled imports. Asia accounted for approximately 64 percent of the total amount of cold rolled imports into the Europe in 2015, down from 78 percent in 2014 and from 72 percent on average between 2012 and 2013 (source: EUROFER May 2016). Average cold rolled imports into NAFTA increased to 23.7 percent of the total consumption in 2015, up from 19.6 percent in 2014 and 13.4 percent in 2013 after surge of volumes from Asia after anti-dumping duties for Chinese and Taiwanese were imposed in Europe in 2015 (source: AISI, May 2016).
Rapid growth in Chinese stainless steel production capacity combined with low growth in European stainless steel consumption has exacerbated the overcapacity in Europe and limited growth opportunities for European stainless steel producers, particularly in standard grades. In addition to price pressure, overcapacity has resulted in lower production capacity utilization rates for European producers. The production of stainless steel is capital intensive and producers generally seek to maintain high capacity utilization levels to improve their profitability. Increased stainless steel production capacity in Asia, especially increased melting capacity, has reduced demand for European semi-finished products to negligible levels.
Stainless Steel Competition
The global crude stainless steel capacity in 2015, including flat and long products, totaled approximately 68.4 million tonnes, up slightly from 68.1 million tonnes in 2014. The largest producers based on crude stainless capacity are Tsingshan, TISCO, POSCO, Outokumpu, Baosteel, Acerinox, Aperam and LISCO (source: SMR, February 2016).
Outokumpu's primary competitors in Europe in 2015 were Aperam, Acerinox and AST, which are all global suppliers, and Outokumpu also competed with imports from outside of Europe (primarily from Taiwan, South Korea, China, Japan, India, South Africa and the United States). Local suppliers generally account for the majority of stainless steel sales in other regional markets in which local presence, knowledge and often trade barriers may provide them with advantages. In NAFTA, the main stainless steel producers are North American Stainless (a member of the Acerinox group), Outokumpu, AK Steel Corporation and ATI Allegheny Ludlum Corporation. In Asia, the significant new capacity built in recent years has resulted in a fragmented market where there are more than 50 manufacturers. Local producers mostly focus on lower margin commodity products, making it difficult to gain market share in the commodity products market. China is a highly competitive market
