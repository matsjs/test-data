 the relevant Transaction Guarantees or Transaction Security were held to exceed the corporate objective of the Guarantor or Security Provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or Security Provider; or
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:
 the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;
 the present fair salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or
 it cannot pay its debts as they become due.
If a court were to find that the granting of a Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security was a fraudulent conveyance or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that such Transaction Security or the payment obligations under such Transaction Guarantee is ineffective, and/or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, the Noteholders may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or the benefit of such Transaction Security and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of the other Guarantors under any Transaction Guarantees that have not been declared void and benefit of other Transaction Security that have not been declared void.
Additionally, any future pledge of Transaction Security might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtorin-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge, or in certain circumstances, a longer period. In order to receive the benefit of a security interest, the secured creditors must hold secured claims (i.e., the secured party and the creditor have to be the same person).
In addition, under the Terms and Conditions and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Group will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce it.
