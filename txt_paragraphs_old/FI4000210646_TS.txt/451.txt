Prospects
"Outokumpu expects that the stainless steel market conditions will continue to be challenging in the second quarter amid global economic uncertainties and subdued raw material prices. In Europe, the underlying demand in key sectors outside of Oil and Gas is expected to continue healthy but stock levels among distributors are still above historical averages. Market dynamics in Americas are showing some improvement: stock levels among distributors have come down, price increases have been announced and Chinese imports are being addressed with antidumping investigation.
Market uncertainties warrant prudence in the outlook statement for the second quarter. While steady progress in stainless business is expected, results will be burdened by weaker performance of the ferrochrome business driven by low ferrochrome price and USD/EUR exchange rate. Outokumpu expects its delivery volumes to be sequentially flat and the underlying EBIT to remain at a similar level as in the first quarter. With current prices, the net impact of raw material-related inventory and metal derivative gains/losses on profitability is expected to be marginal, if any.
Outokumpu is finalizing plans for the announced EUR 100 million reduction in its SG&A costs and estimates to book approximately EUR 40 million of redundancy provisions in the second quarter, out of which approximately EUR 5 million is expected to be cash effective during the quarter.
This outlook reflects the current scope of operations."
