· New organizational set-up meaning a simplified organization with three business areas, less management layers and a lighter cost structure;
· A reduction of EUR 100 million in sales, general and administrative costs (SG&A) by the end of 2017 against the baseline of EUR 400 million at the end of 2015; and
· A cash release of at least EUR 200 million from net working capital by the end of 2016, particularly through the reduction of inventory carry.
Outokumpu's current expectations regarding the impact and timing of the abovementioned measures are based on a number of assumptions and expectations that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. In the event that the measures are not sufficient or they materialize slower than is currently expected, Outokumpu may not be able to comply with the financial covenants based on gearing and liquidity levels and other conditions set forth in its

financing agreements in the medium term. If Outokumpu is unable to comply with conditions set forth in its financing agreements, this would result in an event of default, which could cause a significant proportion of Outokumpu's borrowings to become repayable on demand, unless waived by the lenders or refinanced. There can be no assurance that Outokumpu would be able to obtain a waiver of such conditions from lenders or to refinance the relevant borrowings on terms that are acceptable to it, or at all. A default would permit the creditors of such borrowings to accelerate their maturity and enforce the Transaction Security. This could result in forced sale of material subsidiary companies and business assets of Outokumpu, and could cause defaults under Outokumpu's other debt obligations, and as a result, ultimately result in the insolvency or the liquidation of Outokumpu.

Outokumpu is finalizing structural changes in its European operations aimed at improving financial performance and efficiency. See "Information about the Issuer - Investments, Divestments and Other Recent Events - Europe Restructuring". One of the main targets of the restructuring following the Inoxum Acquisition has been to improve capacity utilization in Europe through the concentration of melting activities in the Tornio and Avesta production facilities and the reduction of cold rolling capacity in Germany through the transfer of its cold rolling production in Benrath to Outokumpu's Krefeld production facility. Following the Bochum melt shop closure at the end of June 2015, melting has been transferred to Tornio and Avesta and cold rolling in Germany is concentrated in Krefeld and Dillenburg. The next milestones are intended to be the Benrath site closure in 2016 and the completion of the investment in ferritic stainless steel capacity in Krefeld by 2017. The European restructuring program is currenly progressing as planned with about EUR 35 million savings obtained by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and the full cumulative savings of EUR 100 million expected by the end of 2017. However, there can be no assurance that additional costs will not arise in connection with the restructuring in Europe or other synergy, cost saving or other efficiency measures, which could result in the provisions and total one-off cash cost estimates being insufficient and have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
