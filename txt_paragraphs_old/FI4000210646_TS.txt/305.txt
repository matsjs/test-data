Creditor groups and voting
The Secured Parties are pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement divided into creditor groups entitling each group to only one vote with all credit participations pertaining to such group (calculated on the basis of commitments, where applicable). The groups are formed from the creditors under the different facilities as follows: Revolving facility as well as each syndicated facility, bilateral lender and additional senior financing forming their own group. Within the groups the decision making follows the terms and conditions of the relevant financing.
