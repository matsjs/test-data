In Europe, global consumption of stainless steel products in the Automotive and Heavy Transport segment increased 4 percent and outperformed other segments in 2015 as it grew even faster than in the past few years. In contrast, consumption in Chemical, Petrochemical and Energy and Industrial and Heavy Industry segments were the weakest of all segments as their demand decreased by 1 percent compared to the consumption in 2014 (source: SMR, April 2016).
Outokumpu believes that the overall long-term prospects for stainless steel demand remain positive. Key global megatrends in urbanization, modernization and increased mobility combined with growing global demand for energy, food and water are expected to promote the growth of stainless steel demand in the future. SMR forecasts an average annual growth rate of around 2 percent (CAGR) for global stainless steel consumption between 2016 and 2017, mainly attributable to increased demand from the Architecture, Building, Construction and Infrastructure and the Consumer Goods and Medical, which is expected to be around 4 percent, while also Automotive and Heavy Transport is expected to grow at around 3 percent annually between 2016 and 2017 (source: SMR, April 2016).
