A significant portion of Outokumpu's indebtedness is secured by the Transaction Security. This is likely to limit Outokumpu's ability to obtain unsecured financing as long as any secured debt is outstanding. For example, Outokumpu has utilized commercial paper programs to manage its short-term liquidity needs and expects to continue to do so in the near to medium term; however, there can be no certainty that it will be able to continue to obtain such financing on the same or similar terms as in the past. Although the Intercreditor Agreement entered into in connection with the granting of the Transaction Security and the various financing arrangements do not prohibit Outokumpu from incurring secured indebtedness in the future, they do contain certain restrictions with respect to the types and/or amount of secured indebtedness that Outokumpu may incur in the future. Also, the terms and conditions of the convertible notes maturing in 2020 may have implications when incurring new secured capital market debt. The coupon of the convertible notes increases when incurring new secured capital market debt exceeding the principal amount of EUR 250 million and the convertible notes are required become secured if the amount of new secured capital market debt exceeds EUR 650 million. Any of the foregoing may limit Outokumpu's ability to raise additional financing on commercially acceptable terms or at all, and as a result, have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.

While Outokumpu has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past few years, the Company continues to have high level of indebtedness (as at March 31, 2016 net debt was EUR 1,551 million), which requires Outokumpu to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to make payments on indebtedness. Outokumpu's high level of indebtedness also increases Outokumpu's vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and limits Outokumpu's flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the stainless steel market. This could place Outokumpu at a competitive disadvantage as compared to less leveraged competitors

and competitors that have more favorable access to capital resources. Outokumpu may also be required to accept less attractive terms from its suppliers due to its strained financial condition, which would increase its costs and have an adverse effect on its profitability. As described in "Industry and market overview - Stainless Steel Market', the stainless steel industry is affected by global economic conditions and the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty continues to have a material adverse effect on demand for stainless steel.
As Outokumpu's sales are mainly derived from Europe, the continuation of any economic instability in the region could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
In addition, any deterioration of economic conditions in other regions in which Outokumpu has significant operations, such as in the United States and Mexico, or weakening of economic conditions in emerging economies that are substantial consumers of stainless steel (such as Brazil, India and China as well as certain other emerging countries), could result in a prolonged period of slower growth, which could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any significant deterioration of economic condition in the Unites States and Mexico would have an impact on the commercial ramp-up of the Calvert integrated stainless steel production facility, which could delay or prevent the improvement in the profitability of the Americas business area currently expected by Outokumpu.
