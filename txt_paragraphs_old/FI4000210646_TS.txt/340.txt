Outokumpu will focus on the following six areas to reach its vision:
 High performing organization: a lean, simple and flat organization that takes its lead from market trends and requirements, and drives a high level of individual accountability that is enforced through vigorous performance management;
 Word-class supply chain: the role of the supply chain function elevated to drive optimal matching of market demand and the manufacturing capabilities, managing manufacturing programming and planning as well as the required resources and logistics. This will allow the Company's production units to focus on achieving a benchmark level in cost efficiency;
 Manufacturing excellence: implementing a standardized operating model to ensure continuous productivity gains in all the mills across the Company, leading to industry benchmark competitiveness;
 Americas: the single biggest profitability improvement lever for Outokumpu, with significant improvement potential in both cost and market position; and
 Portfolio: continuous review of product portfolio, assets and operations to maximize the profitability of the business and minimize complexity.
While work has started in all areas, reaching the full potential and run rate impact is expected to take some years triggering the need for a set of immediate measures to deliver a step change in the Company cost and competitive position.
