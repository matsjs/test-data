Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area
In relation to each member state of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State") an offer to the public of any Notes may not be made in that Relevant Member State (other than Finland) except that an offer of the Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State may be made pursuant to
69
the following exemptions from the Prospectus Directive, if they have been implemented in that Relevant Member State:
(a) to any legal entity that is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;
(b) to fewer than 100, or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provisions of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive; or
(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,
provided that no such offer of Notes shall result in a requirement for the Company or the Lead Managers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer to the public" in relation to any of the Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and any Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase any Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State, the expression "2010 PD Amending Directive" means Directive 2010/73/EU amending the Prospectus Directive.
