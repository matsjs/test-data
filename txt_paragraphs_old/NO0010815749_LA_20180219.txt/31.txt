(c) The Agent shall only have to examine the face of a power of attorney or other proof of authorisation that has been provided to it pursuant to Clause 6(b) and may assume that it has been duly authorised, is valid, has not been revoked or superseded and that it is in full force and effect, unless otherwise is apparent from its face.
(a) The Issuer will unconditionally make available to or to the order of the Agent and/or the Paying Agent all amounts due on each payment date pursuant to the terms of these Terms and Conditions at such times and to such accounts as specified by the Agent and/or the Paying Agent in advance of each payment date or when other payments are due and payable pursuant to these Terms and Conditions.
(b) All payments to the Bondholders in relation to the Bonds shall be made to each Bondholder registered as such in the CSD at the relevant Record Date, by, if no specific order is made by the Agent, crediting the relevant amount to the bank account nominated by such Bondholder in connection with its securities account in the CSD.
(c) If a payment date to the Bondholders pursuant to the Finance Documents falls on a day on which either of the relevant CSD settlement system or the relevant currency settlement system for the Bonds are not open, the payment shall be made on the first following possible day on which both of the said systems are open, unless any provision to the contrary have been set out for such payment in the relevant Finance Document.
(d) If, due to any obstacle for the CSD, the Issuer cannot make a payment or repayment, such payment or repayment may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. Interest shall accrue in accordance with Clause 8(d) during such postponement.
(e) If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Clause 7, the Issuer and the CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay, irrespective of whether such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount.
(f) The Issuer is not liable to gross-up any payments under the Finance Documents by virtue of any withholding tax, public levy or the similar.
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms and Conditions, the Bonds shall be subject to, and any payments made in relation thereto shall be made in accordance with, the rules and procedures of the CSD.
