Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (i) to (iv) above shall be paid to the Issuer or the Guarantors, as applicable.
(d) If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 16, the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Bondholders of any such payment at least 15 Business Days before the payment is made.
