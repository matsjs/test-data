(b) Clause 23(a) shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Bondholders in accordance with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a
Bondholder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 21.1(c)), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance Documents or the Fee Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 21.2(i), such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 21.2(j) before a Bondholder may take any action referred to in Clause 23(a).
(c) The provisions of Clause 23(a) shall not in any way limit an individual Bondholder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 9.6 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event (put option)) or other payments which are due by the Issuer to some but not all Bondholders.
24. Prescription
(a) The right to receive repayment of the principal of the Bonds shall be prescribed and become void ten years from the Redemption Date. The right to receive payment of interest (excluding any capitalised interest) shall be prescribed and become void three years from the relevant due date for payment. The Issuer is entitled to any funds set aside for payments in respect of which the Bondholders' right to receive payment has been prescribed and has become void.
(b) If a limitation period is duly interrupted in accordance with the Swedish Act on Limitations (preskriptionslag (1981:130)), a new limitation period of ten years with respect to the right to receive repayment of the principal of the Bonds, and of three years with respect to receive payment of interest (excluding capitalised interest) will commence, in both cases calculated from the date of interruption of the limitation period, as such date is determined pursuant to the provisions of the Swedish Act on Limitations.
