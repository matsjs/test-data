(iii) 3.00:1 from (but excluding) the date falling 36 months from the First Issue Date until (and including) the date falling 42 months of the First Issue Date;
(b) no Event of Default is continuing or would occur upon the incurrence or the payment (as applicable).
13.2 Testing of the Incurrence Test
The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than one month prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness or the making of a Restricted Payment. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt). EBITDA shall be calculated in accordance with Clause 13.3 (Adjustments).
13.3 Adjustments
The figures for EBITDA for the Reference Period ending on the relevant test date shall be used for the Incurrence Test, but adjusted so that:
(a) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Reference Period, or after the end of the Reference Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Reference Period; and
(b) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Reference Period.
