9.1.6
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Noteholders and the Agent upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event. Such notice may be given in advance of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event and be conditional upon the occurrence of such Change of Control Event if a definitive agreement is in place providing for a Change of Control Event.
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Noteholders and the Agent upon publishing a plan for the implementation of a Demerger Event. Such notice must be published no later than on the date that the announcement of the Demerger Event is published in the Finnish Official Gazette (in Finnish: Virallinen Lehti).
When the financial statements and other information are made available to the Noteholders pursuant to Clause 9.1.1, the Issuer shall send copies of such financial statements and other information to the Agent.
The Issuer shall:
(a) together with the financial statements; and
(b) upon the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness (other than as permitted in Clause 10.6.4),
submit to the Agent a compliance certificate in the form of Appendix 1 hereto (i) setting out calculations and figures as to compliance with Clause 10.4 (Financial undertakings) and Clause 10.5 (Incurrence Test), (ii) containing a confirmation that no Event of Default has occurred (or if an Event of Default has occurred, what steps have been taken to remedy it), and (iii) attaching copies of any notices sent to the Relevant Market and/or the Other Market.
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent (with full particulars) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of any of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.
