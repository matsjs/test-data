9. 9.1 9.1.1
The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes. To the extent that the provisions of such laws and regulations conflict with the provisions in this Clause 8.6, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Clause 8.6 by virtue of the conflict.
Any Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to this Clause 8.6 may at the Issuer's discretion be retained, sold or cancelled.
If Notes representing more than seventy-five (75) per cent of the aggregate nominal principal amount of the Notes have been repurchased pursuant to this Clause 8.6, the Issuer is entitled to repurchase all the remaining outstanding Notes at the price stated in Clause 8.6.2 above by notifying the remaining Noteholders of its intention to do so no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the latest possible repurchase date pursuant to Clause 8.6.2. Such prepayment may occur at the earliest on the tenth CSD Business Day following the date of such notice.
Any Noteholder, whether or not it elects to exercise the right to require prepayment in the case of a Demerger Event, is deemed to have waived any and all statutory rights under applicable Finnish law to oppose the Demerger in its capacity as a Noteholder. The Noteholders have by these terms and conditions irrevocably authorised the Issuer to represent them with respect to the Finnish Trade Register in order to withdraw any notices opposing the Demerger.
