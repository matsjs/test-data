Certain jurisdictions do not recognize "second-priority" liens. In such jurisdictions, the Notes and Guarantees will be secured by the first- priority liens granted to the creditors in respect of certain first-priority lien obligations, but the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement will seek to effectively subordinate the secured claims of the Notes and Guarantees on a basis consistent with the second-priority lien provisions described herein and will provide that any recoveries on such liens will be applied to the first- priority-lien obligations before application to the Notes.
The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
(1)
pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any
Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(2)
make loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or
(3)
