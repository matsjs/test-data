Details of such conference calls will either (x) be delivered with each report or (y) posted on an electronic website that is used by the Company to communicate to the equity holders generally for which the Noteholders have been, prior to the posting of such notice, informed of the website address and relevant password specifications, which notice shall constitute reasonable notice of such public calls for the purpose of this paragraph.
In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company has agreed that it will furnish to the holders of the Notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.
