(15) the Refinancing, including but not limited to any Restricted Payment pursuant to or in connection with, the Refinancing;
(16) the payment of any Securitization Fees and purchases of Securitization Assets and related assets pursuant to a Securitization Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing; or
(17) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, other Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $20.0 million since the Issue Date.
The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.
The amount of Equity Interests and Subordinated Shareholder Debt of the Company subscribed directly or indirectly by the Equity Investors in connection with the Refinancing on or before the Issue Date and amounts contributed pursuant to the Shareholder Commitment on or after the Issue Date will be excluded from the calculation of amounts under clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant.
Liens
The Company will not and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, except (1) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral (a) Permitted Liens, or (b) if such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to the extent that all payments due under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable basis (or in the case of Indebtedness which is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantees, prior or senior thereto, with the same relative priority as the Notes or such Guarantee, as applicable, shall have with respect to such subordinated Indebtedness) with the obligations so secured until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien and (2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.
Certain jurisdictions do not recognize "second-priority" liens. In such jurisdictions, the Notes and Guarantees will be secured by the first- priority liens granted to the creditors in respect of certain first-priority lien obligations, but the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement will seek to effectively subordinate the secured claims of the Notes and Guarantees on a basis consistent with the second-priority lien provisions described herein and will provide that any recoveries on such liens will be applied to the first- priority-lien obligations before application to the Notes.
