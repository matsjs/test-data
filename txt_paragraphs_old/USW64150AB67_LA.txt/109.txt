The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental Indenture to the Indenture providing for the guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be pari passu with or senior to such Restricted Subsidiary's guarantee of such other Indebtedness and if such other Indebtedness is secured by a First-Priority Lien, then such Guarantee may have such features as the other Guarantees of the Notes under the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary (1) existing on the Issue Date or (2) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than 250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody's, in connection with the operation of cash management programs established for the benefit of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.
249
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the payment of the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:
(1)
a violation of applicable law, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through
measures reasonably available to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary; or
(2)
any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.
