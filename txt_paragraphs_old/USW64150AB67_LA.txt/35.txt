The Company will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts (or the relevant additional amounts) must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would entitle the Company to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Company publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts (or the relevant additional amounts) by the Company taking reasonable measures available to it.
The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.
Any redemption and notice described above will be subject to the receipt by the Company or any Paying Agent of sufficient funds from the Company to pay the full redemption price payable to the holders of the Notes on or before the Tax Redemption Date.
Mandatory Redemption
The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Repurchase at the Option of Holders
Change o f Control
If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the "Change o f Control Payment"), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
