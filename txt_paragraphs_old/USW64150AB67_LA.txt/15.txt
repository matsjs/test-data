The operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore the Company depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Not all of the Company's Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company's non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Company or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary's creditors, except to the extent that the Company or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Company or such Guarantor. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Structure--The Senior Secured Notes and the Second Lien Notes will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries."
The Guarantees will have the features described above under "--Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees." Upon any distribution to the creditors of a Guarantor in liquidation, administration, bankruptcy moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding up of such Guarantor, the holders of senior secured debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to the Second Lien Note Guarantees. As a result, holders of Second Lien Notes may receive less, rateably, than the holders of senior secured debt of the Guarantors, including the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is
