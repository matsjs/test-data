the product of (a) all dividends, whether paid or accrued and whether or not in cash, on any series of

denominator of which is one minus the then current combined national, state and local statutory tax rate of

"Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio" means, with respect to any specified Person for any period, the ratio of the Consolidated EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Fixed Charges of such Person for such period.
