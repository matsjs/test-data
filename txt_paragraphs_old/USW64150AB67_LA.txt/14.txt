In addition to the foregoing, the Company and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale by the initial purchasers) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (5) above or any combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Guarantee.
The Company or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Company or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If requested by the Trustee, the Company or the Guarantors will provide to the Trustee such information as may be in the possession o f the Company or the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession o f the Trustee) to enable the Trustee to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder, provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or the Guarantors be required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential.
Whenever in the Indenture or in this "Description of the Second Lien Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the payment o f amounts based upon the principal amount o f the Notes or any Guarantee or o f principal, interest or o f any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any o f the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include mention o f the payment o f Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge o f the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Company or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.
The Guarantees
The Notes will be guaranteed by the companies listed under "--Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees-- Guarantees" as of the Issue Date. The Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.
Each of the Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law,

including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or otherwise to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating to capital maintenance and the liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligations under its Guarantee or any security interest, as applicable, could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Notes. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Structure--Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability." and "Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."
