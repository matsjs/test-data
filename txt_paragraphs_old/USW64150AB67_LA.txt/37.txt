deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer's
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the
Company.
The Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of the Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder of Notes' right to require the Company to repurchase such holder's Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.
The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption "--Optional Redemption," unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide and the Mezzanine Facility Agreement provides that the occurrence of a Change of Control would in each case require the repayment of all the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder. If the Company experiences a change of control that triggers a mandatory prepayment under its Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or Mezzanine Facility Agreement, the Company may seek the agreement of the relevant lenders thereunder to maintain the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Mezzanine Facility Agreement or seek to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Mezzanine Facility Agreement. In addition the occurrence of events constituting a Change of Control would trigger the requirement that the Company offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Company from purchasing the Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or require a repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Company to purchase the Notes could cause a
