(20) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (20) not to exceed $40.0 million.
For purposes of determining compliance with this "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant, provided that Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt may not be reclassified. Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt.
The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant.
For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar-Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-U.S. dollar currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollars will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the U.S. Dollar-Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the U.S. Dollar- Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that:
(1)
such U.S. Dollar-Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in
which case the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and
(2)
the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness
