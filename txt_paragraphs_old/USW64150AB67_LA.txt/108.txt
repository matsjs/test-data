(17) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing.
Designation o f Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
The Board of Directors of the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (including any newly acquired or newly formed Restricted Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption "--Restricted Payments" or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption "--Restricted Payments." If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," the Company will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption "-- Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," calculated on a pro form a basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Maintenance o f Listing
The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Company is unable to obtain admission to listing of the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or if at any time the Company determines that it will not so list or maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on another "recognized stock exchange" as defined in §1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.
Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness
The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental Indenture to the Indenture providing for the guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be pari passu with or senior to such Restricted Subsidiary's guarantee of such other Indebtedness and if such other Indebtedness is secured by a First-Priority Lien, then such Guarantee may have such features as the other Guarantees of the Notes under the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement.
Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
