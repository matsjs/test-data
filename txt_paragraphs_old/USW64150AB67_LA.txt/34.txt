such later date); or
any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or
rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change
in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not been publicly announced as
formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of the offering memorandum
(or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this offering
memorandum, such later date) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law").
The Company will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts (or the relevant additional amounts) must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would entitle the Company to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Company publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts (or the relevant additional amounts) by the Company taking reasonable measures available to it.
Absent manifest error, the Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely (without any liability on the part of the Trustee arising from such reliance) on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.
