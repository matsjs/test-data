If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Company in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:
(1)
for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2)
for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3)
for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
