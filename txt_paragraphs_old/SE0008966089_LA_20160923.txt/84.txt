NO DIRECT ACTIONS BY BONDHOLDERS
A Bondholder may not take any steps whatsoever against the Issuer to enforce or recover any amount due or owing to it pursuant to the Finance Documents, or to initiate, support or procure the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (foretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer in relation to any of the liabilities of the Issuer under the Finance Documents.
Clause 21.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Bondholders in accordance with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Bondholder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 19.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance Documents or the Agency Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 19.2.8, such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 19.2.9 before a Bondholder may take any action referred to in Clause 21.1.
The provisions of Clause 21.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Bondholder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 9.5 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event, Delisting Event or a Listing Failure) or other payments which are due by the Issuer to some but not all Bondholders.
