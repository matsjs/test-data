the higher o f the the (i)Market Value and the (it) Transaction Value o f the relevant Vessel(s) the aggregate Market Value o f all the Vessels
In the above calculation of the Redemption Amount, the following principles shall be applied:
(a) the calculation shall be made as per a calculation date determined by the Issuer, falling no earlier than five (5) business days prior to the Issuer giving notice of the relevant Mandatory Prepayment;
(b) the Market Value of the Vessel(s) disposed shall be the most recent Market Value of such Vessel prior to its Permitted Disposal; and
(c) the Market Value of all the Vessels shall be the sum of:
12 (54)
(i) the Market Value of all the Group's Vessels at the time of the calculation, based on valuations dated no earlier than twenty (20) business days prior to the date as of which the Redemption Amount is calculated; and
(ii) the value of the Vessel disposed, as calculated in the numerator of the fraction above.
"Reference Rate" shall mean LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) being the interest rate which (a) is published on Reuters Screen LIBORO1 Page (or through another system or on another website replacing the said system or website respectively) approximately 11.00 a.m. (London time) on the Interest quotation day and for a period comparable to the relevant Interest Period, or, if such publication does not exist, (b) at that time corresponds to (i) the average of the quoted lending rates of commercial banks on the interbank market in New York City or, if only one or no such quotes are provided, (ii) the assessment of the Bond Trustee of the interest rate, which in the opinion of the Bond Trustee and the Issuer is equal to what is offered to commercial banks in the New York city interbank market, for the relevant Interest Period. If any such rate is below zero, LIBOR will be deemed to be zero.
