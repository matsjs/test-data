(a) Security will be given by a Group Company to the extent such company is or becomes a Material Group Company, over such types of assets or asset classes provided as security under the Security or to the extent required to grant security over any shares (ownership interests) in any company becoming a Material Group Company. General statutory and customary limitations (e.g. financial assistance, corporate benefit and retention of title claims) may limit the ability of a Material Group Company to provide security without inclusion of provisions limiting the responsibility for granting full legal valid and perfected security or require that such security is limited by an amount or otherwise.
(c) Group Companies will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if it would
(i) result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference or thin capitalisation laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction;
(ii) result in a significant risk to the officers of the relevant Group Company of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal liability,
unless such guarantees or security documents are accompanied by relevant provisions (limitation language) limiting the potential liability for the relevant Group Company, its management, officers or other employees.
(d) Any assets subject to pre-existing third party arrangements which are permitted by the Finance Documents, RCF Finance Documents or any other contractual restrictions on assignments or absence of necessary regulations, registrations or similar, and which prevent those assets from being charged, will be excluded from any relevant security document but the Material Group Companies must use reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets if the relevant asset is material.
(e) Guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of any joint venture or similar arrangement or any company in which a Material Group Company holds a minority interest.
(f) Perfection of security will not be required if it would materially and adversely affect the ability of the relevant Group Company to conduct its operations or business in the ordinary course.
(g) No notice of receivables security may be given to third party debtors
