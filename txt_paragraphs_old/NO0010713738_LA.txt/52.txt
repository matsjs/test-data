The Issuer may at one occasion, in connection with an Equity Listing Event, repay up to 35.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds (provided at least 65.00% of the aggregate principal amount remains outstanding after such repayment), in which case the relevant amount shall be repaid pro rata as provided for below and the Face Value per Bond be reduced accordingly.
The repayment must occur on an Interest Payment Date within 180 calendar days after such Equity Listing Event and be made with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the cash proceeds received by the Issuer as a result of such Equity Listing Event (net of fees, charges and commissions actually incurred in connection with such offering and net of taxes paid or payable as a result of such offering).
10.4.3
The repayment per Bond shall be at a price equal to the percentage applied for the Call Option for the relevant period applied to the relevant Face Value (such percentage to be equal to the percentage for the first Call Option upon Equity ClawBack before the First Call Date), together with accrued but unpaid interest up to (but not including) the settlement date for the claw-back.
10.5 Make Whole
10.5.1 The Issuer may redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds at any time prior to the First Call Date, at a price equivalent to the sum of:
(a) the present value on the relevant record date of 103.4% of the Face Value as if such payment originally should have taken place on the First Call Date; and
(b) the present value on the relevant record date o f the remaining interest payments (excluding accrued but unpaid interest up to the relevant redemption date) up to and including the First Call Date,
both calculated by using a discount rate equal to the comparable Norwegian Government Rate (i. e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Bonds until the First Call Date) + 0.50%, together with accrued but unpaid interest on the redeemed amount up to (but not including) the relevant redemption date, where the Floating Rate applied shall equal the interpolated NOK mid-swap rate for this period plus the Margin, and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Bond Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Securities Depositary and the Issuer in connection with such repayment.
