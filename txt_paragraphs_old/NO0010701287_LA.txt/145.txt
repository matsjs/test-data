count as the Issuer's Bonds. The Issuer's Bonds shall not have any voting rights.
For this purpose, a Bondholder that has a Bond that is nominee registered shall be
deemed as the Bondholder of such Bond (instead of the nominee) provided that the
Bondholder presents relevant evidence stating that the relevant Bondholder is the
Bondholder of the Bond and the amount of Bonds held by such Bondholder.
(c)
In all matters, the Issuer, the Bond Trustee and any Bondholder have the right to
demand vote by ballot. In case of parity of votes, the chairman shall have the deciding
vote, regardless of the chairman being a Bondholder or not.
