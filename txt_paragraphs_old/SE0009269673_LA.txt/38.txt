The Security Agent may at any time, acting on instructions of the Working Capital Facility Provider and the Trustee (acting on behalf of the Bondholders), release Transaction Security and the Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Guarantee Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt any Transaction Security or Guarantees will always be released pro rata between the Bondholders and the Working Capital Facility Provider and the remaining Transaction Security will continue to rank pari passu between the Bondholders and the Working Capital Facility Provider as set forth in the Security Documents, the Guarantee Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement.
(a) The Trustee may only take any action to accelerate or enforce any Transaction Security or Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement contains a stand-still provision (binding upon the Secured Creditors) relating to the enforcement of the Transaction Security and the Guarantees.
(b) Upon an enforcement of the Transaction Security and/or the Guarantees, the proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
(c) All security and/or guarantees or arrangement having similar effects may be released by the Security Agent, without the need for any further referral to or authority from anyone, upon any enforcement provided that the proceeds are distributed in accordance with the provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
