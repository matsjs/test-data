arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Holder, including the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw. foretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer. By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Holder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Tmstee to act on its behalf.
Each Holder shall immediately upon request by the Trustee provide the Tmstee with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Tmstee), as the Tmstee deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Tmstee is under no obligation to represent a Holder which does not comply with such request.
The Issuer shall promptly upon request provide the Tmstee with any documents and other assistance (in form and substance satisfactory to the Tmstee), that the Tmstee deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents.
The Tmstee is entitled to fees for its work and to be indemnified for costs, losses and liabilities on the terms set out in the Finance Documents, and the Tmstee's obligations as tmstee and security agent under the Finance Documents are conditioned upon the due payment of such fees and indemnifications.
The Tmstee may act as tmstee and/or security agent for several issues of securities issued by or relating to the Issuer and other Group Companies notwithstanding potential conflicts of interest.
