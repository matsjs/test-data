16.7 The Company is only obligated to inform the Bond Trustee according to Section 16.6 if informing the Bond Trustee would not conflict with any statute or, when the Bonds have been listed, the Company's registration contract with OMX. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with OMX or otherwise, the Company shall however be obligated to either seek the approval from OMX or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Bond Trustee, in order to be able to timely inform the Bond Trustee according to Section 16.6.
16.9 If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Bond Trustee or the Company, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Section 18, the Bond Trustee shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Bond Trustee is however not liable to take action if the Bond Trustee considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Bond Trustee harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Bond Trustee in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
16.10 If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Section 16, the Bond Trustee shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
16.11 For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Section 16 without relevant decision by the Bond Trustee or the Holders pursuant to Section 18.
