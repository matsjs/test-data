"Market Adjusted Total Assets " means, on any date, (i) the Total Assets of the Issuer (on an unconsolidated basis), adjusted for any Excess Value or (ii) the Net Asset Value (as applicable in relation to an Adjusted Calculation only) plus the Issuer's Financial Indebtedness as the relevant testing date plus the outstanding amount of any Financial Indebtedness of another company guaranteed by the Issuer or any other Holding Company and/or secured with share pledge over (a) the Issuer's or (b) a Holding Company's directly owned shares in the relevant Group Company (without any double counting).
(i) In respect of shares in Advanzia, an amount calculated based on a "Price/Earnings" multiple of 12.00x for the last twelve months at the end of the relevant interim period (i.e. the net profit after taxes for Advanzia on a consolidated basis for the last twelve months multiplied with a factor of 12.00). As Advanzia is reporting in EUR, the NOK equivalent amount shall equal the average EURNOK exchange rate for the previous twelve months (as per Norges Bank fixings) at the end of the relevant interim period. The net earnings being used shall be adjusted for any one-off accounting effects resulting from changes related to implementation of IFRS9 or similar changes in accounting principles; and
(ii) In respect of shares in VSS, the Issuer's book value of such shares adjusted for the difference between the book value and the market value (positive or negative) of the vessels owned by VSS (the "Vessels") in NOK, determined as the arithmetic mean of two independent valuations of the Vessels obtained from independent and well-reputed sale and purchase brokers familiar with the market for the Vessels, appointed by the Issuer and approved by the Trustee. Such valuation shall be made on the basis of a sale for prompt delivery for cash at arm's length on normal commercial terms as between a willing seller and willing buyer, on an "as is where is" basis, free of any existing charters or other contracts for employment. The cost of such determination shall be for the account of the Issuer twice per year. The valuation shall be made at least semi annually, or following an Event of Default (as defined below), upon the request of the Trustee; and

(iii) In respect of any other shares listed on a regulated market from time to time, the volume weighted average price for such shares over the preceding 20 Business Days.
"Net Asset Value" means the aggregate value of the Issuer's assets less the value of the Issuer's Financial Indebtedness as of the relevant testing date, and adjusted further by deducting the outstanding amount of any Financial Indebtedness of another company guaranteed by the Issuer or any Holding Company and/or secured with share pledge over (a) the Issuer's, or (b) a Holding Company's directly owned shares in the relevant Group Company (without any double counting), to be calculated by two independent financial advisers appointed by the Issuer (one of the financial advisors to be approved by the Trustee in the Trustee's sole discretion). If the two independent financial advisers disagree as to the Net Asset Value, the average of the two calculations shall apply.
"Total Assets" means the aggregate book value of an entity's (on a unconsolidated or consolidated basis as the case may be) total assets treated as assets in accordance with GAAP, as illustrated in the then most recent Financial Statements or SemiAnnually Financial Report (as the case may be) of such entity.
