The financial covenant set out in Clauses 13.5.1 to 13.5.3 will apply at all times and shall be tested on a semi-annual basis, to be calculated on 30 June and 31 December each year and reported in connection with the corresponding Financial Statements and Semi-Annually Financial Reports, cf. Clause 13.2.1(c) and (d).
(i) In the event of non-compliance by the Issuer of the financial covenants relating to Market Adjusted Equity Ratio and/or Market Adjusted Equity, the Issuer shall have the right to request a retesting of the financial covenant(s) to which the non-compliance relates, such retesting to be calculated by two independent financial advisers appointed by the Issuer (one of the financial advisors to be approved by the Trustee in the Tmstee's sole discretion) by reference to the Net Asset Value (the "Adjusted Calculation") (the average of the result of such retesting by the two independent financial advisers to be applied). The results of such calculation shall be provided to the Bond Trustee no later than two
22
months (with the Bond Trustee having the authority to approve an extension if necessary to allow the independent financial advisers to carry out the calculation) after the relevant original testing date of the relevant financial covenants.
(ii) In the event that one of the financial advisors appointed by the Issuer in relation to an Adjusted Calculation is not approved by the Trustee (as per the above Clause 13.5.5(i)), provided that the Issuer shall have multiple attempts in doing so, the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) is authorized to and may in in its sole discretion appoint the financial advisor.
(iii) If the Issuer is in compliance with the relevant financial covenants based on the Adjusted Calculation, and reported by the Issuer to the Bond Trustee within two months after the testing date to which the non-compliance relates, then no default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a consequence of such financial covenant non-compliance occurring prior to performing the Adjusted Calculation.
(iv) If at any time compliance with the financial covenants have been based on an Adjusted Calculation, then each subsequent testing of the financial covenants (to be tested on a semi-annual basis, and to be calculated on 30 June and 31 December each year and reported in connection with the corresponding SemiAnnually Financial Reports and Financial Statements) shall always be based on an Adjusted Calculation, and the Issuer shall instruct the Bond Trustee to inform the Bondholders that any future testing of the financial covenants will be based on an Adjusted Calculation. The Issuer shall ensure that such reports are submitted to and received by the Bond Trustee.
13.5.6 Potential change in accounting principles
To the extent that the Issuer elects or is required to conform its periodical financial reports with the requirements of the IAS/IFRS regulations and such guidelines and standards as shall be recommended from time to time by the International Accounting Standards Board, or if there have been made any material changes to GAAP or the interpretation of such accounting principles, the Issuer and the Trustee will conduct a review of the impact thereof on the Issuer's consolidated and unconsolidated Financial Statements. Amendments shall be made to the financial covenants (if necessary) in order to enable the Trustee to apply thereunder the same financial tests as set forth above under Clauses 13.5.1, 13.5.2 and 13.5.3 as the Trustee would have been able to do had the Issuer continued to prepare its consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with otherwise applicable Norwegian accounting principles. The Trustee may ask any well reputed accountancy firm or investment bank to assist in the determination and may rely solely on such determination without a duty to examine the merits of the determination.
