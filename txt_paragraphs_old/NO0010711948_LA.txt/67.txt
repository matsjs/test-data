(f) Arm's length transactions
The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall ensure that no other Group Company shall, engage, directly or indirectly, in any transaction with any party (without limitation, the purchase, sale or exchange of assets or the rendering of any service), except in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to the reasonable requirement of the Issuer's business or such member of the Group's business and upon terms that are not less favorable to the Issuer or such member of the Group (as the case may be), than those which might be obtained in an arm's length transaction at the time.
