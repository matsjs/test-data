(b) making payment to the relevant Bondholder of an amount (the "Cash Settlement Amount") equal to the amount (if any) by which the principal aggregate amount of such Bonds exceeds the product of the Current Value of a Share on the Valuation Date and the whole number of Shares deliverable to such Bondholder in accordance with (a) above; and
