THE AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND UNDERTAKING TO MAKE PAYMENTS
The Issuer may choose not to issue the full amount of Bonds on the Issue Date and may in such case, provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, choose to issue the remaining amount of Bonds at one or more subsequent dates ("Subsequent Bond Issue"). The price of Bonds issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue may be set at the Nominal Amount or at a higher or lower amount than the Nominal Amount. Bonds issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue shall have the same ISIN, Interest Rate, Nominal Amount, Final Maturity Date and other rights as Bonds issued on the Issue Date.
The Issuer undertakes to repay the Bonds, to pay Interest and to otherwise act in accordance and comply with these Terms and Conditions.
The Bonds are denominated in EUR and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to these Terms and Conditions and by acquiring Bonds each subsequent Holder confirms such agreements.
STATUS OF THE BONDS
The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them.
