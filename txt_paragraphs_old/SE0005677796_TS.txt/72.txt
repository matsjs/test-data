22.2 Clause 22.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance with these Terms and Conditions to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 20.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under these Terms and Conditions or the Agent Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 20.2.9, such failure must continue for at least 40 Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 20.2.10 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Clause 22.1.
23. TIME-BAR
23.1 The right to receive repayment of the principal of the Bonds shall be prescribed and become void 10 years from the Redemption Date. The right to receive payment of Interest (excluding any capitalised Interest) shall be prescribed and become void 3 years from the relevant due date for payment. The Issuer is entitled to any funds set aside for payments in respect of which the Holders' right to receive payment has been prescribed and has become void.
