Any such notice shall be deemed to have been received by the Noteholders when published in any manner specified in this Clause 21.2.1.
In addition to Clause 21.2.1, if any information relating to the Notes or the Issuer contained in a notice the Agent may send to the Noteholders under these Terms and Conditions has not already been made public in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, the Agent shall before it sends such information to the Noteholders give the Issuer the opportunity to make public such information in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. If the Issuer does not promptly make public such information and the Agent considers it necessary to make such information public in accordance with Clause 21.2.1 before it can lawfully send a notice containing such information to the Noteholders, the Agent shall be entitled to do so.
FORCE MAJEURE AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Neither the Issuer, the Agent nor the Issuing Agent shall be held responsible for any damage arising out of any legal enactment, or any measure taken by a public authority, or war, strike, lockout, boycott, blockade or any other similar circumstance (a "Force Majeure Event"). The reservation in respect of strikes, lockouts, boycotts and blockades applies even if the Agent or the Issuing Agent itself takes such measures, or is subject to such measures.
The Issuing Agent shall have no liability to the Noteholders if it has observed reasonable care. The Issuing Agent shall never be responsible for indirect damage with exception of gross negligence and wilful misconduct.
Should a Force Majeure Event arise which prevents the Issuer, the Agent or the Issuing Agent from taking any action required to comply with these Terms and Conditions, such action may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed.
