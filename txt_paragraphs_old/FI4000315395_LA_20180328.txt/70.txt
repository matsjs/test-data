(e) a mandatory exchange of the Notes for other securities; and
(f) early redemption of the Notes, other than upon an acceleration of the Notes pursuant to Clause 11 (Acceleration o f the Notes) or as otherwise permitted or required by these Terms and Conditions.
Any matter not covered by Clause 14.5 shall require the consent of Noteholders representing more than 50 per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Noteholders are voting at a Noteholders' Meeting or for which Noteholders reply in a Written Procedure in accordance with the instructions given pursuant to Clause 16.3. This includes, but is not limited to, any amendment to, or waiver of, these Terms and Conditions that does not require a higher majority (other than an amendment permitted pursuant to Clause 17.1(a) or (b)), an acceleration of the Notes.
Quorum at a Noteholders' Meeting or in respect of a Written Procedure only exists if a Noteholder (or Noteholders) representing at least fifty (50) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount in case of a matter pursuant to Clause 14.5, and otherwise twenty (20) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount:
(a) if at a Noteholders' Meeting, attend the meeting in person (or appear through duly authorised representatives); or
(b) if in respect of a Written Procedure, reply to the request.
If a quorum does not exist at a Noteholders' Meeting or in respect of a Written Procedure, the Agent or the Issuer shall convene a second Noteholders' Meeting (in accordance with Clause 15.1) or initiate a second Written Procedure (in accordance with Clause 16.1), as the case may be, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Person(s) who initiated the procedure for Noteholders' consent. The quorum requirement in Clause 14.7 shall not apply to such second Noteholders' Meeting or Written Procedure.
