THE BONDS
2.1 Amount, denomination and ISIN of the Bonds
(a) The Issuer has resolved to issue a series of Bonds in the maximum amount of USD 250,000,000 (the "Maximum Issue Amount"). The Bonds may be issued on different issue dates and the Initial Bond Issue will be in the amount of up to USD 200,000,000. The Issuer may, provided that the conditions set out in Clause 6.2 (Tap Issues) are met, at one or more occasions up until, but excluding, the Maturity Date or any earlier date when the Bonds have been redeemed in full (a "Tap Issue Date") issue Additional Bonds (each a "Tap Issue") until the aggregate Initial Nominal Amount of the Outstanding Bonds equals the Maximum Issue Amount (less the aggregate Initial Nominal Amount of any previously redeemed Bonds). Each Tap Issue will be subject to identical terms as the Bonds issued pursuant to the Initial Bond Issue in all respects as set out in these Bond Terms, except that Additional Bonds may be issued at a different price than for the Initial Bond Issue and which may be below or above the Nominal Amount. For Tap Issues not falling on an Interest Payment Date, accrued interest will be calculated using standard market practice in the secondary bond market. The Bond Trustee shall prepare an addendum to these Bond Terms evidencing the terms of each Tap Issue (a "Tap Issue Addendum").
(b) The Bonds are denominated in US Dollars (USD), being the legal currency of the United States of America.
(c) The Initial Nominal Amount of each Bond is USD 1.00.
