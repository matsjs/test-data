(g) Each of the Agent and the Security Agent is entitled to engage external experts when carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Issuer shall on demand by the Agent and/or the Security Agent (as applicable) pay all costs for external experts engaged after the occurrence of an Event of Default, or for the purpose of investigating or considering (i) an event which the Agent reasonably believes is or may lead to an Event of Default or (ii) a matter relating to the Issuer or the Transaction Security which the Agent reasonably believes may be detrimental to the interests of the Bondholders under the
Finance Documents. Any compensation for damages or other recoveries received by the Agent and/or the Security Agent (as applicable) from external experts engaged by it for the purpose of carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents shall be distributed in accordance with Clause 15 (Distribution of Proceeds).
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Finance Documents to the contrary, neither the Agent nor the Security Agent is obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or regulation.
(i) If in the Agent's or the Security Agent's reasonable opinion the cost, loss or liability which it may incur (including its respective reasonable fees) in complying with instructions of the Bondholders, or taking any action at its own initiative, will not be covered by the Issuer, the Agent or the Security Agent (as applicable) may refrain from acting in accordance with such instructions, or taking such action, until it has received such funding or indemnities (or adequate Security has been provided therefore) as it may reasonably require.
(j) Each of the Agent and the Security Agent shall give a notice to the Bondholders (i) before it ceases to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents by reason of the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance Documents or the Agency Agreement or (ii) if it refrains from acting for any reason described in Clause 20.2(i).
20.3 Limited liability for the Agent and the Security Agent
(a) Neither the Agent nor the Security Agent will be liable to the Bondholders for damage or loss caused by any action taken or omitted by it under or in connection with any Finance Document, unless directly caused by its negligence or willful misconduct or unless otherwise provided for in the Act on Noteholders' Agent. Neither the Agent nor the Security Agent shall be responsible for indirect loss.
(b) Neither the Agent nor the Security Agent shall be considered to have acted negligently if it has acted in accordance with advice from or opinions of reputable external experts addressed to it or if it has acted with reasonable care in a situation when it considers that it is detrimental to the interests of the Bondholders to delay the action in order to first obtain instructions from the Bondholders.
(c) Neither the Agent nor the Security Agent shall be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents to be paid by it to the Bondholders, provided that it has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by it for that purpose.
