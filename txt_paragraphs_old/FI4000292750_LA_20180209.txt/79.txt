(a) Subject to Clause 20.4(f), each of the Agent and the Security Agent may resign by giving notice to the Issuer and the Bondholders, in which case the Bondholders shall appoint a successor Agent and/or Security Agent (as applicable) at a Bondholders' Meeting convened by the retiring Agent and/or retiring Security Agent (as applicable) or by way of Written Procedure initiated by the retiring Agent.
(c) A Bondholder (or Bondholders) representing at least ten (10) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount may, by notice to the Issuer (such notice may only be validly given by a Person who is a Bondholder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the notice is received by the Issuer and shall, if given by several Bondholders, be given by them jointly), require that a Bondholders' Meeting is held for the purpose of dismissing the Agent and/or the Security Agent and appointing a new Agent and/or a new Security Agent (as applicable). The Issuer may, at a Bondholders' Meeting convened by it or by way of Written Procedure initiated by it, propose to the Bondholders that the Agent and/or Security Agent (as applicable) be dismissed and a new Agent and/or a new Security Agent (as applicable) be appointed.
(d) If the Bondholders have not appointed a successor Agent and/or successor Security Agent (as applicable) within ninety (90) days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Agent was dismissed through a decision by the Bondholders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Agent and/or successor Security Agent (as applicable) which shall be an independent financial institution or an independent

reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances and which is registered (if required to be so registered by the Act on Noteholders' Agent) in the public register of noteholders' agents referred to in the Act on Noteholders' Agent.
(e) The retiring Agent and/or retiring Security Agent (as applicable) shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent and/or successor Security Agent (as applicable) such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent and/or successor Security Agent (as applicable) may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent and/or Security Agent (as applicable) under the Finance Documents.
(f) The Agent's and the Security Agent's resignation or dismissal shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor Agent and/or successor Security Agent (as applicable) and acceptance by such successor Agent and/or successor Security Agent (as applicable) of such appointment and the execution of all necessary documentation to effectively substitute the retiring Agent and/or retiring Security Agent (as applicable).
(g) Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent and/or the retiring Security Agent (as applicable) shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Agent and/or as Security Agent (as applicable).

(h) In the event that there is a change of the Agent and/or the Security Agent in accordance with this Clause 20.4, the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Agent and/or the new Security Agent (as applicable) may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new Agent and/or new Security Agent (as applicable) the rights, powers and obligation of the Agent and/or the Security Agent (as applicable) and releasing the retiring Agent and/or the retiring Security Agent (as applicable) from its respective further obligations under the Finance Documents and the Agency Agreement. Unless the Issuer and the new Agent and/or the New Security Agent (as applicable) agrees otherwise, the new Agent and/or the New Security Agent (as applicable) shall be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Agent and/or the retiring Security Agent (as applicable).
