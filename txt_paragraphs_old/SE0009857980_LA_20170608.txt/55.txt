13.5 Adjustments to Net Finance Charges

(a) reduced by an amount equal to the Net Finance Charges directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer or of any other Group Company repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to the Issuer and the continuing Group Companies with the proceeds from disposals of entities referred to in Clause 13.4 (or, if the Financial Indebtedness is owed by a Group Company that is sold, the Net Interest Payable for such period directly attributable to the Financial Indebtedness of such Group Company to the extent the Issuer and the continuing Group Companies are no longer liable for such Financial Indebtedness after such sale);
(b) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Net Finance Charges directly attributable to:
(i) any Financial Indebtedness owed by acquired entities or business referred to in Clause 13.4 if the acquired debt is to be tested under the Incurrence Test pursuant to paragraph (m) of the definition of "Permitted Debt", and
(ii) any Financial Indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of such entities, in each case calculated as if all such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant test period; and
(c) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Net Finance Charges directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness permitted pursuant to paragraph (g) of the definition of "Permitted Debt", calculated as if such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant test period.
