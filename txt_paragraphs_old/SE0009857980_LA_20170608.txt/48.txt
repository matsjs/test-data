11. Priority of the Super Senior RCF
(a) Payment block
Following a Payment Block Event and for as long as it is continuing, no payments may be made by the Issuer to the Bondholders under or in relation to the Bonds (notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary herein). For the avoidance of doubt, the failure by the Issuer to timely make any payments due under the Bonds shall constitute an Event of Default and the unpaid amount shall carry default interest pursuant to Clause 8(d).
(b) Priority of the Super Senior RCF in case of insolvency
In the case of insolvency of the Issuer, the Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer under the Bonds will be subordinated to the Financial Indebtedness owed by the Issuer under the Super Senior RCF and the Super Senior Hedges.
(c) Priority of the Super Senior RCF with respect to Shared Security
In case of enforcement of the Shared Security, any enforcement proceeds will first be applied towards repayment of the Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer under the Super Senior RCF and the Super Senior Hedges and secondly towards redemption of the Bonds.
(d) Consultation period before enforcement of Shared Security
If Conflicting Enforcement Instructions (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are provided by the Agent or the agent under the Super Senior RCF, the Agent and the agent under the Super Senior RCF must enter into consultations for a period of maximum 30 calendar days as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (unless such consultation is waived by the Agent and the facility agent under the Super Senior RCF).
