(c) Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360-days basis).
(e) Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, following the occurrence of a Payment Block Event and for as long as it is continuing, no payment of principal or interest in respect of the Bonds shall be made to the Bondholders. However, interest shall continue to accrue during such period and any overdue amounts shall carry default interest pursuant to Clause 8(d). For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to repay principal or pay interest on a due date shall constitute an Event of Default.
9. Redemption and Repurchase of the Bonds
9.1 Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds in full on the Final Maturity Date with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. If the Final Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then the redemption shall occur on the first following Business Day.
9.2 Issuer's purchase of Bonds
The Issuer may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds on the market or in any other way. The Bonds held by the Issuer pursuant to this Clause 9.2 may at the Issuer's discretion be retained or sold but may not be cancelled by the Issuer.
