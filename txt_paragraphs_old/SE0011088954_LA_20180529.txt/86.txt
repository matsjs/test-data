However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under these Terms and Conditions or the Agent Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 20.2.12, such failure must continue for at least 40 Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 20.2.13 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Clause 23.1.
