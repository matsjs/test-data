is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon expiry of such notice and the fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Notes in full at the applicable amounts.
Mandatory partial redemption
The Issuer shall ensure that, upon a Permitted Partial Divestment, an amount at least equal to 100 per cent. of the Existing Financial Indebtedness of the Restricted Company which shares are being disposed of (the "Prepayment Amount") is transferred to the Deposit Account. When the Prepayment Amount has been transferred to the Deposit Account, the Agent shall release the Security over the shares in the divested Restricted Company. The Prepayment Amount shall remain on the Deposit Account until the Agent instructs the Account Bank to transfer such amount for the purpose of partial prepayment of the Notes in accordance with this Clause 10.5.
The Agent and the Issuer shall ensure that the Prepayment Amount is used to partially prepay the Notes by applying the Prepayment Amount towards reduction of the Nominal Amount of each Note pro rata at a price equal to the redemption amount specified in Clause 10.4 (Voluntary total redemption (call option)), as applicable considering when the disposal is made.
