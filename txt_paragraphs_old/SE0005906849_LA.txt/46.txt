REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF THE NOTES
On the Interest Payment Date occurring on 25 April each year (with the first scheduled redemption occurring on 25 April 2015) (the "Scheduled Redemption Dates") the Issuer shall redeem SEK 50,000,000 of the Total Nominal Amount (the "Annual Redemption Amount").
The Issuer shall ensure that each Annual Redemption Amount is used to partially prepay the Notes by applying the Annual Redemption Amount towards reduction of the Nominal Amount of each Note pro rata at a price equal to 100 per cent. of the Nominal Amount.
The amount to be redeemed on each Scheduled Redemption Date shall be rounded down to the nearest SEK 1,000 per Note.
Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes in full on the Final Maturity Date with an amount per Note equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. If the Final Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then the redemption shall occur on the first following Business Day.
Group Companies' purchase of Notes
Each Group Company may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Notes on the market or in any other way. Notes held by a Group Company may at such Group Company's discretion be retained, sold, or if held by the Issuer, cancelled.
