i. 100.00 per cent, of the Nominal Amount, plus
both sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) discounted (for the time period starting from the relevant Redemption Date to the Final Maturity Date) using a discount rate equal to the yield to maturity on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the applicable notice of redemption is given of the Swedish Bond Rate with a maturity date on or about
the Final Maturity Date plus 0.50 per cent; minus
iii. the Nominal Amount.
For the purpose of calculating the Applicable Premium, the "Swedish Bond Rate" means the direct obligations of Sweden (statsobligationer) with a fixed maturity most nearly equal to the period from the Redemption Date to the Final Maturity Date, provided that:
(a) if the period from the Redemption Date to the Final Maturity Date is not equal to the fixed maturity of a direct obligation of Sweden for which a yield is given, the Swedish Bond Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation from the yields of direct obligations of Sweden for which such yields are given; and
(b) if the period from the Redemption Date to the Final Maturity Date is less than one (1) year, the yield on actually traded direct obligations of Sweden adjusted to a fixed maturity of one year shall be used.
The Applicable Premium shall be calculated and determined by the Issuing Agent.
"Bond" means a debt instrument (skuldförbindelse) for the Nominal Amount and of the type set forth in Chapter 1 Section 3 of the Financial Instruments Accounts Act and which are governed by and issued under these Terms and Conditions, including the Initial Bonds and any Subsequent Bonds.
