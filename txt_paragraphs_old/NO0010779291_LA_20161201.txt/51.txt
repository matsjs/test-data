months (with the Bond Trustee having the authority to approve an extension if necessary to allow the independent financial advisers to carry out the calculation) after the relevant original testing date of the relevant financial covenants.
(iii) If the Issuer is in compliance with the relevant financial covenants based on the Adjusted Calculation, and reported by the Issuer to the Bond Trustee within two months after the testing date to which the non-compliance relates, then no default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a consequence of such financial covenant non-compliance occurring prior to performing the Adjusted Calculation.
(iv) If at any time compliance with the financial covenants have been based on an Adjusted Calculation, then each subsequent testing of the financial covenants (to be tested on a semi-annual basis, and to be calculated on 30 June and 31 December each year and reported in connection with the corresponding Semi Annually Financial Reports and Financial Statements) shall always be based on an Adjusted Calculation, and the Issuer shall instruct the Bond Trustee to inform the Bondholders that any future testing of the financial covenants will be based on an Adjusted Calculation. The Issuer shall ensure that such reports are submitted to and received by the Bond Trustee.
13.5.6 Potential change in accounting principles
To the extent that the Issuer elects or is required to conform its periodical financial reports with the requirements of the IAS/IFRS regulations and such guidelines and standards as shall be recommended from time to time by the International Accounting Standards Board, or if there have been made any material changes to GAAP or the interpretation of such accounting principles, the Issuer and the Trustee will conduct a review of the impact thereof on the Issuer's consolidated and unconsolidated Financial Statements. Amendments shall be made to the financial covenants (if necessary) in order to enable the Trustee to apply thereunder the same financial tests as set forth above under Clauses 13.5.1, 13.5.2 and 13.5.3 as the Trustee would have been able to do had the Issuer continued to prepare its consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with otherwise applicable Norwegian accounting principles. The Trustee may ask any well reputed accountancy firm or investment bank to assist in the determination and may rely solely on such determination without a duty to examine the merits of the determination.
