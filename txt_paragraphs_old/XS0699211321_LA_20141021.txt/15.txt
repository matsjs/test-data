(i) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Note at November 1, 2014 (such redemption price (expressed in percentage of principal amount) being set forth in the table above under the first paragraph of this section (excluding accrued and unpaid interest)), plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such Note to and including November 1,2014 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the Swedish Government Bond Rate at such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over
(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Note,
as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate. For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the Trustee or Paying Agents.

available at least two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Issuer in good faith)) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to November 1, 2014; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to November 1,2014 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Kingdom of Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office for which a weekly average yield is given, the Swedish Government Bond Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Kingdom of Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office, for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to November 1,2014 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Kingdom of Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
