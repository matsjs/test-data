(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase or commit to invest in or purchase Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt
of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;
(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or
(d) any combination of the foregoing,
provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.
Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute ``Excess Proceeds''. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds SEK 250 million, the Issuer will be required within ten (10) Business Days thereof to make an offer (``Asset Disposition Offer'') to all holders of Notes and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured in whole or in part by a Lien on the Collateral which Lien ranks pari passu with the Liens securing the Notes, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of SEK 1,000,000 and in integral multiples of SEK 1,000 in excess thereof.
To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in SEK, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their SEK Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.
The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the ``Asset Disposition Offer Period''). No later than five (5) Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the ``Asset Disposition Purchase Date''), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the ``Asset Disposition
