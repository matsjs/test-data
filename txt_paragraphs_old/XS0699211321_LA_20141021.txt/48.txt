financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of HoldCo, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) description of the business, management and shareholders of HoldCo, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments (to the extent not previously reported pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below);
(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction, or any change in a senior executive officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer (or HoldCo), or any other material event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.
All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may (i) in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods and (ii) to the extent comparable prior year period financial information of HoldCo does not exist, the comparable prior year period financial information of the Company may be provided in lieu thereof. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum and in no event shall U.S. GAAP information or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP be required.
At any time that any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by the first two clauses of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of HoldCo and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of HoldCo and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenue, EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.
Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in (1), (2) and (3) above, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the Issuer or HoldCo in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer or HoldCo determines in good faith that such reports cannot be made available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon their
195
request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the offices of the Listing Agent in Luxembourg or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). In the event that (i) the Issuer or HoldCo becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13 (a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer or HoldCo elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer or HoldCo) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP or IFRS information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or HoldCo is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding four paragraphs.
In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.
