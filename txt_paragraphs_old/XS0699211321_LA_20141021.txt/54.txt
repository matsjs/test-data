If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ``Suspension Event''), then, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of these events and beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the ``Reversion Date''), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes: ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'', ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', ``-- Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries'', ``-- Limitation on Affiliate Transactions'', ``-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'', the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Merger and Consolidation'' and ``-- Impairment of Security Interests'' and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'' covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Issuer's option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that
it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness''.
Impairment of Security Interests
The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents and/or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that, except with respect to any discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.
Additional Intercreditor Agreements
The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' or clause (1), (4)(a) and (b), (6), (7) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ``Additional Intercreditor Agreement'') or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under ``Amendments and Waivers'', and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments''.
