The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under ``Description of Notes-- Withholding Taxes.'' If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under ``Description of Notes-- Withholding Taxes,'' the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes
or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.
Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee and the agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective agents have or will have any responsibility or liability for:
· any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;
· Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or
· the records of the common depositary.
Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants.
