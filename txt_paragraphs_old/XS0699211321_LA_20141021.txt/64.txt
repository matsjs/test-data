(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);
(3) an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and
(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

Satisfaction and Discharge
The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or an entity designated by it for this purpose), money or SEK-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the ``Satisfaction and Discharge'' section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
