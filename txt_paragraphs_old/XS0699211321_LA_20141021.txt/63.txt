In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.
Defeasance
The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture (``legal defeasance'') and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).
The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under the covenants described under ``-- Certain Covenants'' (other than clauses (1) and (2) of ``--Certain Covenants-- Merger and Consolidation'') and ``Change of Control'' and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under ``Events of Default'' above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross-acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under ``Events of Default'' above (``covenant defeasance'').
The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Merger and Consolidation''), (4), (5), (6) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries), (7), (8) or (9) under ``Events of Default'' above.
In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the ``defeasance trust'') with the Trustee (or an entity designated by it for this purpose) cash in SEK or SEK-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:
(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);
(2) an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;
