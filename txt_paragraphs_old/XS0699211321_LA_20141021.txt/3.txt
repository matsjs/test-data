 be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;
 rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;
 benefit from the security as set forth below under ``-- Security''; and
 be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by liens on property or assets that do not secure that Guarantor's guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness.
The obligations of a Guarantor incorporated in Sweden under its Guarantee of the Notes and the security provided as security for the obligations under the Notes by a company incorporated in Sweden will be limited if required by an application of the provisions of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen) regulating transfers of values (Sw. vardeOverforingar). The liability of each such Guarantor in respect of such obligations will only apply to the extent permitted by such provisions of the Swedish Companies Act.
Further, the obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or capital maintenance regulations. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--The Notes Guarantees and security interest will be subject to certain

limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability''.
