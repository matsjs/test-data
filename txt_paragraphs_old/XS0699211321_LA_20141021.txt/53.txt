(1) HoldCo will not engage in any business activity, except any such activity (i) reasonably relating to the offering, sale, issuance, incurrence and servicing, purchase, redemption, amendment, exchange, refinancing or retirement of or investment in the Notes, the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or other Indebtedness permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Parent; (ii) undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling any other obligations under the Notes, the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, any additional notes in respect of both of the foregoing, the Indenture, the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, the Guarantees (including guarantees in respect of the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Senior Secured Credit Facilities), the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Hedging Obligations, other Indebtedness or any other obligations permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, any Security Document to which it is a party or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any additional intercreditor agreement entered into pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture); (iii) involving the provision of administrative services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the receipt of any amounts related thereto to the extent permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of HoldCo's corporate existence, the acquisition, holding or disposition of assets permitted to be held by it under the Indenture and the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof or reasonably related to its function as an intermediate holding company; or (v) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are immaterial in nature.

Additional Guarantors
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer shall ensure that within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer that the Consolidated EBITDA (determined separately and without double counting) for such fiscal year of each of the Issuer and the Guarantors shall be equal to or exceed the lesser of (i) 75% of Consolidated EBITDA and (ii) 75% of EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the Issue Date, and if such definition is no longer used or applicable under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, then only clause (i) shall apply) for such ended fiscal year of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries by causing one or more of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to become Guarantors to the extent necessary to ensure the foregoing threshold is met. A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Notes on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. For purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA for any such period, any acquisitions (including through mergers or consolidations) or dispositions that were made or occurred during such period shall be given pro forma effect as if such acquisition or disposition occurred at the beginning of such period Any such pro forma calculations shall be made in a manner consistent with other pro forma calculations made pursuant to the Indenture.
Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a breach or violation of statutory limitations, rules regarding corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization, capital maintenance, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary or any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership), and any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any obligation under the Guarantee itself) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.
Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status
If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ``Suspension Event''), then, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of these events and beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the ``Reversion Date''), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes: ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'', ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', ``-- Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries'', ``-- Limitation on Affiliate Transactions'', ``-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'', the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Merger and Consolidation'' and ``-- Impairment of Security Interests'' and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'' covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Issuer's option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that
