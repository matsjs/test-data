(1) since the beginning of such period the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has disposed of any company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business or otherwise ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (and is not a Restricted Subsidiary at the end of such period) (any such disposition, a ``Sale" ) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is such a Sale, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable thereto for such period; provided that if any such sale constitutes ``discontinued operations" in accordance with IFRS, Consolidated Net Income shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if positive) attributable to such operations for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if negative) attributable thereto for such period;
(3) since the beginning of such period, any Person (that became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) will have made any Sale or any Purchase that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above if made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Sale or Purchase occurred on the first day of such period.
For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Income Taxes, Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer or an Officer of the Issuer or HoldCo (including in respect of anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies) and (b) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on any date of determination, pro forma effect shall be given to any Incurrence, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period.
``Consolidated Net Income'' means, for any period, the net income (loss) of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis on the basis of IFRS; provided, however, that there will not be included in such Consolidated Net Income:
(1) subject to the limitations contained in clause (3) below, any net income (loss) of any Person if such Person is not a Restricted Subsidiary, except that the Issuer's equity in the net income of any such Person for such period will be included in such Consolidated Net Income up to the aggregate amount of cash or Cash Equivalents actually distributed by such Person during such period to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary as a dividend or other distribution or return on investment (subject,

in the case of a dividend or other distribution or return on investment to a Restricted Subsidiary, to the limitations contained in clause (2) below);
(2) solely for the purpose of determining the amount available for Restricted Payments under clause (c)(i) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'', any net income (loss) of any Restricted Subsidiary if such Subsidiary is subject to restrictions, directly or indirectly, on the payment of dividends or the making of distributions by such Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to the Issuer by operation of the terms of such Restricted Subsidiary's charter or any agreement, instrument, judgment, decree, order, statute or governmental rule or regulation applicable to such Restricted Subsidiary or its shareholders (other than (a) restrictions that have been waived or otherwise released, (b) restrictions pursuant to the Notes or the Indenture, (c) contractual or legal restrictions in effect on the Issue Date with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (including pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Intercreditor Agreement), and other restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Holders than such restrictions in effect on the Issue Date, and (d) restrictions specified in clause (12) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries'') except that the Issuer's equity in the net income of any such Restricted Subsidiary for such period will be included in such Consolidated Net Income up to the aggregate amount of cash or Cash Equivalents or non-cash distributions to the extent converted into cash or Cash Equivalents actually distributed or that could have been distributed by such Restricted Subsidiary during such period to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary as a dividend or other distribution (subject, in the case of a dividend to another Restricted Subsidiary, to the limitation contained in this clause);
(3) any net gain (or loss) realized upon the sale, abandonment or other disposition of any asset or disposed operations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries (including pursuant to any sale/ leaseback transaction) which is not sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business (as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or HoldCo);
