(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and
(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of SEK 500 million, the Issuer has received a written opinion (a ``Fairness Opinion'') from an Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.
