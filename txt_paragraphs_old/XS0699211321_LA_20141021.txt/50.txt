Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness''.
For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.
The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence in which the Issuer is the surviving entity), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Issuer.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase ``substantially all'' under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve ``all or substantially all'' of the property or assets of a Person.
The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this ``Merger and Consolidation'' covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'' or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.
The Guarantors
None of the Guarantors (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:
(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation);
