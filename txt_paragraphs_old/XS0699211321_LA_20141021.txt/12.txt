The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantees of the Notes, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interests in the Collateral. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees of the Notes may be released under certain circumstances as provided under ``-- Release of Liens'' below. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee''.
In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See the section entitled ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--The Notes Guarantees and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability''.
Enforcement of Security Interests
The Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Subject to the calculation requirements described below, the Security Agent is required to only act on the direction of creditors holding more than 50% of the Indebtedness and commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, hedging obligations and the Notes (the ``Majority Senior Secured Creditors''). So long as the Notes constitute no more than 25% or no less than 662/3% of the aggregate Indebtedness and commitments of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the votes of holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action will be treated as proportionately equal to the same as votes of lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and hedging counterparties. However, so long as the Notes constitute more than 25% or less than 66%% of the aggregate Indebtedness and commitments of such creditors, the Notes will be deemed to constitute 25% of the aggregate Indebtedness and commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, hedging obligations and the Notes. Accordingly, the ability of the Holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in such circumstances will be diminished relative to the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the hedging counterparties. In addition, certain of the Security Interests also secure the Senior Bridge Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement provides for circumstances in which the lenders under the Senior Bridge Facility may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of such Security Interests if, amongst other things, the Security Agent has not been instructed to take enforcement action or if the Security Agent has been instructed to take no enforcement action.
The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that in relation to any request for a vote, action or decision by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, including instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral, any such creditor, which includes Holders of the Notes, which fails to respond to, or fails to provide details of its credit participation to, the Security Agent within the timescale specified by the Security Agent (which shall be no less than 20 business days from the date of the relevant request) shall have its credit participation deemed as being zero for the purposes of calculating the participation of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors in respect of such vote, action or decision. If holders of the Notes are unable to respond within the required timeframes, their ability to control or influence matters concerning their rights as holders of the Notes may be lost and such matters will be determined by other creditors which may have interests different from the holder of the Notes.

Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to Be Bound Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under ``-- Certain Covenants--Additional Intercreditor Agreements''. The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
Release of Liens The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees under any one or more of the following circumstances: (1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Collateral to a Person that is not the Issuer or a
