Currency Indemnity and Calculation of SEK-Denominated Restrictions
If that SEK amount is less than the SEK amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantors' other obligations, will give

rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any SEK-denominated restriction herein, the SEK Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-SEK currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-SEK amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.
Enforceability of Judgments
Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.
Consent to Jurisdiction and Service
In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will, in the Indenture, appoint an agent for service of process and irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.
