Guarantees granted after the Issue Date pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall be released as set forth under ``-- Releases of the Guarantees'' and such Guarantees (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Guarantees to be granted during the Post-Completion Period) may also be released at the option of the Issuer if, at the date of such release, (i) the Indebtedness which required such Guarantee has been released or discharged, (ii) no Event of Default would arise as a result of such release, and (iii) there is no other Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as of the date Incurred if such Guarantor were not a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:
(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant cannot be reclassified;
(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant;
(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;
(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and
(7) the amount of Indebtedness at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.
