(8) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of SEK 100 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the ``security default provisions''); and
However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under ``Events of Default'' has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.
If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
