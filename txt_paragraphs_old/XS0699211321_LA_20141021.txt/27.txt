otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, an Excluded Contribution or a Parent Debt Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'' to the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the extent the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under ``--Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'' in reliance thereon;
(14) Indebtedness under daylight borrowing facilities incurred in connection with any refinancing of Indebtedness (including by way of set-off or exchange); provided that such Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced and the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing, so long as any such Indebtedness is repaid within three days of the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred; and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary which is a Significant Subsidiary shall Guarantee any Credit Facility of the Issuer or a Guarantor or any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect to a Credit Facility unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, rules regarding corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any obligation under the Guarantee itself) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent required by applicable law or customary practice.
Guarantees granted after the Issue Date pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall be released as set forth under ``-- Releases of the Guarantees'' and such Guarantees (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Guarantees to be granted during the Post-Completion Period) may also be released at the option of the Issuer if, at the date of such release, (i) the Indebtedness which required such Guarantee has been released or discharged, (ii) no Event of Default would arise as a result of such release, and (iii) there is no other Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as of the date Incurred if such Guarantor were not a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
