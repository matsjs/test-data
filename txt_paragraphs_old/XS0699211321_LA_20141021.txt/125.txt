Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:
(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.
Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue, or cause to be issued, Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.
In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by such Indenture or applicable law.
To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.
We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.
