The Issuer's ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries (including without limitation the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--The Group may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event as required by the Indenture''.
The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.
Certain Covenants
Limitation on Indebtedness
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is no greater than (x) 5.5 to 1.0, if the date of such Incurrence is prior to the one-year anniversary of the Issue Date or (y) 5.25 to 1.0, if the date of such Incurrence is on or after the one-year anniversary of the Issue Date.

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (i) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantee of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, any such guarantee of the Issuer or a Guarantor with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor's Guarantee of the Notes, as applicable, substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantee of the Notes of such Guarantor, as applicable, and (ii) if such guarantee is of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Restricted Subsidiary complies with the third paragraph of this covenant; or
