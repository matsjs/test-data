The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest coupons attached, as follows:
· Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
167
``Regulation S Global Notes'' and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ``Global Notes''). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (``Book-Entry Interests'') will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under ``Notice to Investors''. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the ``144A Book-Entry Interests'') may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ``Regulation S Book-Entry Interests'') only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ``qualified institutional buyer'' within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ``Notice to Investors'' and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
