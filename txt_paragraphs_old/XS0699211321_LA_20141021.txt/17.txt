On September 29, 2018, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar will select Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Note of SEK 1,000,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of SEK 1,000, will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer will mail notice of redemption to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may also be posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
173
the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
Redemption for Taxation Reasons
The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a ``Tax Redemption Date'') and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the Issuer or any Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and (a) the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it, (b) in the case of a Guarantor, such amounts cannot be paid by the Issuer or any other Guarantor who in turn can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts and (c) the requirement arises as a result of:
(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction (as defined in the ``Withholding Taxes'' section below) which change or amendment is announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date); or
