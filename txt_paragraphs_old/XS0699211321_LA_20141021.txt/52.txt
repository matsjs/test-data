(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture and the proceeds therefrom are applied as required by the Indenture,
197
violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction, (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.
Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor or the Issuer and (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Guarantor or the Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Guarantor.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase ``substantially all'' under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve ``all or substantially all'' of the property or assets of a Person.
