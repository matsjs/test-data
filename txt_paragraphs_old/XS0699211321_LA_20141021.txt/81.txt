``Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage" means the sum of the aggregate outstanding Senior Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (excluding Hedging Obligations).
``Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio" means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage at such date to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent two consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available multiplied by 2.0; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation of the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness incurred on the date of determination pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under the caption ``--Certain covenants-- Limitation on Indebtedness" or (ii) the discharge on the date of determination of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds incurred pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under the caption ``--Certain covenants-- Limitation on Indebtedness" ; provided, further, however, that for the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA for such period, if, as of such date of determination:

(2) since the beginning of such period, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) has made an Investment in any Person that thereby becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or otherwise has acquired any company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business or a Person otherwise becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (and remains a Restricted Subsidiary at the end of such period) (any such Investment, acquisition or designation, a ``Purchase" ), including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Purchase occurred on the first day of such period; and
