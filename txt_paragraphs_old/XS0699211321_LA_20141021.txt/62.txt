(10) as provided in ``--Certain Covenants--Additional Intercreditor Agreements''.
In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.
The Issuer will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any of the foregoing amendments, supplements and waivers and provide, if necessary, a supplement to this Offering Memorandum setting forth reasonable details in connection with any such amendments, supplements or waivers.
The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
