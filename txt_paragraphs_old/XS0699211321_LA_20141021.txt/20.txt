(7) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes, to comply with any reasonable written request of the Issuer addressed to the holder or beneficial owner and made at least 60 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such certification or documentation; or

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance, or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, or enforcement of, any of the Notes or any Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (5) or (7) above).
If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee (or to a holder or beneficial owner upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon reasonable request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.
Whenever in the Indenture or in this ``Description of Notes'' there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the Notes or any Guarantee and any political subdivision thereof or therein.
Change of Control
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading ``Change of Control'', each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to SEK 1,000,000 or an integral multiple of SEK 1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this heading, ``Change of Control'', in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under ``--Optional Redemption'' or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.
