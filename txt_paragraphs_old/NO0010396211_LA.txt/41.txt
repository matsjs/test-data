(1) such compliance is required or imposed by law as a precondition to exemption from all or a part of the Tax; and
(2) at least sixty (60) days prior to the first interest payment date with respect to which this Clause 17.4 will apply, the Borrower has notified the Bondholders that they will be required to comply with this requirement,
(c) to a Bondholder that does not deal at arm's length (as contemplated by the Income Tax Act (Canada)) with the Borrower at the time the payment is made.
If a Bondholder determines in its reasonable discretion that it has received a refund of any Taxes in relation to which the Borrower has paid an additional amount, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of additional amounts paid by the Borrower), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Bondholder and without interest.
No Additional Amounts will be paid to a Bondholder that is a depositary or its nominee in respect of a Bond to the extent that the beneficial owner of such Bond would not have been entitled to receive payment of the Additional Amounts had the beneficial owner been the Bondholder of the Bond.
