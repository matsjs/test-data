14.1 Guarantee The Guarantors jointly and severally, irrevocably and unconditionally:
(b) undertake with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that, whenever the Issuer does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, the Guarantors shall, on the Bond Trustee's first written demand (No: pakravsgaranti) and in no event any later than five Business Days after the relevant Guarantor's receipt of such demand, pay that amount to the Bond Trustee or as it directs as if it were the principal obligor in respect of that amount, waiving all rights of objections and defences arising from the principal obligor with the written demand being the only requirement and evidence for the Guarantors having to pay any amount due under or in connection with any Finance Document; and
(c) agree with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that if, for any reason, any amount claimed by the Bond Trustee under this clause is not recoverable from the Issuer, then the Guarantor will be liable as a principal debtor and primary obligor to indemnify the Bond Trustee and each Bondholder for any loss each of them may incur as a result of the Issuer failing to pay any amount expressed to be payable by it under a Finance Document on the date when it ought to have been paid.
14.2 Waivers Each Guarantor hereby waives:
(a) any requirement that the Bond Trustee or any of the Bondholders in case of an Event of Default first have to make demand upon or seek to enforce remedies against the Issuer;
(b) any and all defences based on underlying relationships, agreements and transactions whatsoever, including, without limitation, any such relationships, agreements or transactions with any third party for security or otherwise, and right to limit the liability under the guarantee provided hereunder resulting from any failure to give notice of any kind;
(c) any right to exercise right of subrogation into the rights of the Bondholders under the Bond Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Bond Trustee until such time that no amounts are outstanding under this Bond Agreement and any other Finance Document; and
(d) any right to claim reimbursement from the Issuer and/or any other Obligor for payment made hereunder until such time that no amounts are outstanding under this Bond Agreement and any other Finance Document.
