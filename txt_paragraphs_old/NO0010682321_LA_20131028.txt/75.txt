(a) The Issuer shall pay interest on the par value of the Bonds from, and including, the Issue Date at a fixed rate of fifteen per cent. (15%) per annum (the "Fixed Rate"). The accrued interest on the Outstanding Bonds up to and excluding 15 July 2015 shall be settled through the issuance of additional Bonds to the Bondholders (the "Additional Bonds") (for the avoidance of doubt, additional Tranche A Bonds shall be issued to the Tranche A Bondholders and additional Tranche B Bonds shall be Issued to the Tranche B Bondholders).
(b) The accrued interest on the Outstanding Bonds from and including 15 July 2015 shall be settled through cash payment. However, if the Issuer cannot pay any interest in cash on an Interest Payment Date (at the discretion of the Issuer), the accrued interest shall be settled through the issuance of Additional Bonds.
(c) The accrued interest on the Outstanding Bonds from and including 15 July 2016 shall be settled only through cash payment by the Issuer.
(d) The number of Additional Bonds allocated to a Bondholder holding Bonds shall be made by dividing (x) the total accrued interest amount of the Outstanding Bonds for the six months ending on the relevant Interest Payment Date with (y) the total number of Bonds of that Bondholder, provided that the total number of Additional Bonds allocated to a Bondholder shall be rounded to the nearest USD 1.00.
10.2 Interest Payment Dates
Interest payments shall be made in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates each year, the first Interest Payment Date being 15 July 2013 for the Initial Bonds and for the Tap Bonds being the first Interest Payment Date after the Issue Date for the Tap Bonds.
