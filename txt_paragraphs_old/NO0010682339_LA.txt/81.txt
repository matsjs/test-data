On the settlement date of the Put Option, the Issuer shall pay to each of the Bondholders holding Bonds to be redeemed, the principal amount of each such Bond (including any premium pursuant to Clause 11.3.1) and any unpaid (or uncapitalised) interest accrued up to (but not including) the settlement date.
Mandatory prepayment - sale or disposal of Subsidiaries
Upon the occurrence of a Mandatory Prepayment Event, the Issuer shall, at the earlier of (A) the day the relevant member of the Debtor Group receives the proceeds following the relevant Mandatory Repayment Event (if any) and (B) 30 days after the event triggering the actual Mandatory Repayment Event, redeem 100% of the Outstanding Bonds (save as in the event of a Finnish Release where the redemption amount shall be limited to the Disposal Proceeds at par value (plus applicable accrued interest)) as follows:
(a) if occurring anytime from the Issue Date to (but not including) the Interest Payment date in July 2016, at a price equivalent to the sum of:
(i) the present value on the relevant record date of 110% of the par value discounted from the Interest Payment Date in July 2016; and
(ii) the present value on the relevant record date of the remaining interest payments (less any accrued but unpaid interest, as such interest shall be paid in full) through and including the Interest Payment Date in July 2016,
(iii) all calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable rate for Norwegian Treasury Bills/Government Bonds for the NOK Tranche and the comparable U.S. Treasury Rate for the USD Tranche (i.e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Bonds until the Interest Payment Date in July 2016) (plus accrued interest on redeemed amount) and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Bond Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Securities Depository and the Issuer in connection with the such repayment; and
(b) if occurring anytime from and including the Interest Payment Date in July 2016 to, but not including, the Maturity Date, at a price equal to the Call Option as set out in Clause 11.2 (plus accrued interest on redeemed amount).
