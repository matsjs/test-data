(i) the Incurrence Test, calculated pro forma including such disposal is met; or
(ii) if the Incurrence Test is not met, provided that the net proceeds from such disposal is paid directly to the Deposit Account;

The Trustee shall release any net proceeds standing on the Deposit Account to be used towards reinvestment or partial prepayment (as applicable).
