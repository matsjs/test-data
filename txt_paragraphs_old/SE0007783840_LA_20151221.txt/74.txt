Registration as of nationality
Any Bond-related Aircraft may only be acquired provided that the pledge over the relevant aircraft will confer upon the Trustee and Holders, in all material respects, equivalent or better security interest than if such pledge had been granted under the laws of Sweden.
If an aircraft has been pledged in favour of the Trustee and the Holders (as represented by the Trustee), the Group Companies shall only have a right to make a change to the registration as of nationality of the aircraft from the nationality register in which it is registered to the nationality register of another state if (i) such other state is an ICAO Contracting State, (ii) the pledge over the aircraft survives the change of registration and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders (as represented by the Trustee) under the pledge are, in the Trustee's sole opinion and discretion, preserved, protected and not adversely affected by such change o f registration, or (iii) a new pledge is granted over the aircraft after the change of registration has been made which, in the Trustee's sole opinion and discretion, confer upon the Trustee and the Holders (as represented by the Trustee) an, in all material respects, equivalent or better security interest and provided that the rights of the Trustee and the Holders (as represented by the Trustee) are not, in the Trustee's sole opinion and discretion, negatively affected by such change of registration in any other way.
If any Bond-related Aircraft to be acquired is registered with an ICAO Contracting State (other than Sweden), and it is possible to register a pledge in accordance with the Cape Town Convention (Sw. Kapstadskonventionen och luftfartsprotokollet), a registration of the pledge, shall be made both in the applicable national register and the international register of the Cape Town Convention, provided that such national registration (in addition to the international registration) does not result in material expenses for the Group, where it shall be assumed that any security consisting of security interest according to the Cape Town Convention combined with security interest in the applicable national register, will confer upon the Trustee and the Holders an equivalent security interest, unless proven otherwise.
