13.11 Listing of Notes
13.11.1
The Issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that within thirty (30) calendar days after the First Issue Date, the Initial Notes are listed on the corporate bond list of NASDAQ Stockholm or, if such admission to trading is not possible to obtain or maintain, admitted to trading on another Regulated Market.
13.11.2
Following an admission to trading on the corporate bond list of NASDAQ Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable), the Issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Notes continue being listed thereon (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of NASDAQ Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Notes in close connection to the redemption of the Notes).
13.12 Suspension of certain covenants
If on any date following the First Issue Date, the Notes are assigned an external credit rating of at least BBB- (or equivalent) by a Rating Agency and no Event of Default is continuing then the Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of these events and beginning on that date and until such time as the Notes cease to have an external credit rating of at least BBB- (or equivalent), Conditions 13.4 (Distributions and other transactions), 13.5 (Financial Indebtedness), 13.7 (Dealings with related parties) and 13.8 (Disposal o f assets) shall not apply. Any action taken by a Group Company during any such covenant suspension that would otherwise give rise to a breach of the aforementioned Conditions upon such covenant suspension ceasing to be in effect shall be deemed not to be a breach of these Terms and Conditions.
