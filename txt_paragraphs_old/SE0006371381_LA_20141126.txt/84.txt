When the financial statements and other information are made available to the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 12.1.1, the Issuer shall send copies of such financial statements and other information to the Trustee.
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Trustee in writing (with full particulars) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default, and shall provide the Trustee with such further information as the Trustee may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Trustee not receive such information, the Trustee is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Trustee does not have actual knowledge by way of written notice of such event or circumstance. The Issuer shall also certify to the Trustee when the audited annual Financial Statements in Condition 12.1.1(a) are delivered, that there has been no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default.
The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Trustee as set out in this Condition 12 if informing the Trustee would not conflict with any applicable laws or, when the Notes are listed, the Issuer's registration contract with the Regulated Market. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek approval from the Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Trustee, in order to be able to timely inform the Trustee as set out in this Condition 12.
