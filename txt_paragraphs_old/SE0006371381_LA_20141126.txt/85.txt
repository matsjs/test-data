The Issuer shall immediately notify the Trustee in writing (with full particulars) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default, and shall provide the Trustee with such further information as the Trustee may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Trustee not receive such information, the Trustee is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Trustee does not have actual knowledge by way of written notice of such event or circumstance. The Issuer shall also certify to the Trustee when the audited annual Financial Statements in Condition 12.1.1(a) are delivered, that there has been no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default.
Information from the Trustee
Subject to the restrictions of any non-disclosure agreement entered into by the Trustee in accordance with this Condition 12.2.1 and any applicable law, the Trustee is entitled to disclose to the Noteholders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee may if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Noteholders delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
If a committee representing the Noteholders' interests under the Finance Documents has been appointed by the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Decisions by Noteholders), the members of such committee may agree with the Issuer not to disclose information received from the Issuer, provided that it, in the reasonable opinion of such members, is beneficial to the interests of the Noteholders. The Trustee may be a party to such agreement and receive the same information from the Issuer as the members of the committee.

The latest version of these Terms and Conditions (including any document amending these Terms and Conditions) shall be available on the websites of the Group.
The latest versions of the Finance Documents shall be available to the Noteholders at the office of the Issuer and the Trustee during normal business hours.
