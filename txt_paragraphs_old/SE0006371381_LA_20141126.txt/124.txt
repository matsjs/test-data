No Noteholder shall be entitled to make a request of the Security Agent, nor shall any Noteholder be entitled to proceed directly itself against the Issuer and the Guarantors unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails to do so within a reasonable time and such failure is continuing. The Trustee shall not be bound to take any action in relation to the Trust Deed, these Terms and Conditions and the Intercreditor Agreement unless directed to do so in accordance with Conditions 16, 17 and/or 18 as applicable, and it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.
The Trustee is entitled to fees for its work and to be indemnified for costs, losses and liabilities on the terms set out in the Finance Documents and the Trustee's obligations as Trustee under the Finance Documents are conditional upon the due payment of such fees and indemnifications.
The Trustee may act as agent or trustee for several issues of securities issued by or relating to the Issuer and other Group Companies notwithstanding potential conflicts of interest.
