performance before any proceedings may be brought against the Issuer and/or a Guarantor,

The Issuer and each Guarantor:
(a) waives any objection to the choice of or submission to the English courts on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise as regards proceedings in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes; and
(b) agrees that a judgment, declaration or order (whether interim or final) of an English court in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes or any non contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes is conclusive and binding on it and may be enforced against it in the courts of any other jurisdiction.
