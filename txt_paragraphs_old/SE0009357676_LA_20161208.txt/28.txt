(d) a provision of law is a reference to that provision as amended or re-enacted; and
An Event of Default is continuing if it has not been remedied or waived.
When ascertaining whether a limit or threshold specified in Swedish Kronor has been attained or broken, an amount in another currency shall be counted on the basis of the rate of exchange for such currency against Swedish Kronor for the previous Business Day, as published by the Swedish Central Bank (Riksbanken) on its website (www.riksbank.se). If no such rate is available, the most recently published rate shall be used instead.
No delay or omission of the Bond Trustee or of any Bondholder to exercise any right or remedy under the Finance Documents shall impair or operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy.
STATUS OF THE BONDS
The Bonds are denominated in Swedish Kronor and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Bonds and to comply with these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Bonds, the initial Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement.
The initial nominal amount of each Bond is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Initial Nominal Amount"). The aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds as of the Settlement Date is SEK 300,000,000. All Bonds issued on the Settlement Date are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100.00 per cent. of the Initial Nominal Amount.
