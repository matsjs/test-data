The Bond Trustee is entitled to be reimbursed for such cost by the Issuer, provided that such costs shall be approved by the Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the above, no such approval shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred, or for the purpose of investigating or considering (i) an event or circumstance which the Bond Trustee reasonably believes is or may lead to an Event of Default or (ii) a matter relating to the Parent or an Issuer Group Company or the Finance Documents which the Bond Trustee reasonably believes may be detrimental to the interests of the Bondholders under the Finance Documents. Any compensation for damages or other recoveries received by the Bond Trustee from external experts engaged by it for the purpose of carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents shall be distributed in accordance with Clause 18 (Distribution o fproceeds).
