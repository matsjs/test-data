Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to prepay the Bonds in accordance with Clause 10.4.2 on the specified Interest Payment Date.
Mandatory Prepayment due to a Loss Event
In the event of a Loss Event, the Issuer shall as soon as insurance proceeds are available but not later than one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days following the occurrence of a Loss Event, redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Bonds in full at a price per Bond equal to 100.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount, together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
Notwithstanding the above, following a Loss Event described in paragraph (b) or (c) in the definition of Loss Event, the Issuer may instead of a redemption rebuild the relevant Property, subject to:
(a) delivery of an investment plan to the Bond Trustee, approved by the Property Advisor (acting reasonable), describing how the insurance proceeds shall be applied; and
(b) the Issuer demonstrating to the Bond Trustee's satisfaction that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to comply with its obligations under the Finance Documents and to complete the proposed repair or reinstatement and rebuild of the relevant Property,
prior to one hundred and fifty (150) calendar days following the occurrence of a Loss Event (paragraph (a) and (b) jointly referred to as the "Rebuild Criteria").
