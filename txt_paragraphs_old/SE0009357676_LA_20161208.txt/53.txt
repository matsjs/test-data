All amounts payable by the Issuer to the Bondholders shall be made without withholding
imposed or levied by or on behalf of Sweden or any authority thereof or therein unless
such withholding or deduction is required by law or regulation or the interpretation or
application of such laws or regulations. If such withholding or deduction is required, the
Issuer will at the request of the relevant Bondholder pay such additional amounts
(the "Additional Amounts") as are necessary in order that the net amount received by the
relevant Bondholder, after such withholding or deduction, shall be equal to the respective
amounts which would otherwise have been receivable in the absence of such withholding
or deduction.
