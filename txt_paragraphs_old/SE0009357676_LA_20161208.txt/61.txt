(b) the Issuer demonstrating to the Bond Trustee's satisfaction that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to comply with its obligations under the Finance Documents and to complete the proposed repair or reinstatement and rebuild of the relevant Property,
The Issuer shall ensure that the proceeds out of a Loss Event are paid directly to the Escrow Account as soon as they become available (the "Insurance Proceeds"). The Bond Trustee may release the Insurance Proceeds to the Issuer to either (i) fund the redemption of the Bonds in full; or (ii) subject to satisfaction of the Rebuild Criteria, fund the rebuild of each affected Property.
Redemption in relation to a Loss Event shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice to the Bondholders and the Bond Trustee. The notice from the Issuer shall specify the Redemption Date and also the Record Date on which a person shall be registered as a Bondholder to receive the amounts due on such Redemption Date. The notice is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Bonds in full at the applicable amount on the specified Redemption Date.
Early redemption due to illegality and repurchase due to a tax event (call option)
The Issuer may redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Bonds at an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest if it is or becomes unlawful for the Issuer to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents.
The Issuer may repurchase the relevant Bonds if, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, laws or regulations in Sweden, or any change in the interpretation or application of such laws or regulations, which amendment or change is effective on or after the Settlement Date, the Issuer has or will become required to pay any Additional Amount in relation to such Bonds and this obligation cannot be avoided by reasonable measures
