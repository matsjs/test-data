The Bond Trustee shall convene a Bondholders' Meeting as soon as practicable and in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a valid request from the Issuer or the Bondholder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons) by sending a notice thereof to each person who is registered as a Bondholder on a date selected by the Bond Trustee which is no more than five (5) Business Days earlier than the date on which the notice is sent.
The notice pursuant to Clause 20.1 shall include (i) time for the meeting, (ii) place for the meeting, (iii) agenda for the meeting (including each request for a decision by the Bondholders), (iv) the day on which a person must be Bondholder in order to exercise Bondholders' rights at the Bondholders' Meeting, and (v) a form of power of attorney. Only matters that have been included in the notice may be resolved upon at the Bondholders' Meeting. Should prior notification by the Bondholders be required in order to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, such requirement shall be included in the notice.
The Bondholders' Meeting shall be held no earlier than ten (10) Business Days and no later than thirty (30) Business Days after the effective date of the notice.
Without amending or varying these Terms and Conditions, the Bond Trustee may prescribe such further regulations regarding the convening and holding of a Bondholders' Meeting as the Bond Trustee may deem appropriate. Such regulations may include a possibility for Bondholders to vote without attending the meeting in person.
WRITTEN PROCEDURE
The Bond Trustee shall instigate a Written Procedure as soon as practicable and in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a valid request from the Issuer or the Bondholder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons) by sending a communication to each person who is registered as a Bondholder on a date selected by the Bond Trustee which is no more than five (5) Business Days earlier than the date on which the communication is sent.
A communication pursuant to Clause 21.1 shall include (i) each request for a decision by the Bondholders, (ii) a description of the reasons for each request, (iii) a specification of the Business Day on which a person must be registered as a Bondholder in order to be entitled to exercise voting rights, (iv) instructions and directions on where to receive a form for replying to the request (such form to include an option to vote yes or no for each request) as well as a form of power of attorney, and (v) the stipulated time period within which the Bondholder must reply to the request (such time period to last at least ten (10) Business Days and not longer than thirty (30) Business Days from the communication pursuant to Clause 21.1). If the voting is to be made electronically, instructions for such voting shall be included in the communication.
When consents from Bondholders representing the requisite majority of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount pursuant to Clauses 19.7 and 19.8 have been received in a Written Procedure, the relevant decision shall be deemed to be adopted pursuant to Clause 19.7 or 19.8, as the case may be, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
