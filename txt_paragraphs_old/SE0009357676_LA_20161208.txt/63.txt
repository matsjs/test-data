Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event or a Listing Failure Event (put option)
Upon the occurrence of a Listing Failure Event, each Bondholder shall during a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the effective date of a notice from the Issuer of the Listing Failure Event pursuant to Clause 12.1.2 (after which time period such right shall lapse), have the right to request that all, or some only, of its Bonds be repurchased at a price per Bond equal to 101.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
The notice from the Issuer pursuant to Clause 12.1.2 shall specify the Record Date on which a person shall be registered as a Bondholder to receive interest and principal, the Redemption Date and include instructions about the actions that a Bondholder needs to take if it wants Bonds held by it to be repurchased. If a Bondholder has so requested, and acted in accordance with the instructions in the notice from the Issuer, the Issuer shall repurchase the relevant Bonds and the repurchase amount shall fall due on the Redemption Date specified in the notice given by the Issuer pursuant to Clause 12.1.2. The Redemption Date must fall no later than forty (40) Business Days after the end of the period referred to in Clause 10.7.1 and Clause 10.7.2.
If Bonds representing more than 90.00 per cent. of the Total Nominal Amount have been repurchased following a Change of Control Event, the Issuer is entitled to repurchase all the remaining outstanding Bonds at the price per Bond equal to 101.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest by notifying the remaining Bondholders of its intention to do so no later than twenty (20) calendar days after the redemption date referred to in Clause 10.7.3. The Redemption Date in relation to such repurchase may occur at the earliest on the 15th calendar day following the date of such notice and no later than forty (40) Business Days after the end of the period referred to in Clause 10.7.1.
Any Bonds repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to this Clause 10.7 may at the Issuer's discretion be retained or sold.
