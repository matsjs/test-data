12. Information to Bondholders
(a) The Issuer shall as soon as possible notify the Trustee and the Bondholders when the Issuer is or becomes aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event.
(b) The Issuer shall as soon as possible notify the Trustee (with full particulars) when the Issuer is or becomes aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of any of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Trustee with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Trustee not receive such information, the Trustee is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Trustee does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.
(c) The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Trustee according to this Clause 12.1 if informing the Trustee would not conflict with any applicable laws, authority or court orders.
12.2 Information from the Trustee
The Trustee is entitled to disclose to the Bondholders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee may if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Bondholders delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
12.3 Information among the Bondholders
Upon request by a Bondholder, the Trustee shall promptly distribute to the Bondholders any information from such Bondholder which relates to the Bonds. The Trustee may require that the requesting Bondholder reimburses any costs or expenses incurred, or to be incurred, by the Trustee in doing so (including a reasonable fee for the work of the Trustee) before any such information is distributed.
