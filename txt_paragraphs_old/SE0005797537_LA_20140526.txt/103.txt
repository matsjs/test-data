The Agent/Security Agent shall not be considered to have acted negligently if it has acted in accordance with advice from or opinions of reputable external experts engaged by the Agent/Security Agent or if the Agent/Security Agent has acted with reasonable care in a situation when the Agent/Security Agent considers that it is detrimental to the interests of the Holders to delay the action in order to first obtain instructions from the Holders.
