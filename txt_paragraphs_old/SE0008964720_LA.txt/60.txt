12.7.2
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries will, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares, assets or operations in any Pledged Group Company, or in any subsidiary of a Pledged Group Company, to any Group Company other than a Pledged Group Company (or, in relation to such transfers of shares, the Issuer). Any such transfer of shares to a Pledged Group Company or the Issuer shall be subject always to applicable laws and the Issuer procuring that any such shares so transferred which at any time are, are intended to be or have been included in the Transaction Security continues to be pledged following the transfer on the same or substantially similar terms and with such priority of security as is satisfactory to the Agent (acting reasonably). In addition, any transfer of shares (as described above) shall always be made subject to the existing pledge and permitted only if the transaction (taken as a whole) does not adversely affect the pledge over such shares (e.g., by resulting in a hardening period or reduced enforceability of the pledge under applicable laws). The Issuer shall notify the Agent of any such transfer of shares in accordance with Clause 12.11.2.
