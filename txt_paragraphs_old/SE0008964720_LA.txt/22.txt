THE AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND UNDERTAKING TO MAKE PAYMENTS
The aggregate amount of the bond loan will be an amount of EUR 100,000,000 which will be represented by Bonds, each of a nominal amount of EUR 100,000 or full multiples thereof (the "Nominal Amount"). The ISIN for the Bonds is SE0008964720. All Bonds issued in the Initial Bond Issue are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of one hundred (100.00) per cent. of the Nominal Amount. The minimum permissible investment in connection with the Initial Bond Issue is EUR 100,000.
The Issuer may at one or more occasions after the Issue Date issue Subsequent Bonds under these Terms and Conditions (each such issue, a "Subsequent Bond Issue"), until the total amount under such Subsequent Bond Issue(s) and the Initial Bond Issue equals EUR 100,000,000, always provided that the Incurrence Test (calculated pro forma including such issue) is met. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the Interest Rate, the Nominal
Amount, the Final Redemption Date and other rights applicable to the Bonds issued on the Issue Date shall apply also to Subsequent Bonds. The price of Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount.
