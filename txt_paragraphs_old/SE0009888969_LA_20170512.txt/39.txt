11. Priority of the Super Senior RCF
The relationship between the Bondholders and the creditors in respect of the Super Senior RCF and the Super Senior Hedges will be governed by the Intercreditor Agreement, which, among other things, will implement the following principles:
(a) Priority of the Super Senior RCF in case of insolvency
In the case of insolvency of the Issuer, the Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer under the Bonds will be subordinated to the Financial Indebtedness owed by the Issuer under the Super Senior RCF and the Super Senior Hedges.
(b) Priority of the Super Senior RCF with respect to Shared Security
In case of enforcement of the Shared Security, any enforcement proceeds will first be applied towards repayment of the Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer under the Super Senior RCF and the Super Senior Hedges and secondly towards redemption of the Bonds.
(c) Consultation period before enforcement of Shared Security
If Conflicting Enforcement Instructions (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are provided by the Agent or the agent under the Super Senior RCF the Agent and the agent under the Super Senior RCF must enter into consultations for a period of maximum thirty (30) calendar days as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (unless such consultation is waived by the Agent and the agent under the Super Senior RCF).
