(c) The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent and the Bondholders upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, Listing Failure or Delisting and shall provide the Agent with such further information as the Agent may request (acting reasonably) following receipt of such notice.

(f) The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.

If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek approval from the Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to this Clause 12.1.
(h) When and for as long as the Bonds are listed, the financial reports mentioned in paragraph 12.1(a) above shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS and made available in accordance with the rules and regulations of NASDAQ Stockholm (as amended from time to time) and the Swedish Securities Market Act.
