to such Bonds are automatically transferred to the transferee.
No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public
offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other
material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where
action for that purpose is required. Each Holder must inform itself about, and observe, any
applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds, (due to,
e.g., its nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) of business). Each
Holder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
