18.5 19. 19.1 19.2
WRITTEN PROCEDURE
The Agent shall instigate a Written Procedure no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of a request (including proposed decisions to the Holders) from the Issuer or the Holder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons) by sending a communication to each Person who is registered as a Holder with the CSD on the Business Day prior to the date on which the communication is sent.
Should the Issuer want to replace the Agent, it may send a communication in accordance with Clause 18.1 to each Holder with a copy to the Agent.
A communication pursuant to Clause 18.1 shall include (i) each request for a decision by the Holders, (ii) a description of the reasons for each request, (iii) a specification of the Business Day on which a Person must be registered as a Holder in order to be entitled to exercise voting rights, (iv) instructions and directions on where to receive a form for replying to the request (such form to include an option to vote yes or no for each request) as well as a form of power of attorney, and (v) the stipulated time period within which the Holder must reply to the request (such time period to last at least ten (10) Business Days from the communication pursuant to Clause 18.1). If the voting shall be made electronically, instructions for such voting shall be included in the communication.
If the Agent, in breach of these Terms and Conditions, has not instigated a Written Procedure within ten (10) Business Days after having received such notice, the requesting person may instigate a Written Procedure itself. If the requesting person is a Holder, the Issuer shall upon request from such Holder provide the Holder with necessary information from the register kept by the CSD.
When the requisite majority consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount pursuant to Clauses 16.5 and 16.6 have been received in a Written Procedure, the relevant decision shall be deemed to be adopted pursuant to Clause 16.5 or 16.6, as the case may be, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
RIGHT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A HOLDER
If any Person other than a Holder wishes to exercise any rights under the Finance Documents, it must obtain a power of attorney (or, if applicable, a coherent chain of powers of attorney), a certificate from the authorised nominee or other sufficient proof of authorisation for such Person.
