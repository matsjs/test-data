The Issuer may at one or more occasions after the First Issue Date issue Subsequent Bonds under these Terms and Conditions (each such issue, a "Subsequent Bond Issue"), until the total amount under such Subsequent Bond Issue(s) and the Initial Bond Issue equals SEK 500,000,000, always provided that the Incurrence Test is met (calculated pro forma including the Subsequent Bond Issue) and that the Issuer provides the Agent with a Compliance Certificate. Any Subsequent Bonds shall be issued subject to the same Terms and Conditions as the Initial Bonds. The price of Subsequent Bonds may be set at the Nominal Amount, at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount.
The Bonds are denominated in SEK and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to these Terms and Conditions and by acquiring Bonds each subsequent Holder confirms these Terms and Conditions.
STATUS OF THE BONDS
The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank at least pari passu with all direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and without any preference among them.
USE OF PROCEEDS
The Net Proceeds shall be used towards general corporate purposes, including, for the avoidance of doubt, property acquisitions and refinancing of existing debt.
