THE AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND UNDERTAKING TO MAKE PAYMENTS
The aggregate amount of the bond loan will be an amount of up to SEK 500,000,000 which will be represented by Bonds, each of a nominal amount of SEK 1,000,000 or full multiples thereof (the "Nominal Amount"). The total nominal amount of the Initial Bonds is SEK 350,000,000 ("Initial Bond Issue"). All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of one hundred (100.00) per cent. of the Nominal Amount.
The ISIN for the Bonds is SE0010833491.
The minimum permissible investment in the Initial Bond Issue and any Subsequent Bond Issue is SEK 1,000,000, and integral multiples thereof.
The Issuer may at one or more occasions after the First Issue Date issue Subsequent Bonds under these Terms and Conditions (each such issue, a "Subsequent Bond Issue"), until the total amount under such Subsequent Bond Issue(s) and the Initial Bond Issue equals SEK 500,000,000, always provided that the Incurrence Test is met (calculated pro forma including the Subsequent Bond Issue) and that the Issuer provides the Agent with a Compliance Certificate. Any Subsequent Bonds shall be issued subject to the same Terms and Conditions as the Initial Bonds. The price of Subsequent Bonds may be set at the Nominal Amount, at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount.
The Issuer undertakes to repay the Bonds, to pay Interest and to otherwise act in accordance and comply with these Terms and Conditions.
