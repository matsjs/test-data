Mandatory redemption due to failure to fulfil the Conditions Precedent for Disbursement
Mandatory partial repayment due to a Permitted Divestment
Upon a Permitted Divestment occurring, the Issuer shall make a partial repayment of all, but not only some, of the Bonds by way of reducing the Nominal Amount of each Bond pro rata (rounded down to a multiple of SEK 1,000) with a total amount corresponding to the applicable Mandatory Repayment Amount (for the avoidance of doubt, if the applicable Mandatory Repayment Amount exceeds the aggregate outstanding Nominal Amount at the time of the relevant repayment, the Mandatory Repayment Amount shall be reduced to the aggregate outstanding Nominal Amount). The repayment shall be executed on the first possible Interest Payment Date (taking into account the rules and regulations of the CSD) following the Permitted Divestment and be made at a price equal to one hundred and five (105.00) per cent. of the repaid Nominal Amount, together with accrued but unpaid Interest on the repaid Nominal Amount.
Repayment in accordance with Clause 11.6.1 shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than ten (10) Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent. Any such notice is irrevocable and shall state the relevant Interest Payment Date on which repayment shall be made, the Nominal Amount to be repaid and the relevant Record Date. The Agent shall, upon the Issuer's request, release any amount standing to the credit of the Deposit Account, provided that such amount without delay shall be applied by the Issuer to partially repay the Bonds in accordance with this Clause 11.6.
SPECIAL UNDERTAKINGS
So long as any Bond remains outstanding, the Issuer undertakes to comply with the special undertakings set forth in this Clause 12.
Distributions
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of its Subsidiaries will, (i) pay any dividend on shares, (ii) repurchase any of its own shares, (iii) redeem its share capital or other
