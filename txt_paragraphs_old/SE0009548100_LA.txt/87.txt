per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a
request is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Holders, be made by them
jointly) for a decision by the Holders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall be
directed to the Agent and dealt with at a Holders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure,
as determined by the Agent. The Person requesting the decision may suggest the form for
decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt
with at a Holders' Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a
Holders' Meeting.
