The CSD may retire from its assignment or be dismissed by the Issuer, provided that the Issuer has effectively appointed a replacement CSD that accedes as CSD at the same time as the old CSD retires or is dismissed and provided also that the replacement does not have a negative effect on any Holder or the listing of the Bonds listed on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). The replacing CSD must be authorised to professionally conduct clearing operations pursuant to the Swedish Securities Market Act (Sw. lag (2007:528) om vardepappersmarknaden).

NO DIRECT ACTIONS BY HOLDERS
A Holder may not take any steps whatsoever against any Group Company or the Guarantor to enforce or recover any amount due or owing to it pursuant to the Finance Documents, or to initiate, support or procure the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw. företagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of any Group Company or the Guarantor in relation to any of the liabilities of such Group Company or the Guarantor under the Finance Documents.
Clause 23.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 20.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance Documents or by any reason described in Clause 20.2.10, such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 20.2.11 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Clause 23.1.
