(i) 4.25 from the First Issue Date up to and including 31 December 2018;
(ii) 3.75 from 1 January 2019 up to and including 31 December 2019; and
(iii) 3.25 from 1 January 2020 up to and including the Final Redemption Date.

13.4 Testing of the Incurrence Test
The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than three month prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness, or making of a Restricted Payment, as applicable. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt).
