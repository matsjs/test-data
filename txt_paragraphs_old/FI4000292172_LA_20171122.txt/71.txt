(d) If the Bondholders have not appointed a successor Trustee within ninety (90) days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Trustee was dismissed through a decision by the Bondholders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Trustee which shall be an independent financial institution or other independent reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances and which is registered (if required to be so registered by the Act on Noteholders' Agent) in the public register of noteholders' agents referred to in the Act on Noteholders' Agent.
