THE AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND UNDERTAKING TO MAKE PAYMENTS
The aggregate amount of the bond loan will be an amount of up to EUR 100,000,000 which will be represented by Bonds, each of an initial nominal amount of EUR 100,000 or full multiples thereof (the "Initial Nominal Amount"). The nominal amount of each Bond will be the Initial Nominal Amount, less the aggregate amount by which each Bond has been partly repaid in accordance with Clauses 11.4 (Voluntary Partial Repayment), 11.5 (Equity Claw Back) or 11.7 (Mandatory Partial Repayment upon an Acquisition Failure) (the "Nominal Amount"). The maximum total nominal amount of the Initial Bonds is EUR 70,000,000 ("Initial Bond Issue"). All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount. The ISIN for the Bonds is SE0005799194. The minimum permissible investment in connection with the Initial Bond Issue is EUR 100,000.
Provided that the Incurrence Test is met (calculated pro forma including such issue), the Issuer may, on one or more occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds amounting to in total maximum EUR 30,000,000. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to these Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the Interest Rate, the Nominal Amount, the Final Redemption Date shall apply also to Subsequent Bonds, which also otherwise shall have the same rights as the Initial Bonds. The price of Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal amount of the Bonds (the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed EUR 100,000,000.
The Issuer undertakes to repay the Bonds, to pay Interest and to otherwise act in accordance and comply with these Terms and Conditions.
