(j) Continuation of the business: The Issuer or any other Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business, except if due to (i) a merger or demerger that is not prohibited by Clause 17.1 (g) or (ii) a disposal which is not prohibited by Clause 12.7.
Termination for payment prematurely on the grounds mentioned in Clauses 17.1 (c) and (d)
or, regarding any of the Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Clauses 17.1 (e), (f), (g),
(h) and (j) may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would
have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of
the Agent's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium
will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in
Clause 17.1 (e).
