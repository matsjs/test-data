Provided that the Incurrence Test is met (calculated pro forma including such issue), the Issuer may, on one or more occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds amounting to in total maximum EUR 30,000,000. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to these Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the Interest Rate, the Nominal Amount, the Final Redemption Date shall apply also to Subsequent Bonds, which also otherwise shall have the same rights as the Initial Bonds. The price of Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal amount of the Bonds (the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed EUR 100,000,000.
The Bonds are denominated in EUR and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds each subsequent Holder confirms such agreements.
STATUS OF THE BONDS
The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them. The Bonds are secured by the security provided pursuant to the Security Documents.
