For the purpose of exercising the rights of the Holders and the Agent under these Terms and
any security created under the Security Documents, the Issuer irrevocably authorises and
empowers the Agent to act in the name of the Issuer, and on behalf of the Issuer, to instruct
the CSD to arrange for payment to the Holders in accordance with Clause 5.7. To the extent
permissible by law, the powers set out in this Clause 5.8 are irrevocable and shall be valid 16
for as long as any Bonds remain outstanding. The Issuer shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance to the Agent's satisfaction), which the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out its duties under Clause 5.7. Especially, the Issuer shall, upon the Agent's request, provide the Agent with a written power of attorney empowering the Agent to change the bank account registered with the CSD to a bank account in the name of the Agent and to instruct the CSD to pay out funds originating from an enforcement in accordance with Clause 5.7 to the Holders through the CSD.
