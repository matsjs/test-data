Guarantee
The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally:
(a) guarantees to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), as for their own debt and not merely as surety, the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all its obligations under the Finance Documents;
(b) undertakes with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that, whenever the Issuer does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, the Guarantor shall, on the Bond Trustee's written demand (No: selvskyldnergaranti) and in no event any later than five (5) Business Days after the Guarantor's receipt of such demand, pay that amount to the Bond Trustee or as it directs as if it were the principal obligor in respect of that amount; and
(c) agrees with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that if, for any reason, any amount claimed by the Bond Trustee under this Guarantee is not recoverable from the Guarantor, then the Guarantor will be liable as a principal debtor and primary obligor to indemnify the Bond Trustee and each Bondholder for any loss each of them may incur as a result of the Issuer failing to pay any amount expressed to be payable by it under a Finance Document on the date when it ought to have been paid.
