The interest rate is reset in accordance with sub-clause 9.2.
On each Interest Payment Date, the Borrower shall pay accrued interest due on such Interest Payment Date in cash using Available Cash. To the extent that the Borrower determines that there is insufficient Available Cash to pay all or part of the accrued
20/42
interest payable on the relevant Interest Payment Date and shall not be paying all or part of the accrued interest due on an Interest Payment Date in cash, the Borrower shall:
(i) not later than four Banking Days before the relevant Interest Payment Date, issue a notice to the Loan Trustee (for immediate distribution to the Bondholders) and the paying agent appointed in connection with the Bonds at the time confirming the amount (if any) of interest that is to be paid in cash and the amount of interest that is to be paid by way of PIK Interest (as defined and described below), and providing a detailed calculation of the Cash and Available Cash in the Group; and
(ii) on the relevant Interest Payment Date, satisfy its payment obligations with respect to the portion of the accrued interest that cannot be paid in cash due to insufficient Available Cash (such amount, the "Unpaid Accrued Interest") by the issue of additional Bonds (the "PIK Interest") by the Borrower to the Bondholders on a pro rata basis in amount equivalent to (a) the Unpaid Accrued Interest plus (b) the amount of additional interest that would have accrued on that portion of the Remaining Loan to which the Unpaid Accrued Interest relates since the last Interest Payment Date had the interest rate during that period been LIBOR plus the applicable PIK Margin.
For avoidance of doubt, the issue of additional Bonds in payment of PIK Interest shall be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the amount of PIK Interest that is payable on the Remaining Loan at each following Interest Payment Date.
9.2 The interest rate on the Loan is reset with effect from each Interest Payment Date on LIBOR plus the Margin. Should LIBOR not be available, after 14 February 2014 the interest rate will be reset based on LIBOR Reference Banks plus the Margin.
When the interest is set for the first time and on subsequent interest rate resets, the next Interest Payment Date and the actual number of calendar days up to that date must be notified to the Bondholders in writing via the Securities Depository. This communication must also include the interest rate applicable up to the next Interest Payment Date. The Loan Trustee and, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange shall be notified of the new interest rate immediately.
