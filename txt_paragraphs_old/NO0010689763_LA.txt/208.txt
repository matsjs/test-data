16.4 In the event that the Bond Trustee pursuant to the terms of Clauses 16.2 or 16.3 declares the Outstanding Bonds to be in default and due for payment, the Bond Trustee shall immediately deliver to the Issuer a notice demanding payment of interest and principal due to the Bondholders under the Outstanding Bonds including accrued interest and interest on overdue amounts and expenses. The claim derived from the Outstanding Bonds due for payment as a result of an Event of Default shall be calculated at the prices set out in Clause 10.2.
16.5 In the event of enforcement of the Issuer Share Pledge, the Bond Trustee's position as shareholder may entail the risk of certain direct liabilities, such as pension liabilities, on the part of the Bond Trustee. If there is a risk of any such liability accruing in relation to an enforcement of the Issuer Share Pledge to the benefit of the Bondholders, the Bond Trustee may require satisfactory security and indemnities from the Bondholders for any such possible liability prior to enforcement of the Issuer Share Pledge.
