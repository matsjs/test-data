The obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder are continuing obligations and will extend to the payment of the ultimate balance of all amounts payable by the Obligors under the Bond Agreement and the other Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
The total liability of each of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, in aggregate, shall always be limited to USD 330,000,000 plus interest, default interest, fees, costs, recovery costs, expenses and indemnities as set out in or provided for in the Bond Agreement.
13.4 Number of Claims
There is no limit on the number of claims that may be made by the Bond Trustee against a Guarantor under this Guarantee.
13.5 Waiver of Defences
Each Guarantor's liability to the Bond Trustee under this Guarantee is direct and independent of the contractual relationship between the other Obligors and the Bond Trustee under this Bond Agreement and another Obligor under the Finance Documents. The Guarantor specifically waives any right to raise any defence (Norwegian: "innsigelser") under this Guarantee otherwise available to the other Obligors under this Bond Agreement and the Finance Documents and otherwise under any applicable law. Accordingly, each Guarantor's liability to the Bond Trustee under this Guarantee shall not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Guarantee (without limitation and whether or not known to it, the Bond Trustee or any other party) including:
(a)
any discussion or dispute between another Obligor and the Bond Trustee on the
appropriateness or legality of any claim made by the Bond Trustee against another
