Any notice that the Issuer or the Agent shall send to the Noteholders pursuant to Clauses 10.3 (Voluntary total redemption (call option)), 10.4 (Voluntary partial redemption (call option)) and 10.5 (Voluntary partial redemption upon an Equity Listing Event (call option)) 10.6 (Early redemption due to illegality (call option)), 10.7 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change o f Control Event or a Listing Failure Event (put option)), 15.3, 17.17, 18.1, 19.1 and 20.3 shall also be published by way of press release by the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable.
FORCE MAJEURE AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Neither the Agent nor the Issuing Agent shall be held responsible for any damage arising out of any legal enactment, or any measure taken by a public authority, or war, strike, lockout, boycott, blockade, natural disaster, insurrection, civil commotion, terrorism or any other similar circumstance (a "Force Majeure Event"). The reservation in respect of strikes, lockouts, boycotts and blockades applies even if the Agent or the Issuing Agent itself takes such measures, or is subject to such measures.
The Issuing Agent shall have no liability to the Noteholders if it has observed reasonable care. The Issuing Agent shall never be responsible for indirect damage with exception of gross negligence and wilful misconduct.
Should a Force Majeure Event arise which prevents the Agent or the Issuing Agent from taking any action required to comply with these Terms and Conditions, such action may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed.
The provisions in this Clause 27 apply unless they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Financial Instruments Accounts Act which provisions shall take precedence.
GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
These Terms and Conditions, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection therewith, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Sweden.2*
The Issuer submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the City Court of Stockholm (Stockholms tingsrätt). The submission to the jurisdiction of the Swedish courts shall however not limit the right of the Agent (or the Noteholders, as applicable) to take proceedings against the Issuer in any court which may otherwise exercise jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its assets.
