Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Notes shall be made quarterly in arrears to the Noteholders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360-days basis).
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) per cent. higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, following the occurrence of a Payment Block Event and for as long as it is continuing, no payment of Interest or principal in respect of the Notes shall be made to the Noteholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the Notes will carry Interest according to Clause 9.4 during such period.
