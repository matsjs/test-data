Calculation Adjustments
The figures for EBITDA set out in the financial statements as of the most recent Quarter Date (including when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date), shall be used, but adjusted so that:
(a) entities acquired or disposed (i) during a test period or (ii) after the end of the test period but before the relevant testing date, will be included or excluded (as applicable) pro forma for the entire test period; and
(b) the pro forma calculation of EBITDA takes into account net cost savings and other reasonable cost reduction synergies, which has been certified, based on reasonable assumptions, by the chief financial officer of the Group, in any financial year in aggregate not exceeding ten (10) per cent. of EBITDA of the Group (including all acquisitions made during the relevant financial year), as the case may be, realisable for the Group within twelve (12) months from the acquisition as a result of acquisitions of entities referred to in paragraph (a) above.
The figures for Net Interest Payable set out in the financial statements as of the most recent Quarter Date (including when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date), shall be used, but adjusted so that Net Interest Payable for such period shall be:
(a) reduced by an amount equal to the Net Interest Payable directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer or of any other Group Company repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to the Issuer and the continuing Group Companies with the proceeds from disposals of entities referred to in paragraph (a) in Clause 14.5 (Adjustment to EBITDA) (or, if the Financial Indebtedness is owed by a Group Company that is sold, the Net Interest Payable for such period directly attributable to the Financial Indebtedness of such Group Company to the extent the Issuer and the continuing Group Companies are no longer liable for such Financial Indebtedness after such sale);
