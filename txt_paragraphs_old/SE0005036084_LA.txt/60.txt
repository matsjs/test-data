Any stamp duty and other costs that will become payable in connection with the Additional Mortgages shall be immediately paid by the Issuer upon demand by the Agent and in accordance with the Account Pledge Agreement, the Agent has a right to, and is instructed by the Issuer to, immediately upon the issue of Additional Mortgages, apply any amounts standing to the credit of the Account towards payment of any such stamp duty and such other costs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent has the right to act in its sole discretion in relation to the application for and issue of Additional Mortgages and the payment of stamp duty in connection therewith and no further action or authorisation is required from the Issuer or Uarda2 in relation thereto.
Any Additional Mortgages shall become subject to the Promissory Note and the Promissory Note Pledge Agreement in accordance with their terms.
Without prejudice to the foregoing, upon request by the Agent, the Issuer shall, at its own expense, promptly do all such acts (and shall ensure that Uarda2 does all acts) and duly execute and deliver any and all such transfers, powers of attorney and other further documents as the Agent may reasonably deem necessary and/or desirable for the purpose of issuing Additional Mortgages.
