The Company's properties are developed and improved in response to changing demand. Project plans are prepared for new builds, while properties with development potential are acquired, developed and then either transferred to the Group's investment portfolio or sold. New builds and more extensive development projects are always based on the principles of environmental building and energy requirements that comfortably fulfil the criteria for the EU GreenBuilding programme.

Fabege's third cornerstone is business development, which focuses on transactions, analyses, valuations and portfolio and business development. Acquisitions and sales are a natural feature of what Fabege do.
The Company continuously analyses its portfolio to take advantage of opportunities to increase capital growth. Fabege aims to acquire properties with good growth potential, located within the Company's sub-markets. Fabege plan to sell the properties at the right time to realise accrued value.
Location, condition and vacancies are key factors determining the growth potential of a property. A fully let property with modern and efficient premises but deemed to have limited potential for rent increases and capital growth could thus become a candidate for divestment, unless it forms a strategic part of a property cluster, for instance.

As a major player in a significant market, Fabege has built good relationships with local authorities and policy-makers. Fabege also has experience and knowledge of local markets, properties, development plans and other players.
Valuations of the properties are done by internal valuation experts as well as independent external valuation agencies. A model whereby all properties, 25 per cent per quarter, are subject to external appraisal every quarter ensures a realistic market valuation of the property portfolio.
