Risk Factors
Investments in corporate bonds always entail a certain degree of risk and this is also the case for an investment in bonds issued by the Company. A number of factors, both within the Company's control but also factors not controllable by the Company, affect and may come to affect the Company's profit, financial position and the Notes. The risk factors applicable, both general risks attributable to the Company's operations and risks linked directly to the Notes in their capacity of financial instruments, are described below. The intention is to describe risks that are linked to the Company's business and thus also the Company's ability to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. The below overview of risk factors are not ranked in order of importance.
Before making a decision about acquisition of the Notes, any potential investors should carefully consider the risk factors described below, as well as any other provided information about the Company and the Notes. In addition, an investor must, alone or together with its financial and other types of advisers, engage in a general evaluation of external facts, other provided information and general information about the real estate market and real estate companies from its own perspective. An investor should have adequate knowledge to evaluate the risk factors as well as sufficient financial strength to bear these risks.
