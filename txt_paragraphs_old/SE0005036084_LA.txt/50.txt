The distribution of these Terms and Conditions and the offering, and sale of the Notes in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law.
In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the US Securities Act.
§6
REDEMPTION OF NOTES AND PAYMENT OF INTEREST
The Nominal Amount of the Notes shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.
Payment of the Nominal Amount and interest shall be made to a party that is a Noteholder on the fifth Banking Day prior to the respective due date or on the Banking Day closer to the respective due date which may generally be applied on the Swedish bond market (= Record Date).
Where a Noteholder, via the Account Operator, has requested that nominal amounts and interest shall be deposited on a particular bank account, the CSD shall cause such deposit to be made on the respective due date. In other cases, the CSD shall forward the sum on the above-stated date to the Noteholder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. Where the due date is a day which is not a Banking Day, the amount shall be deposited or forwarded on the following Banking Day and, in such circumstances, interest shall only accrue up to and including the original due date.
26
In the event that the CSD, as a consequence of delay by the Issuer or other impediments, is unable to make payment of amounts in accordance with the above provisions, such amounts shall be paid by the CSD to such party who is a Noteholder on the Record Date as soon as the cause for the impediment has terminated.
