Any public fees levied on the trade of Bonds in the secondary market shall be paid by the Bondholders, unless otherwise provided by law or regulation, and the Issuer is not responsible for reimbursing any such fees.
The Issuer shall pay any stamp duty and other public fee accruing in connection with the Bonds, but not in respect of trading in the secondary market (except to the extent required by applicable laws), and shall conduct at source any applicable withholding tax payable pursuant to law.
If the Issuer is required by law to withhold any withholding tax from any payment in respect of the Bonds under the Bond Agreement:
(i)
the amount of the payment due from the Issuer shall be grossed-up to such amount
which is necessary to ensure that the Bondholders receive a net amount which is
(after making the required withholding) equal to the payment which would have been
due if no withholding had been required; and
