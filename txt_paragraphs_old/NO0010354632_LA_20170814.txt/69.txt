Subject to the provisions in this Loan Agreement, anything which may be resolved by the Bondholders in a Bondholders' meeting pursuant to Clause 16 may also be resolved by way of a Written Resolution. A Written Resolution passed with the relevant majority is as valid as if it had been passed by the Bondholders in a Bondholders' meeting, and any reference in any Finance Document to a Bondholders' meeting shall be construed accordingly.
The person requesting a Bondholders' meeting may instead request that the relevant matters are to be resolved by Written Resolution only, unless the Loan Trustee decides otherwise.
17.10.3
The summons for the Written Resolution shall be sent to the Bondholders through the Securities Depository and published at the Loan Trustee's web site, or other relevant electronic platform or via press release.
17.10.4 The summons for a Written Resolution shall include:
(a) instructions as to how to vote for each separate item in the summons (including instructions as to how voting can be done electronically if relevant); and
(b) the time limit within which the Loan Trustee must have received all votes necessary in order for the Written Resolution to be passed with the requisite majority (the "Voting Period"), such Voting Period to be at least three (3) Banking Days but not more than fifteen (15) Banking Days from the date of the summons, provided however that the Voting Period for a Written Resolution summoned pursuant to Clause 18 shall be at least five (5) Banking Days but not more than fifteen (15) Banking Days from the date of the summons.
17.10.5
Only Bondholders of voting Bonds registered with the Securities Depository on the relevant record date, or the beneficial owner thereof having presented relevant evidence to the Loan Trustee, will be counted in the Written Resolution.
