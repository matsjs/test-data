13.2 Testing of Incurrence Test
The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than two (2) months prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness or the making of a Restricted Payment (the "Testing Date"). The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant Testing Date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt). EBITDA shall be calculated as set out in Clause 13.3 below.
