Each Initial Bond carries Interest at the Interest Rate during an Interest Period. Any Subsequent Bonds will carry Interest at the Interest Rate from (but excluding) the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to their issuance to (and including) the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.
Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360-days basis).
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) percentage units higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Trustee or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
Redemption and Repurchaseof the Bonds
Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Bonds in full on the Final Redemption Date with an amount per Bond equal to the Outstanding Nominal Amount of each Bond. If the Final Redemption Date is not a Business Day, then the redemption shall occur on the first following Business Day.
Issuer's purchase of Bonds
The Issuer or any Group Company may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds on the market or in any other way at prices aligned with current market prices of the Bonds (traded or quoted). The Bonds held by the Issuer or any Group Company may at such Group Company's discretion be retained or sold, but not cancelled.
