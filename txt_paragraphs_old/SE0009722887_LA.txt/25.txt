By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement.
Provided that (i) no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue and (ii) the Issuer meets the Incurrence Test, the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Bonds shall apply to Subsequent Bonds. The price of the Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal amount o f the Bonds (the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed EUR 150,000,000 unless consent from the Bondholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 17.5(a). Each Subsequent Bonds shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Bonds.
The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank (i) junior to the Working Capital Facility pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (if any) and for the avoidance of doubt, the Working Capital Facility Provider will have waterfall priority to any proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (if any), and (ii) at least pari passu with all direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law, and without any preference among them.
The Bonds are freely transferable but the Bondholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable, under local laws to which a Bondholder may be subject. Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about,
