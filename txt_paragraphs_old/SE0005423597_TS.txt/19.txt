(f) The Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu with all direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law, and without any preference among them.
(h) No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Noteholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Notes.
3. Use of Proceeds
The proceeds from the issue of the Notes, less the costs and expenses incurred by the Issuer in connection with the issue of the Notes, shall be on-lent from the Issuer to the SAS Consortium and used by the SAS Consortium to refinance outstanding financial indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.
4. Transfer restrictions
The Notes are freely transferable but the Noteholders shall comply with purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Notes, as applicable from time to time under local laws to which such Noteholder may be subject (due to its nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) for business or otherwise). Each Noteholder must ensure compliance with applicable local laws and regulations at their own cost and expense.
