(b) The calculation of the ratios in (i) and (ii) above shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no earlier than one (1) month prior to the event relevant for the application of the Incurrence Test. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include any new Financial Indebtedness incurred under any Tap Issue in respect of which the Incurrence Test is applied (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt).
(c) The figures for the EBITDA for the Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report shall be used for the Incurrence Test, but adjusted so that:
(i) entities, assets or operations acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Relevant Period, or after the end of the Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period; and
(ii) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from a Tap Issue shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period.
