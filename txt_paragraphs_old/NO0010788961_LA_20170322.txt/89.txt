SCHEDULE 3 SECURITY PRINCIPLES
(a) Security will be given by a Group Company to the extent such company is or becomes a Material Group Company, over such types of assets or asset classes provided as security under the Pre-Disbursement Security paragraphs (iii) - (vii).
(b) General statutory and customary limitations (e.g. financial assistance, corporate benefit and retention of title claims) may limit the ability of a Material Group Company to provide security or require that such security is limited by an amount or otherwise.
(c) Material Group Companies will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal prohibition or result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer provided that the relevant Material Group Company must use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle.
(d) Any assets subject to pre-existing third party arrangements which are permitted by the Finance Documents or any other contractual restrictions on assignments or absence of necessary regulations, registrations or similar, and which prevent those assets from being charged, will be excluded from any relevant security document but the Material Group Companies must use reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets if the relevant asset is material.
(e) Security documents shall operate to create security rather than to impose any new commercial obligations or restrictions on use of the assets in the relevant Material Group Company's ordinary course of business prior to an event of default (i.e. blocking, transfer of title or similar) and shall, accordingly, not contain additional or duplicate representations or undertakings to those contained in the Finance Documents unless required for the creation, perfection, effectiveness or preservation of the security.
(f) Guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of any company partly owned (directly or indirectly) by the Issuer or of joint venture or similar arrangement in which the Issuer, directly or indirectly, holds a minority interest.
(g) The Bond Trustee shall only be able to exercise any powers of attorney (including, but not limited to, in respect of voting rights appertaining to any shares) granted under any security document or have the right to receive any dividends if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Bond Trustee has given notice of its intention to exercise such powers of attorney, voting rights or dividend rights (as applicable), upon which such rights may no longer be exercised by the relevant pledgor.
