(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the enforcement rules in Clause 10 (Enforcement) of the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, the Agent is entitled to, on behalf of the Noteholders (i) by notice to the Issuer, declare all, but not only some, of the Notes due for payment together with any other amounts payable under the Finance Documents, immediately or at such later date as the Agent determines (but such date may not fall after the Final Maturity Date), and (ii) exercise any or all of its rights, remedies, powers and discretions under the Finance Documents. Following a demand in writing from a Noteholder (or Noteholders) representing at least 50.00 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such demand may only be validly made by a person who is a Noteholder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the demand is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Noteholders, be made by them jointly), the Agent shall take actions in accordance with paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, provided that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and provided that the enforcement rules in Clause 10 (Enforcement) of the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with.
(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Noteholders instruct the Agent to accelerate the Notes, the Agent shall, provided that the enforcement rules in Clause 10 (Enforcement) of the Intercreditor Agreement have been complied with, promptly declare the Notes due and payable and take such actions as, in the opinion of the Agent, may be necessary or desirable to enforce the rights of the Noteholders under the Finance Documents.
(d) If the right to accelerate the Notes is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of acceleration to be deemed to exist.
(e) In the event of an acceleration of the Notes in accordance with this Clause 15, the Issuer shall redeem all Notes with an amount equal to the redemption amount specified in Clause 10.3 (Voluntary Total Redemption), as applicable considering when the acceleration occurs.
