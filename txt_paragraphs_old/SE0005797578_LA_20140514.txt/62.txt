The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no other Group Company will, except for Permitted Loans, be the creditor of any Financial Indebtedness (other than Financial Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or to a wholly owned Group Company) or guarantee the obligations of any persons outside of the Group.
Listing of Bonds
The Issuer shall take all measures required to ensure that (a) the Bonds are listed at the corporate bond list on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, or if such admission to trading is not possible to obtain or maintain, admitted to trading on another Regulated Market, not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Issue Date, (b) that the Bonds, once listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable), continue being listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) for as long as any Bond is outstanding (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of

NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption of the Bonds) and (c) that, upon any Subsequent Bond Issue, the volume of Bonds listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) promptly, and not later than ten (10) Banking Days after the relevant issue date, is increased accordingly.
12.7
Disposals of assets
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Group Company will, sell or otherwise dispose of shares in any Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or that Group Company's assets or operations to any person not being the Issuer or any wholly-owned Group Company (with the limitation set forth in Clause 12.10 {Limitation o f transfers to Nobina BusCo), unless the transaction is carried out at fair market value and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction and provided that it does not have a Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, shares which have been pledged pursuant to the Share Pledge Agreements may, with the exception of pursuant to the Danish Restructuring, not be disposed of as long as such shares remain pledged.
Upon a permitted disposal of shares in one or several Group Companies, or of all or substantially all of the Issuer's or another Group Company's assets, or operations, where the fair market value of such assets disposed of exceeds, or during any financial year in aggregate exceeds, SEK 50,000,000, the proceeds from such disposal(s) (less reasonable costs incurred in connection with the disposal(s)) shall within twelve (12) months of the disposal(s) be used either (a) in the business of the Group or (b) to repurchase Bonds in an offer directed to all Holders, in which any accepting Holder shall be entitled to tender some or all of its Bonds to the Issuer and the Issuer shall be obligated to repurchase such Bonds on a pro rata basis in relation to the accepting Holders' level of acceptance (rounded off to an even number of Bonds, as appropriate). If any proceeds from such disposal(s) (less reasonable costs incurred in connection with the disposal(s)), have not been used in the business of the Group and/or for repurchases of Bonds within twelve (12) months of the disposal(s) (the "Remaining Amount"), the Issuer shall have the right and the obligation to repay the total Nominal Amount with an amount equal to such Remaining Amount. Any such repayment of the total Nominal Amount shall be made as partial repayments of all outstanding Bonds by way of reducing the Nominal Amount of each Bond pro rata. The repayment shall be made on the next possible Interest Payment Date after the twelve (12) months period of the disposal(s), and the Issuer shall give not less than twenty (20) Banking Days' notice of the repayment to the Agent and the Holders. The repayment per Bond shall equal the repaid percentage of the Nominal Amount (rounded down to the nearest SEK 1,000) plus (i) a premium on the repaid amount amounting to 4.00 percent, of the Nominal Amount to be repaid, or such lower amount as is set forth in the Call Option Amount for the relevant period, and (ii) accrued but unpaid Interest on the repaid amount.
