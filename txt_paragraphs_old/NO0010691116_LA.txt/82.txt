3 1 (50)
The Issuer shall at all times following release of the proceeds of the Bond Issue from the Escrow Account, maintain a minimum cash balance of USD 7,500,000 in the Liquidity Account.
(b) Charter Free Market Value
The Charter Free Market Value of the Vessel shall at all times exceed 125% of the aggregated outstanding amount under the Bond Issue (less any amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer on additional pledged cash accounts blocked in favor of the Bond Trustee, but excluding the Minimum Cash, being provided as means for reducing the net outstanding amount under the Bond Issue).
For the purposes of this Clause 13.6, "Charter Free Market Value" means the fair market value of the Vessel in USD determined as the arithmetic mean of independent valuations of the Vessel obtained from two independent and well-reputed sale and purchase brokers familiar with the market for such Vessel appointed by the Issuer and approved by the Bond Trustee. Such valuation shall be made on the basis of a sale for prompt delivery for cash at arm's length on normal commercial terms as between a willing seller and willing buyer, on an "as is where is" basis, free of any existing charters or other contracts for employment. The cost of such determination shall be for the account of the Issuer. The valuation shall be made at least semi-annually, or following an Event of Default, upon the request of the Bond Trustee.
