11. Incurrence Covenant
The Incurrence Test is met if, at the relevant time:
(a) the Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA does not exceed 3.50:1;
(b) the Interest Coverage Ratio exceeds 3.00:1; and
(c) the Equity Ratio exceeds 27.5 per cent,
calculated in accordance with the calculation principles set out in Clause 11.2 (Calculation Adjustments), on a consolidated basis and based on the most recently delivered Financial Report.
11.2 Calculation Adjustments
(a) The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than one month prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness or a distribution or loan in accordance with Clause 12.2 (Distributions). The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt).
(b) When the Interest Coverage Ratio is measured under the Incurrence Test, as applicable, the calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be made for the Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report.
