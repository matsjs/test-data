(v) any other information required by the Finnish Securities Markets Act (Arvopaperimarkkinalaki 746/2012) and the rules and regulations of the Regulated Market on which the Notes are listed.
(c) When the financial statements and other information are made available the Noteholders pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the Issuer shall send copies of such financial statements and other information to the Agent.
(d) The Issuer shall:
(i) in connection with the delivery of a Financial Report,
(ii) in connection with the incurrence of new Financial Indebtedness or a Restricted Transaction; or
(iii) within twenty (20) days from the Agent's request,
submit to the Agent a Compliance Certificate which, in cases (ii) and (iii) above, shall also contain calculations and figures in respect of the Incurrence Test.
(e) The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent (with full particulars) when the Issuer is or becomes aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of any of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.
(f) The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to this Clause 10.1 if informing the Agent would not conflict with any applicable laws or, when the Notes are listed, the Issuer's registration contract with the Regulated Market. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek approval from the Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to this Clause 10.1.
