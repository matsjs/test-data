(e) All payments to be made by the Issuer pursuant to these Terms and Conditions shall be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim.
(a) Each Initial Note carries Interest at the Interest Rate from (and including) the First Issue Date up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date. Any Subsequent Note will carry Interest at the Interest Rate from (and including) the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
(b) Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Notes shall be made to the Noteholders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
(c) Interest shall be calculated on the "actual/actual ICMA" basis as specified by the International Capital Market Association.
(d) If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (and including) the due date up to (but excluding) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) per cent. higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent, the Issuing Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
9. Redemption and Repurchase of the Notes
9.1 Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Notes in full on the Final Maturity Date with an amount per Note equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. If the Final Maturity Date is not a CSD Business Day, then the redemption shall occur on the CSD Business Day determined by application of the Business Day Convention.
