The Company and its operations
The object of the Company's business, which is set forth in paragraph 3 of its articles of association, is to explore for and exploit gas and oil and activities compatible therewith, either directly, through its subsidiaries, associated companies or other forms o f partnerships. The current articles o f association were adopted at the annual general meeting held on 25 May 2011.
Tethys Oil was founded in 2001, by Vincent Hamilton, John Hoey and Magnus Nordin and was awarded its first licence onshore Denmark in 2002. In 2003, interests in three Spanish licences were acquired. Subsequently, opportunities in Turkey were evaluated resulting in the signing of an agreement covering three Turkish licences in December 2003. A second Danish licence was awarded in 2003 and an application for an additional exploration licence in Spain was filed. Tethys Oil conducted an IPO in March 2004 and was listed for trading on Nya Marknaden (the predecessor o f First North) in Stockholm on 6 April 2004.
As a public company, Tethys Oil has participated in a number of projects and depending on results some licences have been relinquished and others have been added. In 2006, Tethys Oil acquired interests in Block 15 onshore Oman which covered the Jebel Aswad ("JAS") appraisal project. Following the successful JAS-1 re-entry well, Tethys Oil proceeded to strengthen its presence in Oman by the acquisition in 2007 of interests in Omani Block 3 and 4. As a result, the Sultanate of Oman has become Tethys' main theatre of operations.
