Risk factors
All investments in bonds involve a degree o f risk. The financial performance o f the Company and the risks associated with its business are important when making a decision on whether to invest in the Bonds. A number o f risk factors and uncertainties may adversely affect the Company. I f any o f these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the business, operating results andfinancial condition o f the Company could be materially and adversely affected which ultimately could affect the Companys' ability to make interest payments and payments o f principal under the Terms and Conditions. In this Section, a number o f risk factors are illustrated, both general risks pertaining to the Company's business operations and material risks relating to the Bonds as financial instruments. The risks presented in this Prospectus are not exhaustive, and other risks not discussed herein may also adversely affect the Company. Further, the risk factors are not ranked in order o f importance.
Prospective investors should consider carefully the information contained in this Prospectus and make an independent evaluation before making an investment decision. A potential investor must, alone or together with its financial and/or other advisors, consider the general business prospects, other information in this Prospectus and general information about the applicable market and companies active on that market, based on their personal circumstances before making an investment. An investor should possess sufficient knowledge to assess the riskfactors and sufficientfinancial strength to bear those risks.
RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY Technical and geological risk The main operational risk is that the interest the Group has in oil and gas assets will not evolve into commercial reserves of oil and gas. All assessments of potential oil and gas reserves are built on estimations and involve a certain degree of uncertainty. Every estimation of such reserves done by geologists is based on such factors as seismic data, loggings from existing drilled holes, extracted bore specimens, simulating models from computers, factual oil torrents and pressure data from existing holes, oil prices etcetera. Thus, oil and gas reserve estimates always change over time, to a larger or smaller extent. There is always a risk that the estimated volumes will not accord with reality. Estimates, presented in the Prospectus, are done based on data, which to date is available regarding respective projects and about expected oil prices. There are no guarantees that these estimates will not change over time as new data becomes available. The actual production and cash flow will therefore vary from the estimations and the variations may occasionally be large, which in turn could adversely affect the Company's financial position and results. Furthermore, probabilities that commercial oil reserves will not be found are highest before and during exploration drilling. Even when the presence of oil and gas reserves are established during exploration drilling, significant uncertainty remain as to when and how these reserves can be extracted. The estimated reserves will therefore be reduced to the extent these activities do not, fully or partially, reach the estimated levels.
General business risks The Group's business is exposed to all of the risks and uncertainties with which the business of exploration, acquisition, development, production and sale of oil and gas is associated. These risks cannot be entirely avoided, even with a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation. The risks and uncertainties normally associated with the oil and gas business include fire, explosions, blowouts (i.e. an

uncontrolled spillage of oil, gas or water from an oil well), sour gas emissions, burst pipelines and oil spills. Each of these risks may result in extensive damage to oil and gas wells, production facilities, other property or the environment, and may cause considerable personal injury. This may in turn result in extensive liability for damages and the like. Collection systems and processing facilities are also exposed to many of these risks. Each instance where there is significant damage to the systems and facilities on which the Group depends can have a negative impact on the Group's ability to sell the oil and gas it produces. The oil and gas business is also exposed to the risk of a premature decline in reserves for natural reasons or an inflow of water into producing formations. If any of the above risks and uncertainties should occur it may result in significantly increased costs and liabilities which in turn may adversely affect the Company's financial position and prospects.
Fluctuating production levels Exploration for and exploitation of oil and gas reserves may be delayed or negatively affected by factors beyond the Group's control. Such factors include unfavourable weather, climate or geological conditions, decisions taken or work carried out by partners or suppliers which the Group may be dependent upon now or in the future, accommodating governmental demands, problems or delays in installation and ordering of machinery and equipment, or delays in imports or customs clearance. Problems may also arise due to environmental problems, accidents, occupational and health risks, industrial disputes, locally acquired equipment being of poor quality or in poor working order, or disruptions in the supply of services and products such as electricity, water, fuel, transport, process capacity or technical support. This may result in failure to meet established production deadlines and/or lead to increased costs. Fluctuations that impact production at any of the Group's facilities may thus have a material impact on the Group's forecast production levels and therefore also on profit levels.
