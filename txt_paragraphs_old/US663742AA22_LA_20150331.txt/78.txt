Section 3.02 Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed or Purchased.
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form pursuant to Article 2 hereof, based on a method in accordance with DTC's (or any other applicable depositary's) procedures) unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or Depositary requirements. The Trustee shall not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this Section 3.02.
No Notes of $200,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption shall be given to each Holder pursuant to Sections 3.03 and 12.01.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. With respect to Notes that are held in certificated form, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes redeemed.
In relation to Definitive Registered Notes, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased or unredeemed portion of any Note purchased or redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. On or after any purchase or redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the purchase or redemption price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof tendered for purchase or called for redemption.
