(a) So long as any Notes are outstanding and whether or not the Issuer is then subject to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:
(ii) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an annual report that includes all information that would be required to be filed with the Commission on Form 20-F (or any successor form) containing the information required to be contained therein for such fiscal year; and
(iii) at or prior to such times as would be required to be filed or furnished to the Commission as a "foreign private issuer" subject to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, all such other reports and information that the Issuer would have been required pursuant thereto;
provided, however, that to the extent that the Issuer ceases to qualify as a "foreign private issuer" within the meaning of the Exchange Act, whether or not the Issuer is then subject to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee, so long as any notes are outstanding, within 30 days of the respective dates on which the Issuer would be required to file such documents with the Commission if it was required to file such documents under the Exchange Act, all reports and other information that would be required to be filed with (or furnished to) the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as a "foreign private issuer."
If required by the rules and regulations of the Commission, the Issuer will electronically file or furnish, as the case may be, a copy of all such information and reports with the Commission for public availability within the time periods specified above. In addition, the Issuer has agreed that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding, it will furnish to the Holders and prospective investors identified by a

Holder, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to in this Section 4.03(a) to the Trustee and the Holders of Notes if the Issuer has filed such reports with the Commission and such reports are publicly available on the Commission's website; provided, however, that the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such information, documents or reports have been filed.
