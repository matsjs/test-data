(g) If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules and regulations of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

Section 4.15 Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries.
(a) The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as Unrestricted will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.07 or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors of the Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
(b) If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Section 4.09, the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (i) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.09, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (ii) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Section 4.16 Conduct of Business.
(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in the conduct of any business other than a Permitted Business.
Section 4.17 Additional Amounts.
(a) All payments made under or with respect to the Notes (whether or not in the form of Definitive Registered Notes) or any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (i) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business or resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision thereof or therein, or (ii) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, without limitation, the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a "Tax Jurisdiction") will at any time be required to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:
