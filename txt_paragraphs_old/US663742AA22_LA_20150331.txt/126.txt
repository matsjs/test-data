require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the U.S. federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its members states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction) or (b) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
If on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under this Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 4.20(a) being collectively referred to as a "Suspension Event"), beginning on the day of the Suspension Event and continuing until such time (the "Suspension Period"), if any, at which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Rating from each Rating Agency (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of Sections 4.07 through 4.11, Section 4.15 and clause 5.01(a)(iii) will not be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants"). Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms on and after the Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the Suspension Period, and Section 4.07 will be interpreted as if it had been in effect since the date of this Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made during the Suspension Period. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Period will be classified as having been incurred pursuant Section 4.09(b)(ii).
Section 4.20 Maintenance of Listing.
The Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market and listed on the Irish Stock Exchange within a reasonable period after the Issue Date and will maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it can no longer reasonably comply with the requirements for listing the Notes on the Global Exchange Market or if maintenance of such listing becomes unduly onerous, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Global Exchange Market and thereafter, to maintain a listing of such Notes on such other "recognised stock exchange" as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.
