(f) modify any of the provisions relating to supplemental indentures requiring the consent of Holders of the Notes or relating to the waiver of past defaults or relating to the waiver of certain covenants, except to increase the percentage of outstanding Notes required for such actions or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Note affected thereby; or
Any amendment, supplement or waiver consented to by at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will be binding against any non-consenting Holders.
Section 9.03 Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date of the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
Section 9.04 Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Issuer, in exchange for Notes, may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate, or cause the Authentication Agent to authenticate, the new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
