Section 10.02 Limitation on Guarantor Liability.
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar national, federal, local or state law or voidable preference or improper corporate benefit, or violate the corporate purpose of the relevant Guarantor or any applicable maintenance of share capital or similar laws or regulations affecting the rights of creditors generally under any applicable law or regulation to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount (as may be set forth in a supplemental indenture to the extent reasonably determined by the Issuer) that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting either a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or voidable preference, financial assistance or improper corporate benefit, or violating the corporate purpose of the relevant Guarantor or any applicable capital maintenance or, in each case, any similar laws or regulations affecting the rights of creditors generally under any applicable law or regulation.
