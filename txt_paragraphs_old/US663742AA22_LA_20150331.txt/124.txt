(v) any Taxes withheld or deducted from a payment to an individual as required pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meetings of November 26, 2000 and November 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;

(c) If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 45 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 45th day prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such an Officer's Certificate, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no Additional Amounts are payable.
(d) The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will provide the Trustee with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of Additional Amounts. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will provide to the Trustee an official receipt or, if official receipts are not obtainable, other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will attach to each certified copy or other document a certificate stating the amount of such Taxes paid per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Upon request, copies of those receipts or other documentation, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the Holders of the Notes.
(e) Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
