For purposes of this definition, the "maximum fixed repurchase price" of any Redeemable Capital Stock that does not have a fixed redemption, repayment or repurchase price will be calculated in accordance with the terms of such Redeemable Capital Stock as if such Redeemable Capital Stock were purchased on any date on which Indebtedness will be required to be determined pursuant to this Indenture, and if such price is based upon, or measured by, the fair market value of such Redeemable Capital Stock, such fair market value will be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer of such Redeemable Capital Stock; provided, that if such Redeemable Capital Stock is not then permitted to be redeemed, repaid or repurchased, the redemption, repayment or repurchase price shall be the book value of such Redeemable Capital Stock as reflected in the most recent financial statements of such Person.
"Indenture" means this Indenture, as it may be amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time.
