(xiv) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness in respect of workers' compensation and claims arising under similar legislation, captive insurance companies, or pursuant to self-insurance obligations and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit;
(xvi) Indebtedness of any Person incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness incurred (A) to provide all or any portion of the funds used to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or (B) otherwise in connection with or contemplation of such acquisition); provided, however, with respect to this clause (xvi), that at

the time of such acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Indebtedness is deemed to be incurred, (x) the Issuer could incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under Section 4.09(a), after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction or (y) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction; and
(xvii) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness (other than and in addition to Indebtedness permitted under clauses (i) through (xvi) above) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, replace, refinance, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (xvii), not to exceed $100.0 million.
Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the obligation to pay commitment fees, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness or in the form of additional shares of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.09.
(c) The Issuer will not incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.
(d) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness in dollars where Indebtedness is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Indebtedness will be the Dollar Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided that if any such Indebtedness denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to dollars) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in dollars will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the Dollar Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness being refinanced was initially incurred, except to the extent that such Dollar Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Agreement (with respect to dollars), in which case the amount of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09, increases in Indebtedness solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies or currency values will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur under this Section 4.09.
