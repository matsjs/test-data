(including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change
proposed before and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the relevant Tax
Jurisdiction was not a Tax Jurisdiction on the Issue Date, the date on which such Tax
Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction under the Indenture).
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must remain in effect. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction, such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee, to the effect that there has been such change or amendment which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.
The Trustee will accept such Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.
For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meetings of November 26, 2000 and November 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.
