(ii) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld as a result of the failure of the Holder of the Notes to comply with any reasonable written request, made to such Holder in writing at a time that would enable the Holder acting reasonably to comply with such request and, in any event, at least 90 days before any withholding or deduction of such Taxes would be payable, by the Issuer to satisfy any certification, information or other reporting requirement, which is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction as a precondition to any exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction, but in each case, only to the extent such Holder is legally entitled to satisfy such requirements;
