(ii) such redemption occurs not more than 180 days after the date of the closing of the relevant Equity Offering.
(b) The Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of Holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Section 3.08 Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes.
The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in Section 3.03 and Section 12.01), at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of Holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is prior to the Tax Redemption Date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the Issuer is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Issuer cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the designation of a Paying Agent in another jurisdiction), and the requirement arises as a result of:
(i) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction affecting taxation, which change or amendment has not been formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the relevant Tax Jurisdiction was not a Tax Jurisdiction on the Issue Date, the date on which such Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction under this Indenture); or

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must remain in effect. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction, such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee, to the effect that there has been such change or amendment which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an
