(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause to become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
(ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;
(iii) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or
(iv) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;
provided that (A) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (B) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.
(b) Section 4.08(a) will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:
(i) the Notes (including Additional Notes), this Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities and the security documents related thereto or by other indentures or agreements governing other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer ranking equally with the Notes; provided that the encumbrances or restrictions imposed by such other indentures or agreements are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances or restrictions imposed by this Indenture;
(ii) any agreements with respect to Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to Section 4.09 and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that such encumbrances or restrictions are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Holders of the Notes than is customary in
