(b) The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Issuer. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee with 30 days prior written notice by so notifying the Trustee and the Issuer in writing. The Issuer may remove the Trustee with 30 days prior written notice if:
(ii) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
(iii) a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(iv) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.
(c) If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee, provided, however, that in case of a bankruptcy the resigning Trustee will have the right to appoint a successor Trustee within 10 Business Days after giving such notice of resignation if the Issuer has not already appointed a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Issuer.
(d) If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 calendar days after the retiring Trustee gives notice of resignation or is removed, (i) the retiring Trustee, the Issuer or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee or (ii) the Trustee may appoint a successor that satisfies the provisions of Section 7.09.
(e) If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.09, such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
