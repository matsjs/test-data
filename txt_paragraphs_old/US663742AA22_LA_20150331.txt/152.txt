(a) Subject to Section 8.06, all money and non-callable U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 in respect of the outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of the Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 8 to the contrary, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Issuer from time to time upon the request of the Issuer any money or non-callable U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 8.04 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.04(i)), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect a Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as applicable, of the type and scope originally effected by the Issuer pursuant to this Article 8.
Section 8.06 Repayment to the Issuer.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuer, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, interest or Additional Amounts on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal or interest (and Additional Amounts or premium, if any) has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on its request or (if then held by the Issuer) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter look only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may, at the expense of the Issuer, give notice to the Holders in accordance with Section 12.01 that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuer.
Section 8.07 Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any U.S. dollars or non-callable U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Issuer's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes and/or any supplemental
