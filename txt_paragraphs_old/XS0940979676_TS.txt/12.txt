The proceeds of the Issue have been used to repay in full the amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facilities, to pay fees and expenses related to the Issue and the Refinancing and will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of acquisitions from time to time. If we are unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, we may use all or part of the proceeds from the Issue retained as cash on balance sheet, together with other cash reserves, to fund distributions to our shareholders. See "Use of Proceeds."
As part of the Refinancing, we have entered into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which provides up to SEK550 million of senior secured borrowing capacity and will mature in 2019.
