The interests of our controlling shareholders may conflict with yours as a holder of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The controlling shareholders have (directly or indirectly) the power to, among other things, affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations and may have an incentive to increase the value of their investments or cause us to distribute funds at the expense of our financial condition, which could impact our ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, the controlling shareholders have the power to elect a majority of our board of directors and appoint new officers and management and, therefore, effectively control many other major decisions regarding our operations. We cannot assure you that the interests of the controlling shareholders will not conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes. See "Principal Shareholder" and "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions."
PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION
IFRS Financial Information
The Issuer, Bravida Holding AB (publ), was incorporated on April 10, 2012 in connection with the Acquisition Transactions (as defined herein). No financial statements of the Issuer are available prior to the date of its incorporation. Accordingly, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2012, this Prospectus presents the historical financial information for Bravida AB, the Issuer's predecessor, and its consolidated subsidiaries. This Prospectus presents the historical financial information of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2013. In addition thereto, the Issuer's audited financial statements as of and for the period April 25, 2012 ­ December 31, 2012, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Sweden as in effect from time to time ("Swedish GAAP") and the Issuer's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended 30 September 2013 prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards 34, Interim Financial Reporting ("IAS 34") are incorporated into this Prospectus through reference, due to requirements stipulated by the SFSA pursuant to the Trading Act but are not presented below in conjunction with "Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" or elsewhere in this Prospectus.
We refer to the periods for which financial information is presented for Bravida AB and its consolidated subsidiaries in this Prospectus as the "Predecessor periods" and the periods for which historical financial information is presented for the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as the "Successor periods." Due to the accounting impact of the Acquisition Transactions and other factors, such as increased interest expense resulting from the Acquisition Transactions, financial information in respect of the Successor periods is not directly comparable to that in respect of the Predecessor periods. See "--Impact of the Acquisition Transactions on Our Historical Financial Information."
In order to provide a meaningful comparison of our results for the Successor periods to those for the Predecessor periods, we also present in this Prospectus unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2012. The unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information represents the historical audited financial information for the Predecessor, as adjusted to give recalculation effect to historical income and expenses recorded by Bravida AB's intermediate holding companies (Bravida Installation och Service AB (formerly Bravissima Acquisition AB), Scandinavian Installation Refi AB and Scandinavian Installation Acquisition AB (collectively, the "Intermediate Holding Companies")), and by Bravissima AS and the Issuer, as well as the Acquisition Transactions, as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2012. The recalculation adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the historical financial statements which are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus. The unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information is presented for information purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations or financial condition that we would have reported had the Acquisition Transactions actually occurred on January 1, 2012, and they do not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period. In addition, the unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information presented in this Prospectus has not been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union ("IFRS"), and neither the recalculation adjustments to the historical financial information nor the resulting unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with applicable auditing standards. Due to the accounting impact of the Acquisition Transactions, particularly the adjustments related to acquisition accounting, and other factors, such as the increased interest expense resulting from the Acquisition Transactions, the unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information is not directly comparable to the Predecessor's historical financial information presented in this Prospectus. Although we present a comparison of the Successor's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2013 to the Successor's unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2012, these results are not directly comparable. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
