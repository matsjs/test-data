Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.
The Senior Secured Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Indenture.
Prescription
Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.
Currency Indemnity and Calculation of SEK-Denominated Restrictions
The euro and SEK are the sole currencies of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro (in the case of the EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes) or SEK (in the case of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes), whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount or the SEK amount (as applicable) which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).
If that euro or SEK amount is less than the euro or SEK amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Senior Secured Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantors' other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any SEK-denominated restriction herein, the SEK Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other than SEK shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-SEK amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.
