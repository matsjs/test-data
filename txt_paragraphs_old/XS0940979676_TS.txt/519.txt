To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Senior Secured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in SEK, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their SEK Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer Period"). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the "Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.
On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of 100,000 or SEK 1,000,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 or SEK 10,000 in excess thereof (as applicable). The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of 100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.
The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
143
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Limitation on Affiliate Transactions
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate value in excess of SEK50.0 million unless:
