Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the "EU Savings Directive"), a Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a paying agent within the jurisdiction of the first Member State to an individual resident, or certain entities established, in that other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The ending of such transitional period is dependent on the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories have adopted similar measures.
