The Intercreditor Agreement also provides for any credit facility constituting a "Credit Facility" under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the creditors of which are entitled under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Second Lien Debt Document to receive priority in respect of proceeds of the enforcement against the Collateral (each such facility being a "Credit Facility" and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities" and each finance document relating thereto, a "Credit Facility Document"). Each lender under a Credit Facility is a "Credit Facility Lender" and the liabilities of the Debtors to the Credit Facility Lenders are referred to as the "Credit Facility Lender Liabilities."
By purchasing a Note, holders of the Notes shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and Security Agent to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf.
The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the description that follows, defines the rights of holders of the Notes.
