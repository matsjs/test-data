supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction, including by way of prefunding) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.
Additional Guarantees
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any Credit Facility or any other Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Notes Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior Secured Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under "--Releases of the Note Guarantees." A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction, including by way of prefunding.
The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in "Risk Factors."
Additional Intercreditor Agreements
The Senior Secured Indenture provides that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "-- Limitation on Indebtedness" or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness" and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an "Additional Intercreditor Agreement") or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.
