The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, subject to certain limitations with respect to Security Documents governed by Swedish law, Norwegian law or Danish law, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the Notes. To the extent that additional indebtedness and obligations are secured by the Collateral, our control over the Collateral may be diminished. To the extent these activities are allowed with regard to certain security interests, under Swedish law and Danish law, such security interests could be considered not validly perfected.
The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

The same considerations also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.
There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the relevant Trustee.
Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, including:
· upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes;
· upon release of the Note Guarantee (with respect to the liens securing such Note Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);
· in connection with a disposition of Collateral to any person other than the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries if the sale or other disposition does not violate the requirements of the provisions set forth under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture;
