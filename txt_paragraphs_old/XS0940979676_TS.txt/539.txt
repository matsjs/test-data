the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to
the Senior Secured Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if
any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement
enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as
to any matters of fact.
Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness."
For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.
The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Senior Secured Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Senior Secured Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.
