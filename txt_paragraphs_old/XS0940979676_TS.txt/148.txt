 the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security;
 the relevant Note Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objective of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider; or
 the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Documents was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:
 the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;
 the present fair salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or
 it cannot pay its debts as they become due.
If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Note Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such Guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Note Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of the other Guarantors under any Note Guarantees that have not been declared void.
Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge, or in certain circumstances, a longer period.
