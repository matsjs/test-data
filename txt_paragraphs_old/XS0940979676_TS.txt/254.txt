In this section, we compare our unaudited interim income statement for the three months ended March 31, 2013 with our unaudited recalculated income statement for three months ended March 31, 2012. Our unaudited recalculated income statement for the three months ended March 31, 2012 gives recalculation effect to the Acquisition Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2012. Due to the effects of the increased borrowings to finance the Acquisition Transactions, our interest expense has increased significantly in periods following the Acquisition Transactions. Our selling and administrative expenses have also increased due to the annual management and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Acquisition Transaction and related transactions. As a result, the Issuer's results of operations on a Recalculation Basis for the three months ended March 31, 2013 are not directly comparable to the results of operations of the Predecessor for the corresponding period in 2012. The unaudited recalculated consolidated financial and other data for the three months ended March 31, 2012 has been prepared to give effect to the Acquisition Transactions in the manner described under "Unaudited Recalculated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information" and the notes thereto as if they had occurred on January 1, 2012. The recalculation adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited recalculated consolidated financial information and other data are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations or other financial information actually would have been if the Acquisition Transactions had occurred at any date, and such data do not purport to project the results of operations for any future period.
Net sales
Net sales decreased by SEK187 million, or 6.4%, from SEK2,916 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK2,729 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net sales in both our installation and services businesses, primarily due to a lower number of working days in the first quarter of 2013 because the Easter holiday occurred in March, particularly affecting our services business in Norway.
Net sales by business areas
Net sales in our services business decreased by SEK107 million, or 7.4%, from SEK1,444 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK1,337 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
Net sales in our installation business decreased by SEK80 million, or 5.4%, from SEK1,472 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK1,392 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
Net sales by geographic divisions
Net sales in our Sweden­North division were stable at SEK501 million for both the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2013.
