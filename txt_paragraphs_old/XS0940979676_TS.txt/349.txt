The Intercreditor Agreement also provides for any credit facility constituting a "Credit Facility" under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the creditors of which are entitled under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Second Lien Debt Document to receive priority in respect of proceeds of the enforcement against the Collateral (each such facility being a "Credit Facility" and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities" and each finance document relating thereto, a "Credit Facility Document"). Each lender under a Credit Facility is a "Credit Facility Lender" and the liabilities of the Debtors to the Credit Facility Lenders are referred to as the "Credit Facility Lender Liabilities."
Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of any Credit Facility, Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any Pari Passu Debt Document or any Pari Passu Debt Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.
