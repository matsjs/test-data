Costs of production decreased by SEK177 million, or 7.5%, from SEK2,358 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK2,181 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in activity, with net sales decreasing by 6.4% over the period, as well as to an increase in efficiency.
Administrative and selling expenses decreased by SEK58 million, or 12.7%, from SEK458 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK400 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to one-off recalculation adjustments relating to the Acquisition Transactions and to the implementation of cost saving initiatives throughout our business.
Operating profit
Operating profit increased by SEK48 million, or 48.0%, from SEK100 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK148 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to our focus on contracts with higher margins, our avoidance of high risk contracts, and our focus on controlling our costs of production and reducing our administrative and selling expenses, which resulted in improved margins.
Net financial expense
Net financial expense decreased by SEK277 million, or 81.2%, from SEK341 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013.

The tax income of SEK48 million was primarily due to higher financial expenses, which were generally deductible for corporate income tax purposes, as well as a reduction in the corporation income tax rate in Sweden, from 26.3% to 22.0%. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was 22.6%.
