the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Merger and
Consolidation--The Issuer,"
and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Secured Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness." In addition, the Senior Secured Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.
