Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.
The Senior Secured Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Senior Secured Indenture. The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.
The Senior Secured Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an "Initial Default") then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled "--Certain Covenants--Reports" or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Senior Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Indenture.
The Senior Secured Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction (including by way of prefunding). It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.
Amendments and Waivers
Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:
