Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control or a Sale
Upon a Change of Control or a Sale (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) the facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be cancelled and all outstanding utilizations and all outstanding amounts under any ancillary facility, together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) shall become immediately due and payable and shall be repaid within three business days of such date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ancillary lender or, as the case may be, the Issuing Bank (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) may, as between itself and the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, agree to continue to provide such ancillary facility or, as the case may be, letters of credit, in which case, after notification thereof to the Agent such arrangements shall continue on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the Finance Documents and save for any rights and obligations against any other finance party under the Finance Documents arising prior to such cancellation, no such rights or obligations in respect of the letters of credit or, as the case may be, ancillary facility shall, as between the Finance Parties, continue and the transaction security shall not, following the release thereof by the Security Agent, secure any such letters of credit or ancillary facility in respect of any claims that arise after such cancellation.
