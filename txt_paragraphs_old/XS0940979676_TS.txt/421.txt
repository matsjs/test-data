The Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes are not entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the Senior Secured Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.
In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes."
Enforcement of Security Interest
The Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. These limitations are described under "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement". The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of Senior Secured Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.
