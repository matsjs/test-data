Net sales in our Denmark division decreased by SEK116 million, or 7.6%, from SEK1,522 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK1,406 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to weaker demand, particularly in the second half of 2012, which was impacted by the downturn affecting Denmark. Prices were also negatively impacted by that downturn. Expressed in local currency, our net sales declined by 4% from period to period.
Costs of production increased by SEK592 million, or 6.9%, from SEK8,573 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK9,165 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased activity, as well as the lag between cost increases and the time when we were able to pass through costs to our customers.
Administrative and selling expenses
Administrative and selling expenses increased by SEK102 million, or 6.7%, from SEK1,531 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK1,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increased number of employees during the year.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses were SEK33 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the recognition of a non-cash loss on the sale of Aug Larsen AS, one of our Norwegian subsidiaries.
Net financial expense
Net financial expense decreased by SEK17 million, or 35.4%, from SEK48 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK31 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of lower interest payments.
