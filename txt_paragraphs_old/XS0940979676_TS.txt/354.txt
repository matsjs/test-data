Liability.
Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds from enforcement of the Transaction Security will be applied as provided under "--Limitation on Enforcement of Intra-Group Liabilities-- Application of Proceeds."
The creditors in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities (the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities, together, the "Secured Liabilities," and the creditors thereof, the "Secured Parties" and the documents evidencing the Secured Liabilities, the "Secured Debt Documents") may take, accept or receive the benefit of additional security and additional guarantees, indemnities or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of the Secured Liabilities, provided that, if and to the extent legally possible and subject to the agreed security principles, such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is also granted to the Security Agent as agent and trustee of the other Secured Parties. Any such additional security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss will rank in the same order of priority as referred to above and the proceeds of the enforcement of any such security, guarantee, indemnity and/or other assurance against loss will be applied as provided under "-- Limitation on Enforcement of Intra-Group Liabilities--Application of Proceeds."
The Intercreditor Agreement contemplates the Debtors (or any of them): (i) incurring incremental borrowing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities under; or (ii) refinancing (in whole or in part) the borrowing liabilities incurred under, the documents creating or evidencing indebtedness under or in respect of any Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes, the Second Lien Debt, the Hedging Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt or the Subordinated Liabilities (such documents or instruments being referred to collectively as the "Debt Documents") and/or incurring guarantees in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with any such refinancing which may, without limitation, be in each case implemented in whole or in part by way of debt exchange, noncash rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction (such incremental borrowing liabilities, refinancing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities being referred to as "Additional Indebtedness") which in any such case are intended to rank pari passu with and/or share pari passu in any Transaction Security with any existing liabilities and/or to rank behind any existing liabilities and/or to share in the Transaction Security behind such existing liabilities. The Secured Parties and the creditors in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities (the "Subordinated Creditors") (each a "Creditor" and collectively, the "Creditors") will confirm in the Intercreditor Agreement that, provided such financing or refinancing and such ranking and such security is permitted or not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, they will (at the Debtors' cost) enter into such documentation as may be necessary (including amending the existing Intercreditor Agreement or entering into a new, additional or replacement intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement) to ensure that the Additional Indebtedness (and the liabilities and obligations of the Debtors in respect of such Additional Indebtedness) will have the ranking permitted to be conferred upon it in accordance with the terms of the Debt Documents, provided that such documentation does not in any significant respect adversely affect the interests of any of the Secured Parties.
