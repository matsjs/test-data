The obligations and liabilities of each Guarantor incorporated in Norway (each a "Norwegian Guarantor") under the applicable Notes Guarantee are limited to the extent necessary to comply with the mandatory provisions of Sections 8-7 and 8-10 of the Norwegian Limited Companies Act (act of 13 June 1997 no 44), regarding unlawful financial assistance and other restrictions on a Norwegian limited liability company's ability to grant and/or honor guarantees, loans or securities in favor of or on behalf of the Issuer or its subsidiaries. The obligations and liabilities of each Norwegian Guarantor are limited to SEK5,000,000,000, plus any unpaid amount of interest, fees, liability, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Issue.
The obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Denmark (each a "Danish Guarantor") under the applicable Notes Guarantee are limited if and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory provisions, including, without limitation, (i) Section 206(1) (as modified by Section 206(2)) of Consolidated Act No.322 of 11 April 2011 on public and private limited liability companies, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the "Danish Companies Act") and (ii) Section 210(1) (as modified by Section 210(2) and Sections 211 and 212 of the Danish Companies Act) and, accordingly, will not include, and will not be or be construed as, an indemnity, guarantee or security in respect of (x) any obligations incurred or undertaken in relation to the financing of a direct acquisition of shares issued or to become issued by such Danish Guarantor or by a direct or indirect qualifying parent company of such Danish Guarantor ("Acquisition Debt") or (y) any obligations other than Acquisition Debt of a shareholder or parent company other than a parent company that is incorporated under the laws of any country covered by Executive Order No. 275 of 25 March 2010 on loans to foreign parent companies, as amended and supplemented from time to time. The obligations and liabilities of each Danish Guarantor are further limited to the amount equivalent to the higher of (i) its distributable equity on the Issue Date and (ii) its distributable equity at the time or times that payment is requested from it, save that these limitations will not apply to any obligations and liabilities of a Danish Guarantor in respect of proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Notes that are placed at the disposal of the Danish Guarantor by the Issuer by way of a loan or otherwise (other than as share capital).
The limitations set forth above apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by a Danish Guarantor pursuant to the Security Documents and to any guarantee, indemnity or any similar obligation resulting in a payment obligation and payment, including but not limited to set off or subordination, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or any other Transaction Document and made by any Danish Guarantor.
