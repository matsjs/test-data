the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security which the
Required Holders) are then entitled to give,
provided that if the Second Lien Debt Representative either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give such instruction, then either the Credit Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative may give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security as such Credit Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Pari Passu Debt Representative sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Second Lien Debt Representative and the Security Agent shall act on the first such instructions received from such Credit Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative.
The Security Agent may disregard any instructions from any other person to enforce the Transaction Security and may disregard any instructions to enforce any Transaction Security if those instructions are inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent is not obligated to enforce the Transaction Security if it is not indemnified and secured to its satisfaction (including by way of prefunding) by the relevant creditors.
Limitation on Enforcement by Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Noteholders
If either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representatives) wish to instruct the Security Agent to commence enforcement of any Transaction Security, such group of creditors must deliver a copy of the proposed instructions as to enforcement (the "Enforcement Proposal") to the Security Agent and the Creditor Representatives for each of the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Second Lien Creditors (as appropriate) at least ten business days prior to the proposed date of issuance of instructions under such enforcement proposal (the "Proposed Enforcement Instruction Date").
Until the Super Senior Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions (which for the purposes of this paragraph only, includes a failure to give any instruction by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), then the Security Agent will promptly notify the relevant Creditor

Representatives and such Creditor Representatives will consult with each other and the Security Agent in good faith for a period of not less than 30 days (or such shorter period as the relevant Creditor Representatives may agree) (the "Initial Consultation Period") from the earlier of (i) the date of the latest such conflicting enforcement instruction that has been delivered to the Security Agent and (ii) the date falling ten business days after the date the original Enforcement Proposal is delivered, with a view to coordinating instructions as to enforcement of the Transaction Security.
