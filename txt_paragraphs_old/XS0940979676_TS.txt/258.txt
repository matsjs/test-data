Net sales by business areas
Net sales in our installation business increased by SEK607 million, or 11.5%, from SEK5,279 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK5,886 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to stronger demand in our Norway, Stockholm, and Sweden­North divisions, driven by public-sector investment in schools, sports facilities, hospitals and infrastructure. Demand for large project orders increased, while demand for renovation projects remained stable.
Net sales by geographic divisions
Net sales in our Sweden­North division increased by SEK19 million, or 1.0%, from SEK1,970 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK1,989 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This slight increase was primarily due to strong continuing demand in northern Norrland, particularly in the mining industry.
Net sales in our Stockholm division increased by SEK272 million, or 14.5%, from SEK1,880 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK2,152 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to strong demand (particularly from the public sector) in the Stockholm region, where activity remained higher than in other more industryintensive regions of Sweden. A large portion of this increase was due to revenue from our contract with Facebook, pursuant to which we participated in the construction of Facebook's largest server hall outside of the United States.
Net sales in our Sweden­South division increased by SEK129 million, or 4.1%, from SEK3,138 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK3,267 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to certain major projects, such as the Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg and the Emporia shopping mall near Malmö, despite a weaker demand in certain industrial regions.
Net sales in our Norway division increased by SEK368 million, or 15.8%, from SEK2,328 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK2,696 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to stronger demand, both in installation and services, partly offset by some price pressure. Demand was positively impacted by the growing oil and gas industry, as well as general growth of the Norwegian economy, which was impacted less by the global economic downturn than was the European Union. Expressed in local currency, our net sales increased by 15% from period to period.
Net sales in our Denmark division decreased by SEK116 million, or 7.6%, from SEK1,522 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK1,406 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to weaker demand, particularly in the second half of 2012, which was impacted by the downturn affecting Denmark. Prices were also negatively impacted by that downturn. Expressed in local currency, our net sales declined by 4% from period to period.
