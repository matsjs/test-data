described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and
promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change in
auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.
In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not "affiliates" under the Securities Act.
The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Senior Secured Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer's website.
All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer's (a) total revenue or Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the most recent quarter for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.
