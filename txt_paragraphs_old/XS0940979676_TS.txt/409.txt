The Senior Secured Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Senior Secured Notes (the "Additional Senior Secured Notes"); provided, that if the Additional Senior Secured Notes are not fungible with the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code, as applicable, from the Senior Secured Notes. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness" and "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Liens"). Except as otherwise provided for in the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes issued in the Issue and, if issued, any Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Senior Secured Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this "Description of the Senior Secured Notes," references to the "Senior Secured Notes" include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued.
This "Description of the Senior Secured Notes" is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request.
The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note is treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders have rights under the Senior Secured Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.
