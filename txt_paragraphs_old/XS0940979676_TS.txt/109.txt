We are not presenting EBITDA and other EBITDA-based measures as measures of our results of operations. EBITDA and other EBITDA-based measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Our management believes this information, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. Our EBITDA and our other EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
(3) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as adjusted for certain non-recurring charges and costs identified in the table below.
