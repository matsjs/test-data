Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue is recognized in the income statement when it is possible to reliably measure the revenue and it is probable that the economic benefits will accrue to the Group. Our revenue consists of revenues partly from installation contracts and partly from service contracts. Revenue is recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method. This method is described below under "--Installation contracts." Interest income is recognized over the term of the loan by applying the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment has been established.
Installation Contracts
We apply the percentage of completion method to our installation contracts. Under this method, earnings are recognized in accordance with the degree of completion of the project.
Determining the earnings accrued at any given time requires information about the following components:
· Project revenue--the value of all revenues attributable to the contract.
· Project cost--all costs corresponding to the project revenues that are attributable to the project.
· Degree of completion--recognized costs in relation to estimated total project costs.
Expenditure that has been incurred during the year but that relates to future work is not included in project costs paid at the time of determining the degree of completion.
