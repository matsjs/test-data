· a turnkey installation contract for installation of all electrical, plumbing, HVAC, controls, sprinkler, elevator and cooling units in the new multi-sport facility in Gothenburg, Sweden;
· a partnering contract with NCC Construction Sweden, which we won in the Malmö region for electrical installations in central Malmö, including a mall, offices, apartments and garages, to be completed in 2013­2014; and
· a number of notable public sector projects currently in progress, including the installation of electrical, heating and plumbing, HVAC, and sprinkler and fire alarm systems for Norra Länken, Sweden's largest ongoing road construction project, which is scheduled to open in 2015.
Tender Process and Pricing
We obtain projects through competitive bidding. The process for obtaining business differs with respect to installation projects, on the one hand, and services assignments, on the other hand. The tender process for installation projects typically involves substantial preparation work, calculations, planning and negotiations with the potential customer. Depending on the size of the potential project, a tender process can last from a few days to more than a year.
By contrast, our services projects are typically based on framework agreements. During the tender process for services assignments, we work with the customer to detail items such as price, current organization, experience and availability. We are then usually appointed based on a weighted average of these items. Prior involvement usually offers competitive advantages.
Pricing for installation and services projects takes place at the local branch level, but pricing decisions are established at the group level. Factors that we typically take into account when pricing installation projects and services assignments may include: (i) the purchase price of materials; (ii) wages and hourly billing of project managers and employees; (iii) subcontractor costs; (iv) price differentiation for volume, geography or competence; (v) the fixed price of subscription agreements (in the service sector); and/or (vi) pricing adjustments relating to the economic cycle and general pricing adjustments.
Historically our customers have invited separate tenders for all electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC projects. Building services providers are engaged at a later stage of a project after the commencement of construction and the appointment of a lead contractor. As a result, pricing traditionally has been the primary competitive advantage of installation providers. However, we believe that the market has shown an apparent shift towards taking qualitative factors, such as integrated, energyefficient proposals and customer adaptations, into account. In our experience, an increasing number of construction firms have recently chosen to procure integrated solutions for all electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC installations directly from one provider, rather than through a construction firm that may employ several subcontractors, in order to achieve significant cost and performance synergies. This development has contributed to support our growth.
