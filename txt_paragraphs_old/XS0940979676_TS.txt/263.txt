Order Intake and Order Backlog for Installation Projects
We monitor our installation business through two metrics we refer to as order intake and order backlog. These measures provide visibility on our upcoming projects and operations, as well as an indication of our expected near-term performance.
Order intake increased by SEK249 million, or 2.2%, from SEK11,315 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK11,564 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to major installation contracts and strong performance in Norway. As of December 31, 2012, order backlog amounted to SEK4,809 million, compared to SEK4,590 million as of December 31, 2011.
Order intake increased by SEK714 million, or 6.7%, from SEK10,601 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK11,315 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to strong performance in Sweden and Norway, partly offset by weaker performance in Denmark. As of December 31, 2011, order backlog amounted to SEK4,590 million, compared to SEK3,840 million as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to a number of large contracts attributed to us in 2011, for example our installation contract with Facebook.
