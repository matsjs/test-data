All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
At any time that any of the Issuer's subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this "Reports to Holders" covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer. For purposes of this covenant and any calculation to be made under the Senior Secured Indenture, the Issuer may use financial statements of Bravida AB with respect to periods commencing prior to the Issue Date.
All reports provided pursuant to this "Reports" covenant shall be made in the English language.
