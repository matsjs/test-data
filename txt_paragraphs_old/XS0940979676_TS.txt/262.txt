Net sales in our Norway division increased by SEK37 million, or 1.6%, from SEK2,291 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK2,328 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased demand from manufacturing and housing projects. Expressed in local currency, net sales increased by 4% from period to period.
Costs of production
Costs of production increased by SEK368 million, or 4.5%, from SEK8,205 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK8,573 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased activity in both our installation and services businesses. Costs of production increased slightly more than net sales over the year, primarily due to the lag between the occurrence of costs increases and the time when we are able to pass through such costs to our customers.
Administrative and selling expenses
Administrative and selling expenses increased by SEK12 million, or 0.8%, from SEK1,519 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK1,531 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased activity in both our installation and services businesses. Our "Good Process" cost saving initiative helped to limit the increase of administrative and selling expenses to a significantly lower percentage than the increase in net sales over the same period.
Net financial expense
Net financial expense remained stable at SEK48 million for both the year ended December 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2011.
