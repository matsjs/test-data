Our employees are key to maintaining and growing our leading-market positions. We also intend to utilize our reputation, brand awareness and scale to continue to recruit and retain the best talent in the industry and to position us as the employer of choice. We intend to improve the performance of our managers and technicians by continuing to develop professional and technical training programs and by assigning our engineers and technicians to a wide range of fields. We also intend to continue to incentivize our managers and technicians by maintaining a performance-based compensation structure.
While we differentiate our offering by providing consistent, high-quality installation and technical services and offering a wide range of services to our customers, we believe we also are able to drive cost savings by standardizing, simplifying and sharing systems and best practices across our group. In order to continue to improve our margins and cash flow, we intend to pursue the following initiatives:
· Sales initiatives. We intend to focus our sales initiatives on cross-selling opportunities across the electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC fields and on increasing the total number of customers that utilize our installation and technical services offering.
· Cost-saving initiatives. Our competitiveness and long-term profitability depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to control costs and maintain efficient operations. We believe that we are well positioned to leverage our scale to optimize our cost structure. In particular, we intend to continue to reduce our costs by using our scale to negotiate volume discounts in supply chain sourcing and procurement, to focus on the disciplined management of our administrative costs and improve the efficiency of our workforce.
· Operational initiatives. We intend to focus our operational initiatives on developing local logistical capabilities in order to reduce onsite downtime, on effectively monitoring project costs and working capital requirements and on streamlining our operations across our network of branch offices. We recently completed an extensive diagnostic review of our operations and have identified several opportunities to improve operational excellence in these areas. We also plan to continue our strategy of rationalizing our operations that were loss-making.
Continue to Leverage Our Comprehensive, Integrated Offering
Many of our large customers are increasingly seeking providers who are able to operate in electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC, due to the technical complexity of the systems and cost pressures. Many customers are also making their purchasing decisions at the group level rather than on a facility-by-facility basis. This has resulted in a growing number of multisite contracts that require experience with different fields of technology, as well as the scale to enable the efficient management of complex logistics that are a part of large, multi-site projects. Our multiple locations and broad local network allow us to remain responsive to customers' needs, and to optimize our response to demand for increasingly complex installations. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these market trends, and that our wide range of expertise across various fields of technology, our technical and logistical expertise and our dense local network will continue to provide a "one-stop" installation and service offering.
Continue to Focus on Recurring Revenues
We believe that the diversity of our customers and our contract portfolio across our operating segments result in strong, recurring revenues, which help us withstand negative business cycles in any single aspect of our business. Under our business model, we avoid riskier, large one-off contracts, which we view as riskier than relatively small contracts for recurring services. We intend to increase our share of recurring projects with all of our customers by continuing to focus on small installation projects and maintenance service contracts. We intend to extend this strategy to the companies we acquire. We also plan to maintain a balance between our installation and services businesses and to continue to capitalize on our ability to provide add-on maintenance services following the completion of our installation projects.
