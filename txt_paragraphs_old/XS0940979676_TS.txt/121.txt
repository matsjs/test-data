You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this Prospectus before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and as a result you may lose all or part of your original investment. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Our business may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.
Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the Scandinavian, European and global economies. The demand for our services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly lower in an economic environment characterized by lower household income and corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business spending. Demand for our services depends in particular on spending in residential and commercial construction in the Scandinavian region as well as renovation and maintenance in industrial and infrastructure markets in that region, and a prolonged period of slow growth or economic contraction may reduce demand for our services. The level of activity in these end-markets depends on a variety of factors that we cannot control, including:
 local, regional and general economic conditions, slowdowns and recessions;
 the policies of the countries in which we operate, including the policies of the central banks of Sweden, Norway and Denmark;
 the policies of transnational institutions, such as the European Central Bank and other institutions of the European Union, which influence the performance of national economies in countries in which we operate; and
 the level of demand in construction and in manufacturing and process industries, demographic trends, capital spending and consumer confidence.
