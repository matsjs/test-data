· Under our Bravida Plus projects, we offer complete installation for large-scale and complex projects under a single, full-responsibility contract. By assuming full responsibility for the installation, we can optimize all project installations while carrying out each task in a structured and efficient manner. This integrated approach seeks to improve overall functionality and promote more-efficient energy use.
· On the services side, our Bravida Services Agreements comprise framework contracts under which we analyze and identify a property's specific requirements and produce proposals for short- and long-term improvements, as well as the regular service and maintenance of installations for the entire property. Our Bravida Services Agreement customers are typically regional or nationwide organizations whose operations are spread over a wide geographic area. However, we perform our work locally to ensure customers a single point of contact and competitive pricing based on local delivery of the service. Our local presence allows us to efficiently perform comprehensive analyses and comparisons showing our customers exactly where and how much energy they can save. Examples of the services we provide under our Bravida Services Agreements are: maintenance of HVAC installations, filters and grills; energy-saving proposals; regular inspections of fire safety systems; server monitoring and software update; water and sewage maintenance; boiler room inspection; switchgear inspection; lamp and light fixture replacement; the measurement and adjustment of pressure settings; and documentation and service reports.
Our Geographic Divisions
We operate in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, which accounted for SEK456 million, SEK132 million and SEK40 million, respectively, of our Adjusted EBITDA on a Recalculation Basis for the year ended December 31, 2012. We operate under five designated geographic operating divisions, which also constitute our primary reporting segments, and include: (i) the Stockholm division; (ii) the Sweden­North division; (iii) the Sweden­South division; (iv) the Norway division; and (v) the Denmark division. The chart below shows the distribution of net sales across our geographic divisions.
· Sweden­North division. In 2012, the Sweden­North division was our second most-profitable division, with an EBITDA margin 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Sweden­North division maintained on average 1,353 employees and, as of March 2013, maintained 48 branches. The Sweden­North division has experienced variation in demand between different locations and regions. Areas of strong performance include the industrial segment in North Norrland, which improved in 2010 and experienced strong demand in 2011, and public sector investments in the southern part of the division.
· Stockholm division. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Stockholm division maintained on average 1,326 employees and, as of March 2013, maintained 25 branches. Regions within the Stockholm division are organized by technical field (electrical, heating and plumbing, HVAC, technical service management and other specialist areas) rather than geographic region. Large, complex public and private investments are an important component of the Stockholm division's business operations and our major installation projects include civil projects, public transportation projects and sports arenas. Our competition in Stockholm consists of other national and international companies, who we compete with us for large, complex multi-technical projects.
· Sweden­South division. The Sweden­South division was our most profitable division with an EBITDA margin of 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Sweden­South
87
division maintained on average 2,289 employees and, as of March 2013, maintained 65 branches. Sweden­South division serves a mix of end-markets in cities such as Gothenburg and Malmö, which in 2011 demonstrated the strongest demand in our installation and services businesses areas, particularly in infrastructure and housing. In recent years, the division has also experienced stable demand, strong market shares and high margins from smaller towns where we have a strong local presence. The Sweden­South division has benefitted particularly from growth in regional mining, increased expenditures on energy investments and growing public infrastructure expenditures. In 2010, the division implemented a merger of the two regions comprising the Malmö region, which strengthened the division's position in the Öresund region. The division seeks to continue to strengthen its local presence through acquisitions in line with our growth strategy.
