(6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated, (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date,

provided, however, if the assets disposed of constitute Collateral or constitute all or substantially all of the assets of a Restricted Subsidiary whose Capital Stock has been pledged as Collateral, the Issuer shall pledge or shall cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to pledge any acquired Capital Stock or assets (to the extent such assets were of a category of assets included in the Collateral as of the Issue Date) referred to in this covenant in favor of the Senior Secured Notes on a first-priority basis.
The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes "Excess Proceeds." Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture.
On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds SEK100.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset Disposition Offer") to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of 100,000 or SEK 1,000,000 (as applicable) and in integral multiples of 1,000 or SEK 10,000 in excess thereof (as applicable).
To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Senior Secured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in SEK, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their SEK Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.
