Historically our customers have invited separate tenders for all electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC projects. Building services providers are engaged at a later stage of a project after the commencement of construction and the appointment of a lead contractor. As a result, pricing traditionally has been the primary competitive advantage of installation providers. However, we believe that the market has shown an apparent shift towards taking qualitative factors, such as integrated, energyefficient proposals and customer adaptations, into account. In our experience, an increasing number of construction firms have recently chosen to procure integrated solutions for all electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC installations directly from one provider, rather than through a construction firm that may employ several subcontractors, in order to achieve significant cost and performance synergies. This development has contributed to support our growth.
The terms of our customer contracts vary widely by customer segment and jurisdiction due to differing customer requirements and applicable industry standards. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the industry has established generally acknowledged and accepted industry standard contracts. Such standard contracts are available for a variety of different building, construction, installation and contracting situations.
· Sweden. In Sweden, our customer agreements in the installation business area consist primarily of construction contracts in which the purchaser is responsible for the overall project and the design and we are responsible for only the installation. Where the purchaser remains responsible for design of a project, we act as subcontractor and enter into standard subcontracting arrangements. By contrast, in "turnkey" projects where we act as a main contractor with principal responsibility for the design and execution of a project, our contracts will contain general terms that will allocate different responsibilities between us and the customer. Customer agreements in the Swedish services business area include individual services agreements for a fixed period, long-term framework agreements (with or without agreed volumes) and oral agreements (in daily operations).
· Norway. We utilize four standard-form customer contracts for installation projects in Norway, which are based upon industry standards for construction in the country. As in Sweden, these contracts vary depending on whether the purchaser or contractor is responsible for the overall project and design and on whether we are acting as a contractor or a subcontractor. We also have a standard framework agreement used for our services contracts in Norway.
· Denmark. In Denmark, installation contracts are similarly based on standardized agreements with standard terms and conditions that follow generally accepted industry terms and conditions. Services agreements cover the operation or maintenance of installations in technical systems, properties and infrastructure as well as ordinary services agreements, often for a fixed period of time. Some services agreements are made as framework

agreements in which standard terms and conditions are used, and other services agreements are very short and are not based on standard forms.
We also typically provide to our customers guarantee and support service coverage. A standard guarantee period for customer agreements for installation projects is five years on materials and workmanship from the date of acceptance and approval by the customer. Where applicable, the parties may sometimes agree on longer guarantee periods for special equipment. We often negotiate extension clauses in our supply agreements that provide a warranty period of up to 66 months (i.e., five and one-half years) where a purchase is made for an installation project. This ensures adequate back-to-back coverage during the standard warranty period.
