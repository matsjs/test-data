Net sales increased by SEK423 million, or 4.1%, from SEK10,345 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK10,768 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to a 10.9% increase in net sales from our services business, partly offset by a 2.1% decrease in net sales from our installation business. For the first time in our history, our net sales from our services business exceeded our net sales from our installation business.
Net sales in our services business increased by SEK537 million, or 10.8%, from SEK4,952 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK5,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. We believe this increase resulted from our focus on our services business, which we intended to grow to a level equal to or greater than our installation business and ultimately achieved this level.
Net sales in our installation business decreased by SEK114 million, or 2.1%, from SEK5,393 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK5,279 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily due to a general slowdown in the markets in which we operate, particularly in Denmark.
Net sales by geographic divisions
Net sales in our Sweden­North division increased by SEK140 million, or 7.7%, from SEK1,830 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK1,970 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to stronger demand from our manufacturing industry customers in the northern Norrland, and public sector investments and housing projects in southern Norrland.
Net sales in our Stockholm division increased by SEK40 million, or 2.2%, from SEK1,840 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK1,880 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to strong demand from housing projects and public sector investments, particularly in the first half of 2011.
Net sales in our Sweden­South division increased by SEK207 million, or 7.1%, from SEK2,931 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK3,138 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher demand, driven by infrastructure and housing projects and, to a lesser extent, offices and retail projects, partly offset by lower performance in the Jönköping region.
Net sales in our Norway division increased by SEK37 million, or 1.6%, from SEK2,291 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK2,328 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased demand from manufacturing and housing projects. Expressed in local currency, net sales increased by 4% from period to period.
Net sales in our Denmark division was generally stable at SEK1,522 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to SEK1,519 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net sales were negatively impacted by the weakening of the Danish kroner against the Swedish kronor, but offset by improved performance as the Danish market began to recover from the recession. Expressed in local currency, net sales increased by 6% from period to period.
