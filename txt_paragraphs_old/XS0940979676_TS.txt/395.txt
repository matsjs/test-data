Non-Distressed Disposal
In circumstances where a disposal of an asset of the Group which is subject to the Transaction Security is not being effected (i) by enforcement of Transaction Security, (ii) at the request of the Senior Secured Instructing Group or the request of the Second Lien Debt Required Holders (if the Second Lien Creditors are permitted to make such a request under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) after the Transaction Security has become enforceable or (iii) in the case of a disposal to a person outside the Group, after an Acceleration Event or an enforcement of the Transaction Security has occurred (a "Distressed Disposal") and is otherwise permitted or not prohibited (or has otherwise been approved) under the Credit Facility Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Second Lien Debt Documents (together the "Secured Debt Documents," and such disposal, a "Non-Distressed Disposal"), the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is irrevocably instructed and authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor (including, without limitation, any Secured Party or any Creditor Representative) or debtor of the Parent) (A) to release the Transaction Security (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shared assurance) or any other claims relating to a Debt Document over that asset; and (B) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release the Transaction Security (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shared assurance) or any other claim relating to a Debt Document over the assets of that Debtor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries and to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Transaction Security (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shared assurance) or any claim described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent (acting in good faith), be considered necessary or desirable; provided that if an asset which is the subject of a Non-Distressed Disposal is transferred to another member of the Group, the release of the Transaction Security must be permitted under the terms of the Secured Debt Documents and, to the extent that replacement Transaction Security is required from the transferee under the terms of the Debt Documents, such Transaction Security will (subject to any other requirements relating to the release, retaking, amendment or extension of the Transaction Security under the Debt Documents) be granted at the same time as (or before) the relevant disposals is effected.
If any proceeds from a Non-Distressed Disposal are required to be applied in mandatory prepayment of any of the Secured Liabilities or to be offered to any Secured Party pursuant to the terms of the Secured Debt Documents, then such proceeds will be applied in or towards payment of such Secured Liabilities or shall be offered to the relevant Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of the relevant Secured Debt Documents and the consent of any other party will not be required for that application.
