servicing of an entire property and span several years as opposed to taking a more reactionary approach to service and maintenance as they have done in the past.
Energy is typically the largest running cost in maintaining a property. Property owners are increasingly choosing to invest in energy-efficient installations in order to strengthen the environmental profile of the property and reduce energy costs. We expect that more rigorous government rules, regulations and directives regarding energy consumption will continue to drive the focus of the Scandinavian Building Services Market. For example, under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC) (the "2002 Directive"), the European Union aims to increase the energy efficiency of buildings. According to the Directive, the residential and tertiary sector, the majority of which is buildings, accounts for more than 40% of final energy consumption and 36% of carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union. The European Union's climate and energy objectives under the 2002 Directive include a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% increase in the share of energy consumption produced from renewable resources and a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. Buildings constructed after December 31, 2020 are required to consume almost no energy. On May 19, 2010, the European Union adopted the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2010/31/EU) (the "2010 Directive") which recast the 2002 Directive as the main legislative instrument to reduce the energy consumption of buildings. Under the 2010 Directive, Member States must establish and apply minimum energy performance requirements for new and existing buildings, ensure the certification of building energy performance and require the regular inspection of boilers and air-conditioning systems in buildings. Moreover, the 2010 Directive requires Member States to ensure that by 2021 all new buildings are "nearly zero-energy buildings."
