The margin on any cash advances under the Additional Facility Commitments will be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders providing the relevant Additional Facility Commitments.
A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit Facility from (and excluding) the Issue Date to (and including) the last day of the availability period for the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee will be payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which a lender cancels its commitment. No commitment fee shall be payable unless the Issue Date occurs.
Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.
The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement.
Guarantees
Each guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement has provided a senior guarantee of all amounts payable to the finance parties and the hedging banks under any secured hedging agreements by each other obligor (including any additional borrowers which accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and the hedging banks under any secured hedging agreements.
In addition, each member of the Group which becomes a material company (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) after the Issue Date (by reference to the most recent annual financial statements delivered to the Agent under the provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) shall be subject to, and on terms consistent with, certain agreed security principles accede as a Guarantor within 90 days of delivery of such annual financial statements for the relevant financial year (commencing with the financial year ending December 31, 2013) demonstrating that it has become a material company and shall grant transaction security over its material assets.
If at the end of each financial year (commencing with the financial year ending December 31, 2013) the Guarantors represent less than 85% of the consolidated EBITDA of the group or less than 85% of aggregate turnover of the group (subject to certain exceptions) (the "Guarantor and Security Coverage Test"), the Issuer shall ensure that within 90 days of the delivery of the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the relevant financial year such other members of the restricted group (as the Issuer may elect in its sole discretion) shall (subject to certain agreed security principles) (i) accede as Guarantors to ensure that the Guarantor and Security Coverage Test are satisfied (calculated as if such additional guarantors had been Guarantors at the end of such financial year) and (ii) grant security over its material assets.
