The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.
Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the Notes or the Note Guarantees. Accordingly, in the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our, the Issuer's or the applicable Guarantor's non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
For the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 on a Recalculation Basis, the Guarantors represented 93.0% of our consolidated net sales and 90.7% of our consolidated EBITDA and as of March 31, 2013 represented 91.4% of our consolidated total tangible assets. As of March 31, 2013, after giving effect to the Issue, the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the Notes would have had no oustanding long-term financial indebtedness. Any of the debt that our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees.
The Note Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.
The Indenture provides that certain Note Guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Additionally, in accordance with local laws, the Security Agent may not be able to represent the holders of the Notes in a court process without a specific power of attorney.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral granted by the relevant Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Note Guarantee or upon enforcement of the Collateral, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found that:
· the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security;
· the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document and the Guarantor or security provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;
