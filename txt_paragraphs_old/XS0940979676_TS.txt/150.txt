Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.
Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business.
Upon the consummation of the Issue, we had a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. On a Recalculation Basis after giving effect to the Issue, our total indebtedness (including the Notes) would have been SEK2,628 million (314 million) as of March 31, 2013.
Our significant leverage could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:
 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and liabilities;
 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of operations, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other general corporate purposes;
 increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business, or generally adverse economic or industry conditions;
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged as us;
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and industry;
