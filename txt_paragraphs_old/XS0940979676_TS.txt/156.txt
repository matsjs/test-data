The security interest in our assets serving as Collateral for the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof are also granted as collateral in favor of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging counterparties. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture also permit a security interest in such Collateral to be granted to lenders of additional debt and to hedging counterparties under certain of our hedging obligations. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the Security Agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedge counterparties and any additional secured debt, acts only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the lenders and the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility and the representatives of our hedging counterparties and any agent with respect to any future secured debt will have, subject to prior notification of and consultation with the Trustee, the right to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the shared collateral. In addition, holders of the Notes will not be able to force a sale of the Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security Documents without consulting the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedge counterparties and any such other secured debt for so long as any amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations or such other secured debt remain outstanding or as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other debt secured by such Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the secured creditors' recovery from an enforcement sale. Prior to enforcement of the Collateral by another class of creditors, the Trustee will be provided with notice and the right to consult. Neither the Trustee, the Issuer nor the holders of the Notes will have the ability to prevent or delay enforcement after the relevant consultation periods have expired.
The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that in the event that the classes of creditors entitled to provide enforcement instructions to the Security Agent provide conflicting instructions, such creditors must, subject to certain exceptions, consult with each other for a period of not less than 30 days following the earlier of (i) the date of such conflicting instructions and (ii) the date falling ten business days after the first enforcement instructions were delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, before any enforcement action may be taken. Although enforcement instructions given by the holders of the Notes will prevail after such consultation period (other than in the case that an insolvency event has occurred), if the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations have not been fully discharged within six months of the date the first such enforcement instruction was issued or if no steps have been taken in relation to the commencement of enforcement of the Collateral from the date that is three months after the date of such enforcement instruction (including any instruction not to take enforcement steps) then enforcement instructions by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and creditors under certain hedging liabilities will prevail. These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of respects and may permit the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and creditors under certain hedging liabilities to control enforcement in circumstances in which their interests are different from those of the holders of the Notes. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement." The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedge counterparties or any other future class of debt secured by the Collateral may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would not be advantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
The rights of the holders of the Notes to take enforcement action, including with respect to the liens securing the Notes, are limited.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, our hedging obligations and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the trustee or holders of the Notes to instruct the security agent to take enforcement action. The security agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that comprises (i) creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the indebtedness and commitments under any "super priority" credit facility, including the Revolving Credit Facility and the priority hedging obligations when entered into (the "Majority Super Senior Creditors") or (ii) the holders of the required principal amount of the then outstanding Notes as set out in the Indenture (or if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Notes), the non-priority hedging obligations when entered into and the holders of the required principal amount of the then outstanding indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes as set out in the relevant documents governing such debt ranking pari passu with the Notes (or if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding amount of such indebtedness) whose principal amount outstanding under the Notes and such indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes (the "Senior Secured Credit Participations") at that time aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the "Majority Senior Secured Creditors") (in each case acting through their respective creditor representative). If, however, before the super-senior discharge date, the security agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions from the creditor representatives then, to the extent the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors comply with the initial consultation requirements and the security enforcement principles, the security agent will comply with the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if the super-senior liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months of the date on which the first such enforcement instructions were issued, or no enforcement has occurred within three months of the date on which the first such enforcement instructions were first issued, then the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. If, prior to the later of the super senior discharge date and the senior secured discharge date the Senior Secured Instructing Group has instructed the security agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Transaction Security or the Senior Secured Instructing Group has not issued instructions, and the Senior Secured Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to

make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security which the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Additional Second Lien Debt Representative (acting on the instructions of the Second Lien Notes/Additional Second Lien Required Holders) are then entitled to give to the Security Agent under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, your voting interest in an instructing group comprised of Senior Secured Creditors will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.
Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy specified financial tests.
