The unaudited recalculated consolidated financial information is presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited recalculation adjustments are based on currently available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under circumstances and supportable. The unaudited recalculated consolidated financial information does not purport to represent what our results of operations would have been had the Acquisition Transactions actually occurred on January 1, 2012, and they do not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period. The unaudited recalculated consolidated income statements should be read in conjunction with the information contained in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto which are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus.
We have accounted for the Acquisition Transactions as a business combination in accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations under IFRS 3, and, accordingly, have recognized, assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Successor recognized goodwill as a result of the Acquisition Transactions, which completed on July 31, 2012. Our unaudited recalculated consolidated income statements reflect adjustments related to pension liabilities pursuant to IAS 19. The effects of the financing incurred in conjunction with the Acquisition Transactions have been reflected in the recalculated income statements as an adjustment to finance costs. The aforementioned adjustments have been offset by the related tax effects, as applicable.
