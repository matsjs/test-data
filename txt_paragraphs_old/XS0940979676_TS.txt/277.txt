Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to SEK11 million, compared to SEK7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and SEK4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our business is characterized by low capital expenditures, which represented less than 0.1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. We expect to make capital expenditures of approximately SEK10 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We plan to fund our future capital expenditures with cash from operating activities.
Working Capital Requirements
We do not currently have significant short-term or long-term working capital requirements, because we typically receive payments under our installation and service contracts prior to paying costs related thereto. These prepayment arrangements, along with personnel-related costs (primarily vacation salary), result in our negative working capital position.
Working capital requirements as a percentage of net sales was (3.7)%, (4.3)% and (3.5)% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
