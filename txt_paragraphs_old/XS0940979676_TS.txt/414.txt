"Determination Date" with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two Stockholm Business Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.
"Interest Period" means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include June 15, 2013.
"Representative Amount" means the greater of (i) SEK 10,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.
"Reuters Page Side" means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the "Interest Amount"). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes is permitted under any applicable law.
