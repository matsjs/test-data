The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to our Structure--The Note Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability."
