The following is a description of certain significant accounting estimates and assessments that have been made in applying our accounting policies. Percentage of Completion Accounting
Impairment Tests of Goodwill In estimating recoverable amounts for cash-generating units for the purpose of testing for impairment of goodwill,
several assumptions about future circumstances and estimates of parameters have been made. Changes in 2012 in the bases for these assumptions and estimates could have a significant impact on the value of goodwill. Pension assumptions
Management has assumed that the return on plan assets will exceed the discount rate by one percentage point, because this is the average return achieved over the last three years. To the extent that the actual return in 2012 deviates significantly from the expected long-term return, actuarial gains or losses could have a significant impact on the reported liability for defined benefit pensions. Similarly, deviations and changes to assumptions in respect of the calculation of the pension liability could have significant effects on the reported value of the net liability. Leasing
We lease a significant number of vehicles, mainly commercial vehicles. These have been accounted for in accordance with the rules for operating leases. Amendments to the accounting policies could affect the presentation of our income statement and balance sheet. Disputes
Actual outcomes for disputed amounts can differ from the recognized amounts, which are based on management's best assessment. Tax
Changes in tax laws and changes to practice in the interpretation of tax laws can have a significant impact on the size of reported deferred tax.
