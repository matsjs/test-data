Maturity and Repayment Requirements
The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of (i) the date falling five years and nine months after the Issue Date and (ii) the date falling three months prior to the earliest scheduled maturity of any indebtedness constituted by the Notes, the Pari Passu Debt and Second Lien Debt which shares in the Transaction Security (subject to certain exclusions including all hedging liabilities).
Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the Revolving Facility.
The maturity date for a facility under an Additional Facility Commitment is the date agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders providing the relevant Additional Facility Commitments. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed during the availability period for that facility, subject to certain conditions.
Interest Rate and Fees
The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the rate per annum equal to the aggregate of the applicable margin, IBOR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and mandatory costs (if any). The margin under the Revolving Credit Facility will initially be 4.00% for the first six months from the Issue Date. However, after this time, the margin on the loans is subject to a ratchet whereby it can be reduced or increased if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is (i) greater than 3.50:1 (in which case the margin shall be 4.00%, (ii) equal to or less than 3.50:1 but greater than 2.50:1 (in which case the margin shall be 3.75%) and (iii) equal to or less than 2.50:1 (in which case the margin shall be 3.50%).
The margin on any cash advances under the Additional Facility Commitments will be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders providing the relevant Additional Facility Commitments.
