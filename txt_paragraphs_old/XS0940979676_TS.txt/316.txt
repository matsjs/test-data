 security functions, including access control, closed-circuit television surveillance, and burglar and fire alarm systems, which can be integrated into automatic control systems;
 rail power supply systems, which comprise overhead lines as well as power substations where alternating current voltage is converted into 15,000 volt direct current voltage for rail traffic; and
 telecommunications and other light-current installations, including installations for telecommunications, radio and data communication systems.
Heating and Plumbing
Heating and plumbing installation and services, which comprised 27% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, or SEK3,065 million, consist of:
 water-based heating and cooling systems, which are used to provide heat through radiators or under-floor heating or to remove heat from components and industrial equipment;
 pumps, heat exchangers and boilers, which are required to heat rooms and tap water;
 district heating and cooling, which distributes heat or chilled water generated in a centralized location for residential and industrial facilities, which can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers;
 geothermal heating, which makes direct use of geothermal energy for heating applications, including borehole heat exchanges, which extract heat stored in the ground through a heat pump;
