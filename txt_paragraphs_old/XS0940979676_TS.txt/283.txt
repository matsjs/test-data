Internal Controls
Our Board of Directors acts as the ultimate source of internal controls. Our Board of Directors has delegated to senior management the establishment and implementation of a system of internal controls appropriate to our business. These controls include the safeguarding of assets; the maintenance of proper accounting records; the reliability of financial information; and compliance with appropriate legislation, regulation and best practice.
Our operations are decentralized. Management and administration are performed at the branch level by our branch-level managers at over 200 of our local branch offices in 150 locations throughout Scandinavia. Our branch-level managers report to each of our five geographic divisions comprising multiple regions. Each of our branches consists of, and is responsible for, one or
71
more profit centers. We characterize our profit centers as either installation profit centers or services profit centers, based on the predominant operations conducted by the applicable profit center. Branch managers report to our marketing managers at each of the five divisions and seek to maintain working relationships with local branches of construction companies, municipal authorities and local industries. Contracts with a value exceeding SEK50 million require approval of our chief executive officer. For a description of our corporate governance model, see "Business--Our Governance Model."
