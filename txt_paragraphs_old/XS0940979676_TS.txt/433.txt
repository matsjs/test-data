competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a
a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Indenture.
Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under "-- Selection and Notice." Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

Withholding Taxes
All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a "Payor") in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:
