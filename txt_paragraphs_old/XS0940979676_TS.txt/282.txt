Economic Activity
Tendering
A building services company is exposed to commercial and production-related risks, which need to be identified and managed during the tendering process. To ensure that this is done, we have implemented process descriptions and checklists that are aimed at identifying and pricing the risks in our cost estimates and tenders.
Capacity Utilization
Capacity utilization is heavily dependent on demand in our geographic markets. An unforeseen decline in capacity utilization generally results in a loss of revenue, which in the short term cannot be offset by a corresponding cost reduction. We seek to mitigate these risks through continuous resource planning and by employing subcontractors during periods of peak production.
Price Risks
Unforeseen variations in input prices and prices charged by subcontractors constitute a risk. We seek to offset the risk of rising prices through the use of contract forms that are appropriate for the project, indexation for fixed-price agreements and efficient purchasing procedures.
Insurance
We believe we have adequate insurance coverage for our operations, comprising liability, contract and property insurance.
