Upon a Change of Control or a Sale (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) the facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be cancelled and all outstanding utilizations and all outstanding amounts under any ancillary facility, together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) shall become immediately due and payable and shall be repaid within three business days of such date.
Financial Covenant
Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to comply with a Super Senior Leverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility and based on the ratio of consolidated total drawn super-senior facilities debt under the Revolving Credit Facility to consolidated EBITDA for the relevant twelve-month period) which must not exceed 2.5:1. The financial covenant will be calculated and tested on December 31, 2013 and quarterly thereafter (if any amount is outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the last day of the relevant period), in each case, on a rolling twelve-month basis by reference to our consolidated annual financial statements and our consolidated quarterly financial statements.
Events of Default
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for the same events of default (with certain adjustments as necessary) as under the Notes.
In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for customary events of default, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate, including: (i) breach of financial covenant (subject to certain equity cure rights); (ii) representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading when made or deemed repeated subject to a 15-business day grace period; (iii) cross-default; (iv) repudiation and rescission; (v) unlawfulness and invalidity; (vi) any failure to comply with a material term of, or breach of representation or warranty under, the Intercreditor Agreement; and (viii) cessation of business.
Governing Law
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it is governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law although the restrictive covenants, which are included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by, and shall be governed by English law).
