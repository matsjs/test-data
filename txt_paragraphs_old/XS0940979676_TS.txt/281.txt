Risk Management
We are exposed to various types of risks, both operational and financial. Operational risks are associated with day-today operations relating to economic activity, tendering, capacity utilization, price risks and revenue recognition. Financial risks arise from the amount of capital tied up and our capital requirements. We believe we are exposed to greater operational risks than financial risks.
Financial Risk Management
In our installation business risks are asymmetric. In any given project, the chances of exceeding the expected outcome during the term of the project are limited while there is a risk of incurring significant losses in relation to the size of the project. The management of operational risks is a continuous process covering a large number of ongoing projects and service assignments. We have designed standardized methods to ensure that operational risks remain under control. We believe our systematic work on quality and environmental issues as well as occupational health and safety issues are key building blocks that underpin our management system. Our financial risks are managed centrally for the purpose of minimizing and controlling our risk exposure while credit risks are managed locally at each of our profit centers.
Operational Risks
Economic Activity
Fluctuations in the economy affect the building services sector, which is sensitive to market fluctuations and political decisions that can have an impact on demand for residential and commercial new builds and investments in industry and the public sector. Demand for service and maintenance work is less sensitive to fluctuations in the economy.
