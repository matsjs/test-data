Tax on profit for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased by SEK67 million from a tax benefit recognised of SEK48 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to a tax expense of SEK19 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The tax income of SEK48 million was primarily due to higher financial expenses, which were generally deductible for corporate income tax purposes, as well as a reduction in the corporation income tax rate in Sweden, from 26.3% to 22.0%. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was 22.6%.
Profit/loss for the period increased by SEK258 million, from a loss of SEK193 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to a profit of SEK65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the one-off impact of the Acquisition Transactions.
Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2011
In this section, we compare the income statement of Bravida AB for the year ended December 31, 2012 with the income statement of Bravida AB for the year ended December 31, 2011. Due to the effects of increased borrowings to finance the Acquisition Transactions, our interest expense increased significantly in periods following the Acquisition Transactions. Our selling and administrative expenses also increased due to the annual management and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Acquisition Transactions and related transactions. As a result, the Issuer's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 differ from the results of operation of Bravida AB. For a presentation of the Issuer's recalculated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2012, see "Unaudited Recalculated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information."
