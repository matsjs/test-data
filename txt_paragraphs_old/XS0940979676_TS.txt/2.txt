Forward-looking statements
The Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements that reflect the Issuer's current views or expectations with respect to future events and financial and operational performance. The words "intend", "estimate", "expect", "may", "plan", "anticipate" or similar expressions regarding indications or forecasts of future developments or trends, which are not statements based on historical facts, constitute forward-looking information. Although the Issuer believes that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions and expectations, the Issuer cannot give any assurances that such statements will materialise. Because these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, the outcome could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statement.
Factors that could cause the Issuer's actual operations, result or performance to differ from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in "Risk Factors". The forward-looking statements included in this Prospectus apply only to the date of the Prospectus. The Issuer undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. Any subsequent forward-looking information that can be ascribed to the Issuer or persons acting on the Issuer behalf is subject to the reservations in or referred to in this section.
