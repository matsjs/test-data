 difficulties in coordinating projects across multiple regions, and staffing and managing foreign operations;
 the imposition of or increases in customs duties and other tariffs;
 increased costs of providing customer support for our projects in multiple languages;
 the imposition of or increases in investment or trade restrictions or trade sanctions;
 the interruption of transportation flow for delivery of products to us and services by us to our end-market consumers;
 currency devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
 the inability to definitively determine or satisfy local, regional and national legal requirements, the inability to effectively enforce contract or legal rights and the inability to obtain complete financial or other information under local legal, judicial, regulatory, disclosure and other systems; and
 the nationalization or expropriation of assets, and other risks which could result from a change in government or government policy, or from other political, social or economic instability.
We cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on us or that we would be able to mitigate such material adverse effects in the future. In addition to the factors noted above, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by inflation, deflation and stagflation in each country in which we have facilities. We cannot assure you that future increases in our costs will not exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts, if any, by which we may be able to increase prices for our products.
