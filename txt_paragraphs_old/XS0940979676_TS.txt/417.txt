The obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Denmark (each a "Danish Guarantor") under the applicable Notes Guarantee are limited if and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory provisions, including, without limitation, (i) Section 206(1) (as modified by Section 206(2)) of Consolidated Act No.322 of 11 April 2011 on public and private limited liability companies, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the "Danish Companies Act") and (ii) Section 210(1) (as modified by Section 210(2) and Sections 211 and 212 of the Danish Companies Act) and, accordingly, will not include, and will not be or be construed as, an indemnity, guarantee or security in respect of (x) any obligations incurred or undertaken in relation to the financing of a direct acquisition of shares issued or to become issued by such Danish Guarantor or by a direct or indirect qualifying parent company of such Danish Guarantor ("Acquisition Debt") or (y) any obligations other than Acquisition Debt of a shareholder or parent company other than a parent company that is incorporated under the laws of any country covered by Executive Order No. 275 of 25 March 2010 on loans to foreign parent companies, as amended and supplemented from time to time. The obligations and liabilities of each Danish Guarantor are further limited to the amount equivalent to the higher of (i) its distributable equity on the Issue Date and (ii) its distributable equity at the time or times that payment is requested from it, save that these limitations will not apply to any obligations and liabilities of a Danish Guarantor in respect of proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Notes that are placed at the disposal of the Danish Guarantor by the Issuer by way of a loan or otherwise (other than as share capital).
As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013, the Initial Guarantors accounted for 91.4% of the consolidated total tangible assets, 93.0% of the consolidated net sales and 90.7% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group. For information on the calculation of the figures contained in this paragraph, see "Presentation of Information."
Each Notes Guarantee is limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Structure--The Notes Guarantee and security interests on the Collatoral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability".
A substantial portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through their Restricted Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors). As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2012, net sales, EBITDA and tangible assets of our subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Notes represented 7.0%, 9.3% and 8.6% of the consolidated net sales, consolidated EBITDA and consolidated total tangible assets of the Group, respectively. Although the Senior Secured Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Secured Indenture does not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured Indenture. See "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness." As of March 31, 2013, after giving recalculation effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had SEK2,628 million of Indebtedness, all of which would have been represented by the Senior Secured Notes. As of March 31, 2013, after giving effect to the Issue, the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes would have had no outstanding long-term financial indebtedness. In addition, there would have been SEK550 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Notes Guarantees Release
The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:
· a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or other disposition
