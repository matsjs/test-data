We make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent, who makes payments as directed by the Common Depositary to Euroclear and Clearstream, which distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. We make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Withholding Taxes." If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Withholding Taxes," we pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.
