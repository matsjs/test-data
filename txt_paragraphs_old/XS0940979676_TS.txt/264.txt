Order intake increased by SEK714 million, or 6.7%, from SEK10,601 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK11,315 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to strong performance in Sweden and Norway, partly offset by weaker performance in Denmark. As of December 31, 2011, order backlog amounted to SEK4,590 million, compared to SEK3,840 million as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to a number of large contracts attributed to us in 2011, for example our installation contract with Facebook.
"Liquidity" describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including but not limited to working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by cash generated from our operating activities and our third-party financings. Our primary uses of liquidity are to meet our debt service obligations, to fund acquisitions and to fund capital expenditures.
Following the Issue and the application of the proceeds therefrom, our debt service obligations consist primarily of interest payments on the Notes and principal and interest payments on amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to fund acquisitions in the future primarily through drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and with cash generated by our operations. We expect to fund capital expenditures primarily with cash generated by our operations. Although we believe that our expected cash flow from operating activities, together with available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs, including our debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or on our other debt when due. If our cash flow from operating activities is lower than expected, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictions in the instruments governing our debt and our general financial performance. See "Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Financial Profile--Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business" and "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Financial Profile--We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful."
