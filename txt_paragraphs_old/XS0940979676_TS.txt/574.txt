(10) as provided in "--Certain Covenants--Additional Intercreditor Agreements."
The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Secured Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
Acts by Holders
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.
Defeasance
The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture ("legal defeasance") and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Notes Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).
The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors' obligations under the covenants described under "Certain Covenants" (other than clauses (1) and (2) under each of "--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation--The Issuer") and "Change of Control" and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under "Events of Default" above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and the Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under "--Events of Default" ("covenant defeasance").
The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenants described under "-- Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation--The Issuer", (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under "--Events of Default."
In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:
