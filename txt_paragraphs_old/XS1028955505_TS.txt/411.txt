Additional Guarantees
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any Credit Facility or any other Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee could give rise to or result in:
(1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary (including ``whitewash'' or similar procedures);
(2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or
(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) to the extent such cost, expense, liability or obligation is disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the Holders with respect to the receipt of the guarantee (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); provided that this clause (3) shall not be applicable to reasonable out of pocket expenses;
