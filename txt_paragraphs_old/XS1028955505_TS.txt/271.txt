· other significant environmental pollution or risk thereof;
· deterioration of special natural conditions or risk to water supply or other potential use important to the public interest in the operation's area of impact; and
· an unreasonable burden to adjacent or nearby properties.
Nature conservation requirements, such as the conservation of species, must also be taken into account in the consideration of the permit. In addition, an environmental permit may not be granted if the planned project is contrary to a local detailed plan (being a form of land use plan). The current and future purpose of land use as indicated in a valid land use plan is hence assessed as part of the consideration of a permit application, and may affect the granting of a permit and the permit conditions.

Permit conditions regarding the prevention of pollution and emission thresholds are based on ``best available techniques.'' Permit conditions for existing operations will be required to be updated in accordance with any new, more stringent, standards that are promulgated. However, the permit authorities, in accordance with their discretionary powers, usually require old facilities to fulfill new standards only after certain transition periods, which can be flexible. The anticipated production amounts are described in environmental permit applications and repeated in permit decisions. If we increase our earlier notified production levels or waste or emission levels we will need to apply for a new environmental permit or a change to the current permit.
In January 2011, the IED, which repealed the IPPC Directive and requires best available techniques ("BATs") to control emission levels, and sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities and includes rules aimed at reducing emissions into the air, water and land, entered into force. The IED also aims to prevent the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall environmental protection. The mineral industry (production of mineral fibers), the chemical industry and the waste management industry, among others, will potentially need to make changes to their operations in order to comply with the new obligations deriving from the IED. The IED is not applicable to mining operations, however.
Member States were required to implement the IED through national legislation by January 7, 2013. However, the implementation of the IED is currently ongoing in Finland. The IED is to be implemented by a revision of the Finnish Environmental Protection Act, which is ongoing, and the new act is expected to enter into force during 2014. The new act will replace and repeal the earlier Finnish Environmental Protection Act. Upon the entry into force of the new act, permit conditions will be required to be based upon the ``BAT conclusions'' set out in the BAT reference documents ("BREFs"). At that time, existing permits that are not in compliance with such standard will not be grandfathered in but will be adjusted with respect to the new standard. According to the current legislative draft of the Finnish Environmental Protection Act, the new BAT conclusions will be included in existing environmental permits through a permit review procedure and, as a general rule, implemented within four years from the publishing of the BREFs by the Commission.
All our production plants have in the past emitted, and will continue to emit, dust, odors, and hazardous and non-hazardous substances into the air, caused and will continue to cause noise, handled and stored and will continue to handle and store chemicals and hazardous substances, and generated and will continue to generate waste. We re-use process water at our facilities in large amounts. The process water loop is therefore as a rule closed and our waste water discharges to surface waters and sewers are correspondingly limited. No waste water is as a starting point discharged to ground water at our Finnish facilities. Therefore, we do not regularly discharge process waste water. Sanitary waste water is discharged to the municipal sewers. The quarrying operations do not generate any waste water. Our air emissions originate mainly from the melting, spinning and curing processes. Our most significant air emissions include particulates, sulfur oxide, phenol, formaldehyde and ammonia.
