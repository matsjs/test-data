The classification is based on IFRS 7 guidance, according to which level 1 instruments are traded in active markets and their fair values are based on market quotations. The fair values of level 2 instruments are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. The fair values of level 3 instruments are based on non-observable market data.
Available-for-sale financial assets cannot be measured at fair value, as fair values are not available, and are classified as level 3 instruments. The carrying amount is the management's best estimate of the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets.
