As a result of the Lappeenranta plant closure decision, one production line in Lappeenranta has been shut down at the end of February 2014. The closure of the production line did not have a material impact on the Group's production process as corresponding production volumes were allocated to Paroc's other production facilities.
Paroc Oy Ab (1749613-7) was demerged on February 28, 2014 into Paroc Sound IPCo 41523 Oy (2576449-6) and into established Paroc Oy Ab (2580556-9). Paroc Sverige AB (556688-7161) will be demerged into Paroc Sound HoldCo 41524 AB (556946-5700) and a new established Paroc Sverige AB. When the demerger process is complete a cross-border merger of Paroc Sound HoldCo 41524 AB into Paroc Group Oy will take place. After that Paroc Sound IPCo 41523 Oy will be merged into Paroc Group Oy. We expect the restructuring process to be completed in May 2014.
Preliminary ruling for the reorganization has been received from the Finnish tax authorities. The preliminary ruling for the transfer pricing methodology, whereby Paroc Group Oy would charge a concept fee to other Paroc Group companies, was also granted. However any specific pricing suggested was not approved.
On this basis the reorganization was decided to be done by transferring Paroc Group's intellectual property including patents, connected functions and the Paroc brand, initially held by Paroc Oy Ab, to Paroc Group Oy. A final decision on whether to adopt a concept fee model has not been done. Anticipated result of the restructuring is a more tax efficient position going forward.
