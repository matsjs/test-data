Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, include among others buildings and infrastructure, machinery and equipment used in the production and vehicles, are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses Acquisition cost includes all costs necessary to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. This includes the asset's original purchase price, costs of site preparation, delivery and handling, installation, related professional fees for architects and engineers, and in case the entity incurs an obligation to dismantle and remove the asset and restore the site on which it is located, the estimated cost of meeting this obligation. General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives. Land is not depreciated, with the exception of asphalting and other infrastructure costs.
