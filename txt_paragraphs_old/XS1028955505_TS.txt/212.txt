The insulation industry is an integral part of the construction industry and is thus directly affected by developments and changes in activity in the construction sector. Several macroeconomic factors influence the size and growth of the construction industry, including changes in GDP growth rates, changes in household income and inflation, business cycles, government debt, the availability of credit for potential home owners and investors, tax incentives and subsidies, interest rate levels, the state of the housing market and demographic trends. Historically, levels of construction output have demonstrated a strong correlation with general economic growth: during periods of GDP growth, construction output generally increases and during periods of stagnating or decreasing GDP, construction output decreases. Because we also operate in the technical insulation sector, we are also affected by developments in the wider industrials sector which is correlated to industrial production growth and in turn to GDP growth. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Difficult conditions in the general economy and the global financial markets may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the majority of our sales are concentrated in a limited number of markets'' and "-- The construction industry is cyclical in nature and subject to seasonality. ''
We therefore believe that our industry as a whole and our end markets in particular stand to benefit from a favorable long-term regulatory environment in the medium-term, driven by a Europe-wide governmental commitment to improve energy efficiency standards and reduce energy consumption and cost, which should lead to an increase in the intensity of insulation use. We believe that insulation is viewed by regulators as a relatively simple and impactful way to achieve these objectives, given that: (i) several recent market studies have concluded that buildings represent around 40% of energy consumption in the European Union, providing a significant opportunity to reduce energy consumption; and (ii) improving insulation has been demonstrated as one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce CO2 emissions through reduced energy consumption, with a marginal cost of CO2 abatement significantly lower than other energyefficiency initiatives.
Building Insulation Industry
Market Size and Growth
For the 19 countries reviewed by Euroconstruct (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) (the ``EC-19 Countries"), the 2013 market volume for residential construction is estimated to have been 583.0 billion, with 227.2 billion for new construction, while the market volume for non-residential construction is estimated to have been 417.0 billion, with 214.6 billion for new construction.
The development of the market for building insulation is linked to the level of construction activity which has historically been linked to general economic growth. However, residential and non-residential construction activities may decrease earlier in general economic downturns and may also experience cyclical recoveries with some delay. Historically, cycles in major geographic markets have not occurred in parallel as a result of which manufacturers of building materials active in different geographic markets have, to a certain degree, benefited from offsetting effects.
In the cyclical development of the construction industry, 2007 represented the end of an extended period of growth that peaked in 2006, when construction in Europe grew faster than GDP for that year (3.8% in construction compared against 3.1% in GDP growth), according to Euroconstruct.
Though the total construction output has generally decreased year-on-year since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 (with the exception of 2011), Euroconstruct forecasts indicate that this trend is expected to
