Summary Financial and Operating Information
The summary consolidated financial position information presented below as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 and the consolidated statement of income and cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
This offering memorandum presents certain unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information that has been adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma financial information presented herein is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from actual amounts. The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information presented herein has been included for informational purposes only, and does not purport to present what our results would actually have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2013 for purposes of pro forma statement of financial position information or January 1, 2013 for purposes of pro forma statement of income information, nor is it necessarily indicative of our results that may be achieved in the future.
Historically, we have not been required under IFRS to present segment information in our audited consolidated financial statements. However, in connection with the Offering, we have adopted segment reporting going forward and therefore we have presented certain segment information herein for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.
For these purposes, our three segments under IFRS are:
· Insulation, which corresponds to our BI division and TI division;
· Panel System, which corresponds to our PPS division; and
· Base Production, which corresponds to our Base Production division.
We also present in this offering memorandum certain eliminations and allocations, which provide for eliminations in respect of intercompany trading and other transactions between our operating divisions, as well as allocation of central overhead and management charges among our operating divisions, for purposes of Group consolidation.
