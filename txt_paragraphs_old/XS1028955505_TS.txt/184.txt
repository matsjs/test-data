Insulation
Building Insulation revenue increased by 3.7% from 248.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 257.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, despite a decline in volumes due to challenging market and economic conditions in several key markets, primarily as a result of budgeted price increases implemented during the year and foreign exchange translation gains.
Technical Insulation revenue increased by 10.4% from 130.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 144.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of improvements being made with respect to product mix as part of our continued focus on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products, price increases being implemented during the year and volume growth fuelled by expansion into new markets in Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland during the year.
Panel System
Revenue for our Panel System reporting segment increased by 15.8% from 51.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 59.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in volumes driven by a rise in the level of market activity, particularly in Sweden and Norway, where increased sales also benefited from foreign exchange translation gains, together with an increase in prices.
Cost of sales
Our cost of sales increased by 3.1% from 309.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 318.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, largely as a result of higher volumes. However, the rate of increase in cost of sales was proportionally less than the rate of total revenue growth for the same year, primarily as a result of a growth in sales of higher margin products, a slight improvement in productivity and a slight decrease in raw materials cost, which, taken together, more than offset an increase in distribution costs due to increased sales into Russia, which involve the transportation of products over long distances to Russian customers and the incurrence of significant import tariffs, and higher indirect production costs due to one-off spare parts write-down in the amount of 1.5 million following a change in accounting policy.
Selling and marketing expenses
Our selling and marketing expenses increased by 4.3% from 33.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 34.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in the level of internal sales and marketing resources dedicated to supporting our Russian expansion.
