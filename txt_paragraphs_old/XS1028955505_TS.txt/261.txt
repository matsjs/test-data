EU Emissions Trading Scheme ("EU ETS")
We manage emissions allowances at the Paroc Group level. We received an allocation of free emissions allowances in Phase II, many of which we reserved for future use. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we were required to use a portion of our reserved emissions allowances as our actual emissions exceeded our allocation of free emissions allowances for 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we have 430,387 emissions allowances held in reserve. In addition, "Carbon Leakage" status is granted by the European Commission (after agreement by Member States and the European Parliament) to (usually energy-intensive) industries that are deemed to face competition from non-EU countries with less stringent greenhouse gas emissions restrictions. We received ``Carbon Leakage" status for 2013-2014 and all Paroc production facilities subject to the EU ETS are therefore allocated free emissions allowances corresponding to our sector-specific ``benchmark value". We currently hope to receive this status again for 2015-2019; the mineral wool sector has again been specified as a sector deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage in the draft European Commission decision published on May 5, 2014 regarding the 2015-2019 carbon leakage list, although there is no guarantee that the sector will be included in the list ultimately adopted by the European Commission following scrutiny by the EU Climate Change Committee, the European Parliament and the Council. Even assuming that Carbon Leakage status is maintained throughout Phase III, we estimate that we will have an average annual shortfall of approximately 29% in emissions allowances across the whole Paroc Group throughout Phase III. This shortfall will be greater if Carbon Leakage status is not maintained after 2014. In addition, new production capacity may not be eligible for Carbon Leakage status, unless the operations meet the required criteria for new entrants. Our intention is to use the free emissions allowances that we had purchased and reserved in Phase II to spread the cost of purchasing the necessary additional emissions allowances over a longer period of time. Nonetheless, we expect the future cost of purchasing necessary additional emissions allowances to be material, although we do not have an estimate at this time given that the emissions allowance market is an open market with fluctuating prices. See ``Risk Factors--Risk Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Regulations regarding carbon dioxide emissions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
