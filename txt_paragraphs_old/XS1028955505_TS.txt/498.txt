consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those discussed below or that a court will not agree with any such positions. This summary assumes that investors purchase either series of Notes at their ``issue price" (the first price at which a substantial amount of such series of Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering and that they hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors, and does not address U.S. federal non-income, state, local, foreign or other tax laws. This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal tax purposes, insurance companies, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that use or are required to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for securities, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging, integrated, constructive sale, or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. individual expatriates or entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar). Additionally, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on certain ``net investment income'' pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
As used herein, the term ``U.S. Holder'' means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective purchasers that are partnerships should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.
THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF OWNING THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.
Additional Payments
In certain circumstances (see ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e N o te s -- O p tio n a l R e d e m p t i o n " ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e N o te s -- C h a n g e o f C o n tr o l" and ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e N o te s -- --W ith h o ld in g T a x e s ") we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on a series of Notes.
Because of the possibility of such payments, subject to certain exceptions, a series of Notes may be treated as ``contingent payment debt instruments,'' in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although the issue is not free from doubt, the Issuer intends to take the position that the possibility of such additional amounts being paid on a series of Notes is remote or incidental under applicable Treasury regulations. Therefore, the Issuer does not intend to treat the potential payment of additional interest or the potential payment of a premium pursuant to the optional redemption or change of control provisions as part of the yield to maturity of a series of Notes and does not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments.
