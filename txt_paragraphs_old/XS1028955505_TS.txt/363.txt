Prior to 40 days after the Issue Date, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book- Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer'' within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under "Transfer Restrictions" and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of 100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ``Transfer Restrictions."
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.
