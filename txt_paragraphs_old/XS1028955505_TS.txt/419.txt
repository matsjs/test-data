The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.
Amendments and Waivers
Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or modification;
(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;
(3) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any Note;
(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under ``--Optional Redemption";
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;
