Liquidity describes our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business operations, including our working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings under our Existing Senior Facility.

Cash flow from operating activities
Our net cash from operating activities increased by 36.3% from 43.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 59.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a 6.9 million decrease in working capital in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase in cash flow from operations of 4.8 million for the year (predominantly as a result of an underlying increase in EBITDA of 7.6 million for the year) and a lower net interest paid of 3.5 million, partially offset by a higher tax expense for the year in the amount of 1.0 million.
