We believe that our cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and debt service requirements as they become due. We cannot, however, assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, that our currently anticipated sales development, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available under our New Revolving Credit Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure-- We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and sustain our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control."
