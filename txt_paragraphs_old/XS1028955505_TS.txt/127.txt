future pari passu debt and non-super senior hedging, if any, together holding more than 50% in aggregate principal value of the senior secured liabilities and (provided the aggregate amount of such debt is above a specified de minimis level) the pari passu liabilities then outstanding, and certain hedging liabilities permitted to be secured on a non-super senior basis pari passu with the Notes (the "Majority Senior Secured Creditors''). The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth that both the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall be entitled to provide written enforcement instructions (the "Initial Enforcement Notice") to the Security Agent (which the Security Agent shall forward to each other creditor representative which did not deliver such notice). The Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, subject to the following: (1) if (a) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not, within three months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, either (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent thereof in writing) or (ii) appointed a Financial Advisor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to assist them in making such a determination, or (b) the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined under ``--Permitted Payments'' in "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement'' below) has not occurred within six months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred; (2) if an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a debtor under the Intercreditor Agreement, then the Security Agent will, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors elect to provide enforcement instructions, act in accordance with such instructions until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred; (3) if (a) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent thereof in writing) or appointed a Financial Advisor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to assist them in making such a determination and (b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors (i) determine in good faith (and notify the other creditor representatives and the Security Agent) that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realisation proceeds of any enforcement and (ii) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles (see "--Security Enforcement Principles'' in "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" below) before the Security Agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, then the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.
In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer or, if applicable, the shares of any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes, the Note Guarantees (together with claims under the Notes) and the liens over any other assets securing the Notes and the Note Guarantee may be released. See "Description of other indebtedness--IntercreditorAgreement" and "Description of the Notes--Security--Release of Liens."
Other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against us or our subsidiaries during the consultation period, we or one or more of our subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be

impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness which may be secured by security interests in the Collateral, the holders of the Notes may not comprise the requisite majority of the senior secured creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent. See `Description o f Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement.''
It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.
The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of pari passu security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the firstpriority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among other things, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
The security interests granted to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party, including that of competent regulatory authorities (including competition regulators) or courts, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.
Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and any other jurisdictions in which Collateral may be located may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.
