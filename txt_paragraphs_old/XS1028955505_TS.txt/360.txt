In addition, as described below under ``--Certain Covenants--Additional Guarantees" and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain other Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture may also be required to enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the SecurityAgent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the SecurityAgent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law," "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult or provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law" and "Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations."
A portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, non-Guarantors would have had no third-party Indebtedness outstanding. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See ``--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness. "
Note Guarantees Release
The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:
· a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of the sale or other disposition;
· the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;
· legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in "--Defeasance" and "--Satisfaction and Discharge";
