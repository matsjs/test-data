(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Similar Business;
(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, p r o v id e d that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated, (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date,
p r o v id e d , h o w e v e r, if the assets disposed of constitute Collateral or constitute all or substantially all of the assets of a Restricted Subsidiary whose Capital Stock has been pledged as Collateral, the Issuer shall pledge or shall cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to pledge any acquired Capital Stock or assets referred to in this covenant in favor of the Notes on a first-priority basis.
The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes ``Excess Proceeds." Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.
On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 15.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (``A s s e t D is p o s itio n O ffer3'') to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a p r o rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.
The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the ``A s s e t D is p o s itio n O ffe r P e r io d "'). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the `Asset Disposition Purchase Date''), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the ``Asset Disposition Offer Amount'') or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.
