If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee's and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture governing the Notes, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.
Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ``Notice to Investors
Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the Issuer's Paying Agent in Ireland so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on Global Exchange Market of that exchange and the rules and regulations of such exchange so require.
To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof.
The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.
Redemption of Global Notes
In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or their respective nominees, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The aggregate price payable to the holders of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note, or any portion thereof. The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of 100,000 may be redeemed in part.
