Grow our market share in other focus markets with existing proven products
In our TI division, our strategy is to strengthen our market positioning and grow market share in certain core end-markets, by leveraging our state-of-the-art technical insulation manufacturing capability at our Trzemeszno facility. This growth is expected to be led by our HVAC offering, and strengthening our dealer network will be highly important to achieving these strategic objectives. Outside of Europe, where we sell

technical insulation on a project basis, we intend to take a highly selective and opportunistic approach to project sales, with a focus on larger-scale industrial projects with higher value-added products.
In our PPS division, our strategy is to emphasize our panels' design and aesthetics, and the fact that our product offering includes the materials needed to complete a panel wall structure.
Focus on the growth potential in Russia and capitalize on our in-country manufacturing presence
Our recent investment in our new Tver manufacturing facility in Russia, which began meaningful commercial production in January 2014, has provided us with an in-country manufacturing presence and will enable us to serve the growing Russian market. Although we had previously sold our products in Russia through sales offices, developing an in-country manufacturing presence has reduced the transportation costs required to serve the market and has allowed us to avoid the significant tariffs on our imported products, which had previously limited the profitability of our Russian sales. We intend to use the quality of our product offering and our brand strength to modestly grow market share.
We anticipate that demand in the Russian market will support our new Tver manufacturing facility operating at high capacity utilization from the second year of its operation. Although no decision has yet been made, detailed plans are being considered for the addition of a second production line in Tver for the manufacture of base stone wool, as well as the addition of new machinery that would provide us with off line TI production capacity, which would double base production capacity in Russia and allow us to take advantage of growing Russian demand for technical insulation solutions.
