On February 27, 2014, the Commission Regulation No 176/2014 amending Regulation No 1031/2010 entered into force. The new regulation altered the previously determined volumes of emissions allowances to be auctioned in 2013-20. In accordance with the new regulation, the Commission is postponing the auctioning of 900 million emissions allowances from 2014 to 2016 until 2019-2020 to allow the demand to pick up ("Back-loading"). The Back-loading does not affect the overall volume of emissions allowances to be auctioned in the third trading period--it only affects the distribution of auction volumes over the period. In accordance with the new regulation, allowances are reduced by 400 million in 2014, 300 million in 2015 and 200 million in 2016. Emissions allowances to be auctioned are correspondingly increased by 300 million in 2019 and 600 million in 2020.
Energy efficiency regulations
The EU has also adopted directives regulating the energy efficiency of buildings, for example, the EU Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and the EU Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings. The Energy Efficiency Directive (the ``EED") targets a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020. The EED entered into force in December 2012, and obliges Member States to set national energy efficiency targets and report any progress achieved towards these targets to the European Commission by April 30 of each year. Alternatively, under the EED Member States may opt to take other policy measures to achieve energy savings among final customers, provided that the amount of such savings is equivalent to the amount of new energy savings required by the energy efficiency obligation scheme option. New energy efficient goals for 2030, which are likely to be in excess of the present 20% reduction target, are also currently under review by the European Commission. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (the ``EPBD") instructs Member States to set minimum standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings, which must be quantifiable and subject to a specified calculation methodology which takes into account multiple factors that influence energy use (e.g., thermal characteristics of the building, heating installation and hot water supply). However the EPBD does not specify what the specific performance standards should be. Detailed performance requirements are set at a national level, within the confines of
151
certain EU guidelines, such as the requirement that all new buildings must be "near zero energy buildings'' by 2020.
The Finnish Land Use and Building Act (the "LBA", 132/1999) implements the requirements set out in the latter Directive by providing that new buildings must fulfill the minimum energy efficiency requirements set out in the Finnish Building Regulations adopted by the Ministry of the Environment. Accordingly, construction developers must choose their construction materials with energy efficiency in mind. The same applies to repair constructions. The new energy efficiency regulation might have a favorable effect on the demand for our heat-insulating products.
Sweden
In Sweden, we are primarily subject to the provisions in the Swedish Environmental Code (Sw. miljöbalken 1998:808) and related ordinances and regulations, for example, the Environmental Proceedings Ordinance (Sw. Miljöprövningsförördningen 2013:251). See "--Finland'' above for information on European-wide regulations. The Swedish Environmental Code includes provisions regarding matters such as environmental permits, environmental liability and handling of chemicals and waste.
