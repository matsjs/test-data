Marketing
The routes to market for our TI products vary depending on the end market and geography. Most products are sold through contractors and distributors, with OEM and some marine products sold directly to customers. Our TI division marketing effort is led by dedicated sales personnel for all of its major markets. The sales team is split into three sales areas who each establish and maintain customer relationships with dealers, distributors, contractors and OEM customers. We continue to expand our portfolio of approved HVAC specifications and focus on strengthening customer relationships through being engrained within the process of customer product development.
