The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, to exclude Holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or the payment of the consideration therefor, would require the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (x) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
Maintenance of Listing
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange for so long as the Notes are outstanding; p r o v id e d that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on another "recognised stock exchange" as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.
Further Assurances
The Issuer will, and will procure that each of its Subsidiaries will, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require (1) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents; and (2) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets. The Issuer will, and will procure that each of its Subsidiaries will, execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.
