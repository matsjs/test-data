Our significant leverage could continue for the foreseeable future and the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our business and the holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:
 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;
 increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in economic conditions generally;
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged or have greater financial resources;
 exposing us to increases in interest rates with respect to our floating rate debt instruments, such as the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes; and
 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including those with respect to the Notes.
Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.
Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in thefuture which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes.
