Our business is organized in four divisions:
· Technical Insulation ("TI"). Our Technical Insulation division produces high-quality stone wool products used in specialized industrial and technical applications. Because the TI division's products are tailored for specific customer applications, including meeting regulatory requirements, the TI division has its own manufacturing capacity. It uses stone wool from the Base Production division to produce more customized TI products through its own production lines and specialized machinery. There are 18 TI production lines at four plants. Products in the TI division are primarily used to provide insulation from heat, fire, condensation and sound, and are supplied to four key end-markets: heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HV4C"), process industries, marine and offshore and original equipment manufacturers (``OEM"). The TI division also sells specialized acoustics and roofing products to the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Technical Insulation division generated sales of 150.9 million (with external sales of 133.5 million, or 30.8% of our total sales).
· Panel System ("PPS"). Our Panel System division manufactures sandwich facade panels--lightweight steel-faced panels with an insulating core of stone wool. The main application of these panels are in the industrial and commercial construction of warehouses, municipal buildings and offices. The PPS division buys its stone wool from the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Panel System division generated sales of 56.2 million (with external sales of 56.2 million, or 13.0% of our total sales).
· Base Production ("Base"). Our Base Production division is responsible for producing all of the stone wool for our BI, TI and PPS divisions, developing proprietary production technology and managing capacity utilization across the Paroc Group. As of March 31, 2014, we operated eight production plants in five different countries with 13 Base production lines producing stone wool. Production sites are managed as a network, with production costs allocated to the most cost-efficient plant, taking into account distribution costs. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Base division generated sales of 207.8 million (including internal sales of 207.3 million and external sales of 0.5 million). All of our internal sales are at a fixed cost agreed at the beginning of each year.

History
Our business has its origin in 1937, when a local manufacturer began manufacturing stone wool in Sweden. Stone wool manufacturing began in Finland in 1952, the same year Partek, a Finnish industrial conglomerate, first commenced insulation production. We were formed under Partek and in 1982, Paroc's name and trademark were registered for the first time and our Finnish and Swedish operations begin to operate under one group. In 1999, Paroc was carved out from Partek after a 60% interest in Paroc was acquired by Industri Kapital and the company name changed to "Paroc." In 2003, Paroc was acquired by Banc of America Capital Partners Europe and Accent Equity and, in 2006, Paroc was acquired by Arcapita Bank B.S.C. In 2009, after a restructuring of our debt facilities, a lender consortium took control of Paroc, with management taking an ownership stake in the Group. See ``Principal Shareholders
