The following table sets forth, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period end Bloomberg Composite Rate (New York) expressed as U.S. dollars per 1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a ``best market'' calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and other financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. We make no representation that the euro or U.S. dollar amounts referred to in this offering memorandum have been, could have been or could, in the future, be converted into U.S. dollars or euro, as the case may be, at any particular rate, if at all.
The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last business day of each month during the relevant year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on each business day for the relevant month, or shorter period, as the case may be.
The Bloomberg Composite Rate of the euro on May 8, 2014 was $1.38 per 1.00.
