We monitor working capital on a monthly basis and continually seek to optimize working capital. For example, as a result of the implementation of a project to decrease accounts receivable, we achieved a reduction in the number of debtor days (defined as the product of (x) average accounts receivable for the financial year divided by total net sales for the financial year multiplied by (y) 365 days) from 44 debtor days in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 41 debtor days in the year ended December 31, 2013. Furthermore, in 2013 we introduced an initiative designed to improve accounts payable turnover. As part of the initiative, payment terms with our smaller suppliers were renegotiated and any contracts having payment terms of less than 30 days are no longer accepted without the approval of senior management. As a result of this initiative, we achieved an increase in the number of creditor days (defined as the product of (x) average accounts payable for the financial year divided by total cost of goods sold for the financial year multiplied by (y) 365 days) from 43 creditor days in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 50 creditor days in the year ended December 31, 2013.

Working capital decreased by 6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, driven primarily by (i) a decrease in trade and other receivables in the amount of 4.7 million, relating in part to a decline in trade receivables owing partially to a lower sales revenue in last two months of the year as compared to the corresponding months of the previous year and partially to the country mix (whereby Russian sales grew at a rate that was generally higher than the Group's average growth rate and on substantially shorter average payment terms), as well as a decline in certain other receivables (mainly in connection with the return of a security deposit in relation to currency hedge arrangements entered into in connection with our Russian expansion), partially offset through adverse foreign exchange effects, (ii) an increase in inventories in the amount of 2.3 million, relating primarily to the build-up of inventories of raw materials at our new manufacturing facility in Tver in connection with the commencement of its manufacturing operations and to a lesser extent an adverse foreign exchange effect, (iii) an increase in trade and other payables in the amount of 3.9 million, relating primarily to the implementation of a more stringent Group supplier payment policy (demanding at least 30 days payment terms for smaller suppliers), as well as a run rate effect of the improved vendor invoices circulation, materially offset through a decline in the accrued expenses and VAT payables, but supported through a favourable foreign exchange effect, and (iv) an
