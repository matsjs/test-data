The proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on hand, will be applied to (i) redeem in full the Existing Senior Notes, (ii) make certain payments to holders of the Existing Junior Notes and (iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering. Our Existing Senior Facility, which we expect will remain undrawn as of the Issue Date, will be canceled in connection with the Offering.
In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into our 60 million New Revolving Credit Facility on or before the Issue Date. We do not expect any amounts to be drawn under our New Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date, provided that the amounts available for drawing thereunder will be reduced as of the Issue Date by the applicable euro equivalent amount of our SEK 35 million Pensions L/C, which is being rolled into our New Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Contractual Obligations--Pension obligations."
Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are lenders under the Existing Senior Facility or holders of the Existing Senior Notes (or both) and will be repaid with the proceeds of the Offering. See ``Plan of Distribution."
