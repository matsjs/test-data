Selling and marketing expenses
Research and development expenses
Our research and development expenses increased by 15.9% from 6.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of the one-time impairment write-down of certain technology development costs in April 2012, combined with a slight reduction in the level of spending with respect to R&D activities during the year which partially offset a depreciation charge in the year.
Administrative expenses
Our administrative expenses increased by 20.2% from 20.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 25.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of costs incurred in connection with the restructuring of our finance, accounting and controlling functions, an impairment write-down in respect of certain Russian real property assets and certain other increased administrative expenses (including, among other things, with respect to recruitment in connection with our Russian expansion and the transfer of our corporate headquarters to new premises in Helsinki).

Other operating income Our other operating income increased by 87.6% from 0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of income generated from the sale of shares held in a company outside the Group.
Other operating expenses Our other operating expenses decreased by 27.4% from 6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a decline in certain unusual expense items as compared to the prior year (specifically, with respect to one-time costs related to our Russian expansion and redundancy costs for the year), partially offset by a higher cost of bad debt allowances for certain customers in Finland and Norway.
Dividend received, interest income and other financial income Our dividend received, interest income and other financial income increased by 27.1% from 7.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 8.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates impacting the revaluation of internal loans and the market value of foreign exchange derivatives.
