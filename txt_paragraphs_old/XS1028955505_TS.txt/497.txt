Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to the holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder is not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and provided that such a holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are effectively connected.
Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes, except for certain payments of interest (and other returns on Notes) to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes (see 'H o ld e r s re sid e n t in S w e d e n " below).
Holders resident in Sweden
Generally, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, all capital income (e.g., income that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on Notes) will be taxable. Specific tax consequences, however, may be applicable to certain categories of corporations, e.g., life insurance companies. Further, specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder of Notes realizes a capital loss on the Notes and to any currency exchange gains or losses.
If amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in Sweden, including a Swedish branch, to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld by the legal entity on such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes should normally also be withheld on other returns on Notes (but not capital gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to above.
