In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.
Definitive Registered Notes
Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes only in the following circumstances:
(1) if either Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;
(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default which results in action by the Trustee pursuant to the enforcement provisions under the Indenture.
Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book- Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), its current procedure is to request that Definitive Registered Notes be issued to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request.
In any such events described in clause (1) or (2), the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and certain certification requirements and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). The Definitive Registered Notes will bear a restrictive legend with respect to certain transfer restrictions, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or by applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed, provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of 100,000 or in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
