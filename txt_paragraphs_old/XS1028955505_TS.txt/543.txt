 that were rendered under observance of due process of law;
 the recognition of which would not manifestly contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sweden,
ought to be examined by the appropriate Swedish district court following which such court may hand down a new judgment, based on the foreign judgment, without retrial on the merits of the dispute although the court will be free to do so at its discretion. The exact scope of this principle has yet to be determined.
Poland
We have been advised by our Polish counsel that enforcement of judgments of foreign courts is subject to the 1988 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, the Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, and other relevant treaties or conventions, including relevant bilateral treaties and the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure.
There is no treaty between the United States and Poland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, to judgments of U.S. courts, the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure shall apply. Those rules provide for enforcement of foreign judgments concerning matters which may be settled by Polish civil courts if the judgment is enforceable in the country where it has been rendered. In addition, the following requirements must be satisfied:
 the judgment is final in the jurisdiction in which it was issued;
 the case does not belong to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Polish courts;
 no summons has been served on the defendant, who was not engaged in the dispute on the matter, in due time for his defense;
