The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under "--Release of Liens"
Enforcement of Security Interest
The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedge counterparties. These limitations are described under "Description of Other Indebtedneess--Intercreditor Agreement" and "Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests." The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound
The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled ``Description of Other Indebtedneess--Intercreditor Agreement."
The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:
1. appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;
2. agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and
3. irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents.
