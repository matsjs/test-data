Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests
Global Clearance, Settlement and Trading under the Book-Entry System
Application will be made to list the Notes represented by the Global Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with the respective rules and operating procedures.
The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the relevant settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of us, the Trustee, or the paying agents takes any responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.
Initial Settlement
Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.
Secondary Market Trading
The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and seller's accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.
