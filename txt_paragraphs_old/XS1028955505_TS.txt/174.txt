Revenue
Our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 remained generally flat at 433.1 million, compared to 430.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Insulation
Total revenue for our Insulation reporting segment in the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 1.5% from 385.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 390.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013.
Building Insulation revenue remained generally flat in the year ended December 31, 2013 at 256.7 million, compared to 257.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, with volumes generally flat, primarily as a result of a decline in the level of residential construction activity and a continuation of challenging market and economic conditions in several key markets, particularly in Finland and Sweden (where we faced strong competition, principally with respect to roofing products, as a result of aggressive pricing by a new market entrant seeking to gain market share).
Technical Insulation revenue increased by 4.6% from 144.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 150.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, despite volumes remaining generally flat, primarily as a result of our continued focus on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products resulting in an improved product mix variance, combined with an increase in prices for our TI products generally and the implementation of regulatory changes in Finland and Sweden requiring new buildings to have thicker, better quality technical insulation.
