Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior basis by Paroc Sverige AB, Paroc Oy Ab, Paroc AB, UAB Paroc, Paroc Panel System Oy Ab, Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o. and ZAO Paroc (together, the "Guarantors").
The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See `Description of Other Indebtedness--IntercreditorAgreement" for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
This ``Description of the Notes' is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request.
The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Generally, only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.
