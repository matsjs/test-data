Gift and inheritance tax
Unless an applicable international tax treaty states otherwise, gift or inheritance taxes will arise in Finland with respect to a transfer of the Notes by way of gift by, or on the death of, a holder of such Notes, in case the donor/deceased person or the donee/beneficiary was a resident of Finland at the time of the gift/death. Subject to certain restrictions, the Finnish inheritance and gift tax act allows crediting the gift or inheritance tax, paid for the same property in some other country in case the donee/beneficiary is a resident in Finland. For the purposes of Finnish gift and inheritance taxes, a person who has his/her permanent home and dwelling in Finland, is deemed resident in Finland.
