As we manufacture building materials the regulation on construction products is relevant to our activities. In Lithuania, the manufacture and sale of construction materials is subject to technical regulations and approval requirements.
On July 1, 2013 the European Construction Products Regulation (No 305/2011) (the ``EU Construction Regulation") entered in the force in the whole EU. EU Construction Regulation provides the EU-level framework for the approvals and unified criteria for construction products. The fact that a product fulfills these criteria is shown through the ``CE'' marking. All products that belong under a harmonized product standard ("hEN") adopted by the European Committee for Standardization must be CE marked for commercialization.
Public Institution Enterprise Lithuania (Versli Lietuva) branch Business Gateway (Verslo vartai) is a responsible institution for the communication of implementing EU Construction Regulation. As this function is quite new for this institution, all practical issues are solved through the Construction Production Certification Center (Statybos produkcijos sertifikavimo centras, "SPSC").
The EU Construction Regulation also contains provisions on the granting of European technical assessments (``ETAs") for construction materials that are not under a harmonized product standard, in order to allow them to be distributed within the EU with the CE marking. Acquiring an ETA for a product is voluntary. The basic requirements of construction products listed in the EU Construction Regulation form a basis for the drafting of both harmonized product standards and ETAs.
The traditional technical assessment body granting ETAs in Lithuania is SPSC. The list of competent companies who are permitted to perform the technical assessment are enumerated in orders of the Minister of Environment.
There are three main orders of the minister of Environment, related to construction product certification:
· Order No. D1-656 on Regulated construction products list (Reglamentuojamu statybos produktu syrasas), dated 5/9/22013;
· Order No. D1-612 on Construction products, which do not have harmonized technical specifications, exploiting characteristics evaluation, verification and declaration. Tests laboratories and certification companies assignment (Statybos produktu, neturinciu darniuju techniniu specifikaciju, eksploataciniu savybiu pastovumo vertinimas, tikrinimas ir deklaravimas. Bandymu laboratoriju ir sertifikavimo istaigu paskyrimas), dated 26/09/2013;
· Order No. D1-871 on Appointment of bodies carrying out third party tasks in the assessment and verification of performance of construction products (Del istaigu, atliekanciu treciuju saliu uzduotis vertinant ir tikrinant statybos produktu eksploataciniu savybiu pastovumq, paskyrimo), dated 27/11/2013.
