In the event of a liquidation, insolvency, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, the value of the Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among other things, the condition of the Collateral and our industry, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, market and economic conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern, the availability of buyers and other factors. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Collateral if they deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. As a result, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. We cannot assure you of the value of the Collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding would be sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes.
We cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes and the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to cover the amount of debt secured by such Collateral. There is no requirement under the Indenture to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient, though applicable law may provide otherwise. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding-up or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity's shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time.
The Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the Security Agent on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to our or the Guarantors' shares that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if additional Notes are issued under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same Collateral as the holders of the relevant Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the Collateral for such Notes.
The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent has been appointed to act as a common security agent for the secured parties under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and certain hedging arrangements with regard to the Collateral (as applicable). The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the direction of the ``instructing group.''
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent shall act upon the instructions of the ``Senior Secured Instructing Group'', which is comprised of (a) the holders of more than 662/3% of the aggregate of all outstanding liabilities under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the super senior hedging liabilities (the ``Majority Super Senior Creditors'') and (b) the holders of Notes and holders of
65
future pari passu debt and non-super senior hedging, if any, together holding more than 50% in aggregate principal value of the senior secured liabilities and (provided the aggregate amount of such debt is above a specified de minimis level) the pari passu liabilities then outstanding, and certain hedging liabilities permitted to be secured on a non-super senior basis pari passu with the Notes (the "Majority Senior Secured Creditors''). The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth that both the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall be entitled to provide written enforcement instructions (the "Initial Enforcement Notice") to the Security Agent (which the Security Agent shall forward to each other creditor representative which did not deliver such notice). The Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, subject to the following: (1) if (a) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not, within three months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, either (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent thereof in writing) or (ii) appointed a Financial Advisor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to assist them in making such a determination, or (b) the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined under ``--Permitted Payments'' in "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement'' below) has not occurred within six months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred; (2) if an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a debtor under the Intercreditor Agreement, then the Security Agent will, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors elect to provide enforcement instructions, act in accordance with such instructions until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred; (3) if (a) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent thereof in writing) or appointed a Financial Advisor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to assist them in making such a determination and (b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors (i) determine in good faith (and notify the other creditor representatives and the Security Agent) that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realisation proceeds of any enforcement and (ii) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles (see "--Security Enforcement Principles'' in "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" below) before the Security Agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, then the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.
These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of Notes in a number of respects and may permit the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility to control enforcement in circumstances in which their interests are different from those of the holders of Notes. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the relevant hedging arrangements or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such noteholders. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the recovery from an enforcement sale. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain hedging arrangements or the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
