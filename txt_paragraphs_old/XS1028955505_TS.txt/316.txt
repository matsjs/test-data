CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In the course of our ordinary business activities, we regularly enter into agreements with or render services to related parties. In turn, such related parties may render services or deliver goods to us as part of their business. Purchase and supply agreements between subsidiaries and affiliated companies and with associated companies or shareholders of such associated companies, including non-controlling interests, that are not part of our Group are entered into on a regular basis within the ordinary course of business. Such transactions include, but are not limited to, the supply of raw materials for the production of our products and the sale of our products and the products manufactured by any entity described above. Furthermore, financing agreements and cash pooling agreements with and among subsidiaries and affiliated companies are entered into during the ordinary course of business.
We believe that all transactions with affiliated companies and persons with which members of our board of directors are affiliated are negotiated and conducted on a basis equivalent to those that would have been achievable on an arm's-length basis, and that the terms of these transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers.
We have the following balances with related parties:
