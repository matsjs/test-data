We include certain financial measures in this offering memorandum, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as defined by us, which are supplemental measures of our performance and our ability to service our indebtedness that are not required by, recognized or presented in accordance with IFRS or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 EBITDA: We define EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations before income tax expense, finance income and costs, depreciation and amortization and impairments;
 EBITDA margin: We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA for the applicable period divided by revenue for the same period;
 Adjusted EBITDA: We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding items of a non-recurring or unusual nature, including in respect of our Russian expansion (including both our construction phase and our pre-commercial production phase), redundancies and restructuring, our transfer pricing case and the closure of our Lappeenranta site. See "Summary-- Summary Financial and Operating Information-- Summary Other Financial Information" for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA; and
 Adjusted EBITDA margin: We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable period divided by revenue for the same period.
We present the non-IFRS measures described above in order to enhance the understanding of our financial performance and our ability to service our indebtedness, including the Notes. Although the non-IFRS measures described above are not necessarily measures of our ability to fund our cash needs, we understand that such non-IFRS measures are used by certain investors as measures of financial performance and to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that also report such non-IFRS measures. EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements determined in accordance with IFRS, are unaudited and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, (i) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (iii) any other measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS.
EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:
 they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
 they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
