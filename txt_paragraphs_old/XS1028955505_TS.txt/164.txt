Revenue
Revenue primarily consists of income generated from the sale of building materials, including building insulation, technical insulation, marine insulation, panels and acoustic products, as well as the sale of services to third parties. Revenue from the sale of building materials is recognized when all the following criteria have been satisfied: (1) the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; (2) the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; (3) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (4) it is probable the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and (5) the costs incurred or to be incurred with respect to the transaction can be measured reliably. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized once the service has been rendered. Revenues recognized based on sales contract prices are deducted by estimated discounts at the time of sale.
