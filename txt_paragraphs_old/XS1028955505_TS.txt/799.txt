Tax dispute related to transfer pricing
The Finnish tax authorities have made a tax reassessment concerning years 2006-2008 in Paroc Oy Ab. Based on tax decisions that came in 2012 and 2013 the company should pay in total 22.3 million in taxes, penalties and interest. The amount includes 14.1 million taxes, 2.3 million surtax and 5.9 million accrued corporate interests and penalty interests. Surtax and interests have been calculated until December 31, 2013. The company has a different interpretation related to the transfer pricing of the Group's intra-group pricing of supplies of raw materials, license fees and distribution services than the tax authorities and the Company has made an appeal against the tax assessment with the Board of Appeals. The Company has been granted stay of execution related to the reassessed tax payments. The said stay of execution is in force until such time when the Board of Appeals gives its decision on the matter or latest until January 31, 2015. The obligation to pay the tax realizes in case the appeal process is lost. The Group has not made any provisions in the 2013 financial statements since the management strongly believes that all transfer pricing guidelines have been followed and the same method has been followed consistently from 2009 to 2013. The Company has obtained a third party opinion from legal expert on the matter, which supports the management's view.
