Financial covenant
We currently believe that, due to the level of headroom contained in the financial covenant, the financial covenant ratio contained in the New Revolving Credit Facility will be less onerous than the financial covenants in the Existing Senior Facility.
Undertakings
In addition to the financial covenant, the New Revolving Credit Facility will include the following affirmative covenants: mandatory periodic reporting of financial and other information, compliance certificate for financial covenant and guarantor coverage, annual budget within 45 days of year-end, annual presentation, notice upon the occurrence of events of default and certain other events.
176
Events of default
The New Revolving Credit Facility will include certain events of default, such as failure to make payment of amounts due, defaults under other agreements evidencing indebtedness, failure to comply with the financial covenant or other obligations, certain bankruptcy events and unlawfulness or repudiation/ rescission of certain agreements. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of payment obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility.
Intercreditor Agreement
In connection with the entry into the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture, the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of the Issuer will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility (the "RCFLenders"); (ii) any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to certain hedging agreements (collectively, the "Hedging Agreements", the liabilities under such Hedging Agreements, the `Hedging Liabilities" and any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to such Hedging Agreements being referred to in such capacity as the `Hedge Counterparties"); (iii) the Trustee, on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Notes (the "Noteholders"); (iv) intragroup creditors and debtors; and (vi) any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as direct or indirect shareholders of the Issuer in respect of certain structural debt that the Issuer or another member of the Group has incurred or may incur in the future (including any subordinated shareholder loans).
