The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer's website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the Trustee will also be made available at the specified office of the listing agent in Dublin, Ireland.
