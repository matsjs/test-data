For Insulation Finland an increase in discount rate of 0.5 percentage points or any other reduction in gross margin of 1.2 percentage points, of the estimated gross margins would cause the CGU's recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying amount. According to the management's assumption, in other cash generating units, any reasonably possible change in a key variable would not create a situation in which the unit's carrying value would exceed its value in use.
Emission allowances
The European Emission Trading Scheme started on January 1, 2005. In the beginning of 2008 emission rights were extended to cover the manufacturing of mineral wool. Paroc's sites included in the European Emission Trading Scheme are the plants in Finland, Sweden, Poland and Lithuania.
