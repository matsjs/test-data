Intangible assets are recognized at the original acquisition cost. Intangible rights including quarry rights acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Those intangible assets with definite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization periods are based on the estimated useful lives as follows:
0 - 5 years up to 20 years 0 - 5 years 20 years 17 - 82 years 15 years
Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives, like the brand Paroc, are not amortized but tested for impairment annually.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from an acquisition represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities recognized. Goodwill is recognized at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a cash generating unit may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, measured as value in use. The impairment loss is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit, and then to the other assets of the unit on pro rata basis. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in any circumstances.
Research and development costs
All research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are also expensed as incurred unless all of the following six criteria are met:1
(1) there is technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale
