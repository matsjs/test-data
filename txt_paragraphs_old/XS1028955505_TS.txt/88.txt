· varying degrees of concentration among suppliers and customers;
· foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds; and
· difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees (including restrictions on employing foreign workers), or further rationalizing our work force.
Our expansion into markets outside of our core markets in Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global

business depends to a considerable extent on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions and unforeseeable developments. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies which will be effective in each location where we do business and obtain raw materials from or may do so in the future.
We may not be able to successfully managefuture growth, including by way of organic growth to new regions and potential acquisitions which may expose us to additional risks.
Over the past decade, we have expanded our business primarily through organic growth, in particular in western, central and eastern Europe, the Baltic States and Russia, and we intend to continue our international expansion in all our divisions. In implementing this strategy, we are pursuing both organic growth and evaluating the market for potential acquisitions of insulation production facilities and other companies. Our growth has placed and will continue to place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources. Our ability to manage this planned growth and integrate operations, technologies, products and personnel depends on our administrative, financial and operational controls, our ability to create the infrastructure necessary to exploit market opportunities for our products and our financial capabilities. We may also reach limits under applicable antitrust merger control laws if we attempt to further grow through acquisitions in certain markets. In order to compete effectively and to grow our business profitably, we will need to maintain our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, implement new systems as necessary, attract and retain adequate management personnel, and hire a qualified workforce that we can train and manage.
Our operations and expansion into Russia pose significant challenges as we attempt to successfully navigate operating in this new jurisdiction. We are aware of certain deficiencies related to the new Tver production facilities, as well as various regulatory, legal and other deficiencies in our operations in Russia, as described below. Although we believe that these are not unusual for a new business operating in Russia due to the regulatory structure and operational authorization process, we will need to rectify these deficiencies in order to ensure that our business operations are compliant with applicable laws. We commenced commercial operations and production at our new manufacturing facility in Tver in January 2014. As the facility is in its opening phase, with only limited operations underway, we are still in the process of obtaining certain necessary authorization documents. The process of obtaining these documents may take time, and we may not be compliant with certain regulations during this initial period. For example, upon completion of a construction project some of our Russian production facilities may be classified as "dangerous industrial facilities", which will trigger the need for us to comply with specific industrial safety regulations. To date we have taken some, but not all, of the necessary steps to comply with these industrial safety regulations, but some time may pass before we become fully compliant. Moreover, some of our operations at Tver (specifically, our industrial gas consumption facilities) may be regarded as explosive dangerous industrial facilities and, if this is the case, we will need to obtain a relevant license in order to operate gas consumption facilities. We have commenced this process, but we only expect to receive the license towards the end of 2014, and there is no guarantee that we will receive the license. Certain administrative sanctions (including the temporary restriction of operations for up to 90 days) may be imposed on our operations in Russia if we fail to promptly complete all industrial safety and license compliance procedures. We additionally have some deficiencies in our title to real estate that will need to be corrected. There are also certain deficiencies in corporate formalities, charter capital and documentation that we need to address, as they could potentially result in compulsory liquidation of ZAO Paroc, our Russian subsidiary. However, once we have shareholder approval, we intend to convert ZAO Paroc from a closed joint-stock company to a limited liability company (or "OOO") later in 2014, which should address these corporate formality deficiencies. ZAO Paroc will have to notify its creditors of this reorganization process by publication of an official reorganization notice. Creditors whose claims have arisen before such publication will have the right to take legal action to accelerate their claims or demand early termination of the relevant agreements and compensation for associated losses incurred by them, provided that ZAO Paroc, its shareholder or any other third party does not provide sufficient security in respect of ZAO Paroc's liabilities to its creditors. However, we believe that in relation to the potential creditors of ZAO Paroc this risk is rather low, as most such potential creditors are either customers with whom we have contracts generally based on payment after delivery, or service providers whose rights should not be adversely affected by the reorganization and who we would not expect to wish to terminate their agreements with us. We also have what could be significant shortcomings in our intellectual property protection in Russia. See ``--Any threat to, or impairment of, our intellectual property rights could cause us to incur costs to defend those rights." If we are unable to successfully address these issues and put in place
