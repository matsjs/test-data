Key Industry Trends
Increasing legal/regulatory push for increased energy efficiency Russia has historically been one of the most energy intensive countries in the world. This is partly due to the relatively low energy efficiency of the existing building stock, as well as climactic and intrinsic economic factors (with a significant part of its industrial sector consisting of energy-heavy industries). The U.S. Energy Information Administration ("EIA") determined in 2011 that for every USD1,000 of GDP produced, Russia consumed 1.25 tonnes coal equivalent ("tce") of primary energy, substantially above several other developed and developing economies (Finland 0.21 tce).
