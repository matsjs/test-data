Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the ``Applicable Rate"), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR plus (ii) 5.250%, as determined by the Calculation Agent. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will:
· be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, commencing on August 15, 2014;
· be payable to the holder of record of such Floating Rate Notes on the February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and
· be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.
Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes.
``Determination Date" with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.
``EURIBOR" means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the

Euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.
