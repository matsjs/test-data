In addition, the foregoing factors are often subject to varying developments in the regions and countries in which we operate. Individual regional and local competitive dynamics could in the future deteriorate and result in further significantly intensified competition in such regions or countries. For example, competitors may expand their capacities or enter or expand in markets in other regions or develop more innovative products, or other products may be preferred by consumers. The consequences of such changes or of other possible changes in the competitive environment could have material adverse effects on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. Competitors could also further improve the functionality or performance of their products and production processes leading to additional competitive pressure on prices for our products and services and potential decreases of sales volumes and market share.

Ourproducts compete with a variety ofdifferentproducts, many ofwhich we do notproduce and, as a result, we may lose market shares to such alternative products.
Our building insulation, technical insulation and sandwich panel products compete with several other types of insulation materials and facade panels that we do not produce. Other types of insulation materials (for example, glass wool, expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene and (particularly in our key Nordic BI and PPS markets) polyurethane products) and panels may be or may become more popular or may be perceived as having superior characteristics in terms of thermal insulation, load-bearing capacity, appearance, price, thickness or other respects. Given the similarities in properties, application and production, the main competitor to stone wool is glass wool, and there is a material area of overlap between mineral wool and foam insulation in external facades and roofs, as well as in sandwich panels, where mineral wool and foams are relatively more substitutable. Although both glass wool and stone wool have advantages and disadvantages, low density glass wool insulation is easier to transport than stone wool due to better compressibility and is also cheaper to use in low density insulation products than stone wool. See "Business--Competition." The degree of substitution by other types of building materials may vary by region and from time to time and may also be attributed to local building and construction traditions, preferences and regulatory requirements. Substitute products may also gain market share through more effective advertising and marketing campaigns. If the environmental, fire protection, safety, energy or other characteristics of other products improve, or if substitute products' marketing campaigns are effective, any competitive advantage our building materials products enjoy may diminish. Additionally, we compete with alternative methods to increase energy efficiency such as, among others, replacement windows or doors and more efficient heating systems. Any significant replacement of any of our specific products by other types of products which we do not produce may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to local business risks in many different countries.
Our growth strategy involves expanding outside of our core European markets, in particular into additional Central and eastern European countries, as well as Russia, and a significant portion of our current sales activities are conducted and located outside of our core markets of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States. Further, we believe that sales generated outside of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States in particular and, more generally, outside of the European Union, will increasingly account for a material portion of our total sales in the foreseeable future, which entails certain risks. These risks include, among other things:
· political instability, absence of sufficient protections for foreign investors and possible investment restrictions (including restrictions on assets belonging to certain investor groups);
· social instability, frequency of crimes and corrupt practices, and a lack of transparency on the part of governmental and political bodies;
· differing economic cycles and adverse economic conditions;
