Other operating expenses Our other operating expenses decreased by 27.4% from 6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a decline in certain unusual expense items as compared to the prior year (specifically, with respect to one-time costs related to our Russian expansion and redundancy costs for the year), partially offset by a higher cost of bad debt allowances for certain customers in Finland and Norway.
Interest expenses Our interest expenses decreased by 15.2% from 14.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 12.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a decrease in the rate of threemonth EURIBOR over the period.
Other financial expenses Our other financial expenses decreased by 29.9% from 17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates impacting the revaluation of internal loans and the market value of foreign exchange derivatives.
Income tax expense Our income tax expense changed from a tax credit of 0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to a tax expense of 7.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a substantial increase in our profit before tax from 4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 24.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, as well as the devaluation of certain deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2012 in connection with the forfeiture of certain tax losses in Paroc Oy AB during the prior year, partially offset by the write-down of certain intragroup loans being deductible from taxation and our utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses during the year in the amount of 1.3 million. In addition, the change in the Swedish tax rate from 26.3% to 22.0% contributed to a positive impact of 2.2 million in 2012.
EBITDA Our total EBITDA increased by 26.3% from 54.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 69.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a combination of the implementation of price increases in each of our BI, TI and PPS divisions, improvements being made with respect to product mix as part of our continued focus on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products, an increase in PPS volumes driven by a significant rise in the level of market activity (particularly in Sweden and Norway) and significant foreign exchange translation gains, partially offset by the incurrence of one-off costs in connection with the expansion of our Russian operations and the construction of Tver Line 1.
