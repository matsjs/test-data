(a) Each Initial Bond carries Interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from (and including) the First Issue Date up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date. Any Subsequent Bond will carry Interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from (and including) the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance (or the First Issue Date if there is no such Interest Payment Date) up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
15
(c) Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360-days basis).
(d) If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (and including) the due date up to (but excluding) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two hundred (200) basis points higher than the Interest Rate for such Interest Period. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent, the Paying Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
10. Redemption and Repurchase of the Bonds
10.1 Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds in full on the Final Maturity Date with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. If the Final Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then the redemption shall occur on the first following Business Day.
10.2 Issuer's purchase of Bonds
Each Group Company may at any time purchase Bonds, provided that any Bond purchased by a Group Company (other than the Issuer) will promptly be surrendered to the Issuer for cancellation. Bonds held by the Issuer may at the Issuer's discretion be retained, sold or cancelled.
