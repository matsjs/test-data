Acquisitions
13.15 Arm's length transactions
The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall ensure that no member of the Group shall engage in, directly or indirectly, any transaction with any party (other than between the Issuer and a Guarantor or between two or more Guarantors) (without limitation, the purchase, sale or exchange of assets or the rendering) except in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to the reasonable requirement of the Issuer's or such Group Company's business and upon fair and reasonable terms that are no less favourable to the Issuer or such Group Company, as the case may be, than those which might be obtained in arm's length transaction at that time.
13.16
Insurance
The Issuer shall, and shall ensure that all other Group Companies will, maintain insurances or captive arrangements on and in relation to its business and assets against those risks and to the extent as is usual for companies carrying on the same or substantially similar business.
13.17
Subsidiary distribution
The Issuer shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to create or permit to exist any contractual obligation (or encumbrance) restricting the right of any Subsidiary to pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders, other than permitting to subsist such contractual obligation which is not reasonably likely to prevent the Issuer from complying with its payment obligations under the Bond Terms.
