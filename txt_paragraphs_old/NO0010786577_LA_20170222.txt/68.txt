(b) The net cash proceeds from a Restricted Disposal which is permitted shall be applied:
(i) to finance (in whole or in part) the acquisition of any Replacement Assets, over which New Security shall be granted (to the extent that the original assets were covered by the Security); or
(ii) at any time following the relevant disposal, and in any event, if such proceeds are not applied as set out in paragraph (i) above within 12 months after receipt by the Issuer, to redeem Bonds of the applicable price under Clause 10.2 ( Voluntary early redemption - Call Option) at the time of redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest on redeemed Bonds); or
(iii) to redeem Bonds (plus accrued and unpaid interest on redeemed Bonds) and where repayment of the Bonds shall be carried out at the prevailing prices set out under Clause 10.2 (Voluntary early redemption - Call Option).
Notwithstanding the clauses above, if the net proceeds from a Restricted Disposal are less than EUR 2,000,000, the net proceeds may be released for general corporate purposes of the Group.
(c) The Bond Trustee shall be authorised to release existing Transaction Security of any resigning Obligor in connection with a Permitted Disposal, and (to the extent applicable) re-establish similar Transaction Security pursuant to these Bond Terms subject to such procedures and closing mechanisms as the Bond Trustee shall determine in its sole discretion.
(d) In the event that any assets over which security is granted under the Finance Documents are sold or otherwise disposed of by any Group Company to either the Issuer or any of the Issuer's wholly-owned Subsidiaries within the Group, the acquirer shall pledge such assets as security in favour of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) and any other finance parties according to the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (subject to the security principles set out therein). Any security thus granted shall be deemed to be "Transaction Security" and any documents executed in relation hereto shall be deemed as " Transaction Security Documents".
