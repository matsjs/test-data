The repayment must occur on an Interest Payment Date. The payment per Note shall be equal to the repaid amount plus (i) a premium on the repaid amount as determined pursuant to Clause 10.4.3 and (ii) accrued but unpaid Interest on the repaid amount.
The premium payable in connection with a repayment pursuant to Clauses 10.4.1 and 10.4.2 shall, for the first EUR 10,000 repaid per Note during each twelve month period until the third anniversary of the First Issue Date, be three (3) per cent. of such part of the repaid amount and otherwise be equal to the Interest Rate multiplied by the remaining part of the repaid amount.
