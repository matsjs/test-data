The Agent shall represent each of the Noteholders in accordance with the Finance Documents, including, inter alia, holding the Share Pledge and any Loan Pledge on behalf of the Noteholders and enforcing the Share Pledge and any Loan Pledge on behalf of the Noteholders. The Agent is always acting with binding effect on behalf of the Noteholders.
The Agent is entitled to engage external experts to advise the Agent when carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Agent shall act reasonably in its use of such external experts and shall, where reasonably practicable and not detrimental to the interests of the Noteholders, consult the Issuer before engaging such external experts. The Issuer shall cover the Agent's costs for (i) legal external experts and (ii) provided an Event of Default has occurred or if the purpose is to investigate if an Event of Default has occurred (or otherwise with the prior consent of the Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld)), financial external experts.
The Agent shall have no liability for damage caused by the Agent acting in accordance with instructions of the Noteholders given in accordance with Clause 14 (Noteholders' Consent), or in accordance with advice from or opinions of external experts engaged by the Agent, provided the Agent has acted with reasonable care. However, any compensation received by the Agent for damages caused by external experts of the Agent shall be distributed in accordance with Clause 13.5.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Finance Documents to the contrary, the Agent is not obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or regulation or a breach of a duty of confidentiality.
If in the Agent's reasonable opinion the cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with instructions of the Noteholders will not be covered by an expected distribution of proceeds in accordance with Clause 13.5, the Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with such instructions until it has received such indemnities (or adequate Security has been provided therefore) as it may reasonably require, save that the Agent shall always notify the Noteholders about an Event of Default in accordance with Clause 13.4.
