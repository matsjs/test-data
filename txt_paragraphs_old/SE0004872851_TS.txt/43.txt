Early repayment due to illegality
Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event
Upon a Change of Control Event occurring, each Noteholder shall have the right to request that all, or some of, its Notes be repurchased by the Issuer, at a price per Note equal to 101 per cent. of the Nominal Amount (plus accrued but unpaid Interest), during a period of twenty (20) Business Days following a notice from the Issuer of the Change of Control Event pursuant to Clause 11.1(c) (after which time period such rights lapse). If a Noteholder has so requested, the Issuer shall repurchase the relevant Notes within twenty (20) Business Days from the end of such period. The Notes repurchased by the Issuer may at the Issuer's discretion be retained, sold or cancelled by the Issuer.
Notwithstanding Clause 10.6.1, no repurchases of Notes may be made by the Issuer in accordance with Clause 10.6.1 for as long as a WCF Enforcement Event is continuing. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure by the Issuer to timely repurchase the Notes in accordance with Clause 10.6.1 shall constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Clause 13.1(a) and the unpaid amount shall carry default interest pursuant to Clause 7 (Default Interest).
Notice of repayment
Repayment in accordance with Clauses 10.3 (Voluntary total repayment) to 10.5 (Early repayment due to illegality) and Clause 10.6 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event) shall be made by giving not less than twenty (20) Business Days' notice to the Noteholders and the Agent in accordance with Clause 22 (Notices). Any such notice is irrevocable and, upon expiry of such notice period, the Issuer is bound to repay the Notes at the applicable amounts specified above in Clauses 10.3 to 10.5 and Clause 10.6.
