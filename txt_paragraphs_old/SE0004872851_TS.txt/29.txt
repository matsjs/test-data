If payment or repayment is effectuated in accordance with this Clause 6, the Issuer and the
CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay, irrespective if such payment
was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount.

DEFAULT INTEREST
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) per cent. higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue in case the failure to pay was attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which case the relevant Interest Rate shall apply instead.
