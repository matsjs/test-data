REPAYMENT AND REPURCHASE OF THE NOTES
Subject to Clause 10.1.2, the Issuer shall repay all outstanding Notes in full on the Final Maturity Date at a price per Note equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. If the Final Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then the repayment shall occur on the next Business Day.
For as long as a WCF Enforcement Event is continuing, no repayments may be made by the Issuer under Clause 10.1.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure by the Issuer to repay all outstanding Notes in full on the Final Maturity Date in accordance with Clause 10.1.1 shall constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Clause 13.1(a) and the unpaid amount shall carry default interest pursuant to Clause 7 (Default Interest).
Issuer's purchase of Notes
The Issuer, any other Group Company or an Affiliate may, subject to applicable law, at any time purchase Notes on the market or in any other way. The Notes held by the Issuer, any other Group Company or an Affiliate may at its discretion be retained, sold or, if held by the Issuer, cancelled.
