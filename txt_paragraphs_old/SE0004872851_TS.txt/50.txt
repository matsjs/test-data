Disposal of business
(a) in respect of the shares in Promyzer, to Orc; or
(b) in respect of the shares in Orc, to Promyzer,
in each case provided that any such sale or disposal shall be subject to the Share Pledge.
The Issuer shall ensure that no other Group Company shall sell or otherwise dispose of all or a substantial part of its assets or operations (including shares in other Group Companies) unless the transaction is carried out on arm's-length terms and for fair market value and:
(a) where (i) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio immediately following such disposal is below 3.0:1 calculated in accordance with Clause 12.5.3 (but excluding any business to be disposed from EBITDA) and (ii) the Interest Cover Ratio immediately following such disposal is not below 2.0:1 calculated in accordance with Clause 12.5.4, each calculated as per a testing date falling no more than one month prior to the disposal (any cash balance resulting from the disposal shall reduce the Consolidated Net Debt); or
(b) such transaction does not (calculated on a 12 month historic rolling basis) cause the net disposals (i.e. acquisitions minus disposals) to exceed assets or operations representing 10 per cent. of the total consolidated EBITDA of the Group.
Financial Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not (and shall procure that no Group Companies will) incur any new Financial Indebtedness (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the issuance of any Subsequent Notes by the Issuer) unless (i) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio tested pro forma including such incurrence is below 3.0:1, (ii) the Interest Cover Ratio is 2.0:1 or above and (iii) such new Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer (other than new Financial Indebtedness incurred as a result of the issue of Subsequent Notes) matures after the Final Maturity Date.
