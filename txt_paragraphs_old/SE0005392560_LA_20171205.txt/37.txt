(b) If a Bondholder has registered, through an Account Operator, that principal and interest shall be deposited in a certain bank account (or, in terms of the NOK Bonds, the Bondholder's account as registered with VPS), such deposits will be effected by the CSD on the relevant payment date. In other cases, payments will be transferred by the CSD to the Bondholder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. Should the CSD, due to a delay on behalf of the Issuer or some other obstacle, not be able to effect payments as aforesaid, the Issuer shall procure that such amounts are paid to the persons who are registered as Bondholders on the relevant Record Date as soon as possible after such obstacle has been removed.
(d) If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Clause 7, the Issuer and the CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay,

irrespective of whether such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms and Conditions, the NOK Bonds shall be subject to, and any payments made in relation thereto shall be made in accordance with, the rules and procedures of the VPS (which rules and procedures may differ from those of Euroclear Sweden AB).
(f) The Issuer is responsible for withholding any withholding tax imposed by applicable law on any payments to the Bondholders.
(g) If the Issuer is required by law to withhold any withholding tax from any payment under any Finance Document:
(i) the amount of the payment due from the Issuer shall be increased to such amount which is necessary to ensure that the Bondholders receive a net amount which is (after making the required withholding) equal to the payment which would have been due if no withholding had been required; and
(ii) the Issuer shall at the request of the Agent deliver to the Agent evidence that the required tax reduction or withholding has been made.
