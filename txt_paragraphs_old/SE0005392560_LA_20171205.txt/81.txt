By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf.

22.2 Duties of the Agent
(a) The Agent shall represent the Bondholders in accordance with the Finance Documents including, inter alia, holding the Upstream Guarantee on behalf of the Bondholders and, where relevant, enforcing the Upstream Guarantee on behalf of the Bondholders.
