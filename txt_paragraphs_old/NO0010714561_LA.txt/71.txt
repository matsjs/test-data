(e) If any of the insurances referred to in paragraph (a) above have been taken out on conditions other than the Nordic Marine Insurance Plan and/or form part of a fleet cover, the Issuer shall make its best efforts to procure that the insurers undertake to the Bond Trustee that they shall neither set-off against any claims in respect of the Rig any premiums due in respect of other rigs under such fleet cover or any premiums due for other insurances, nor cancel this insurance for reason of non-payment of premium for other rigs under such fleet cover or of premiums for such other insurances, and shall issue a separate policy in respect of the Rig.
(f) The Issuer shall not make any material change to the insurances described under paragraphs (a) and (b) above if such change may have a Material Adverse Effect.
