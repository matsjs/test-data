(g) No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds.
The Issuer shall use the proceeds from the issue of the Bonds, less the Transaction Costs for refinancing of the Existing Debt (amounting to approximately EUR 40,000,000) and repayment of shareholder loans and other subordinated loans of the Issuer in the approximate amount of EUR 38,000,000. The remainder shall be applied towards general corporate purposes.
4. Conditions Precedent for Disbursement
(a) The Issuer shall provide to the Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent (acting reasonably):
13
(i) duly executed release notice(s) from the lender(s) under the Existing Debt confirming that all Existing Security will be released upon repayment of the Existing Debt;
(ii) evidence that the Net Proceeds shall be applied towards repayment in full of the Existing Debt in accordance with the Purpose of the Bonds; and
(iii) duly executed copies of the Security Documents.
(b) When the conditions precedent for disbursement set out above have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the Agent (acting reasonably), the Agent shall transfer the funds from the Escrow Account for the purpose of repayment in full of the Existing Debt and in accordance with the Purpose of the Bonds. The Agent shall transfer any residual funds of the Net Proceeds on the Escrow Account after the repayment of the Existing Debt, to a bank account specified by the Issuer. For the avoidance of doubt, the Net Proceeds relating to the issuance of any Subsequent Bonds shall not be transferred to the Escrow Account.
