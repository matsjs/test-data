It is or becomes impossible or unlawful for the Issuer to fulfil or perform any of the provisions of the Finance Documents to which it is a party or if the obligations under any Finance Documents to which it is a party are not, or cease to be, legal, valid, binding and enforceable.
The Issuer or any other Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business (other than in the case of (i) a merger or demerger as stipulated Clause 15.6 (Mergers and Demergers) or (ii) a disposal of assets which is permitted in accordance with Clause 14.5 (Disposal ofAssets)).

15.10 Acceleration of the Bonds
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred, the Agent is entitled to, on behalf of the Bondholders (i) by notice to the Issuer, declare ail, but not only some, of the Bonds due for payment together with any other amounts payable under the Finance Documents, immediately or at such later date as the Agent determines (but such date may not fall after the Final Maturity Date), and (ii) exercise any or all of its rights, remedies, powers and discretions under the Finance Documents.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions in these Terms and Conditions, acceleration of the Bonds on the grounds mentioned in Clause 15.2 (Other Obligations) above or, regarding any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Clauses 15.4 {Insolvency) to and including Clause 15.9 ((Continuation of the Business), above may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration of acceleration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under Clause 15.4 (Insolvency) above.
(c) If the Bondholders instruct the Agent to accelerate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds due and payable and take such actions as, in the opinion of the Agent, may be necessary or desirable to enforce the rights of the Bondholders under the Finance Documents, unless the relevant Event of Default is no longer continuing.
(d) If the right to accelerate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of acceleration to be deemed to exist.
(e) In the event of an acceleration of the Bonds in accordance with this Clause 15, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount equal to the redemption amount specified in Clause 10.3 (Voluntary Total Redemption), as applicable considering when the acceleration occurs.
