"Financial Statements" means the audited consolidated annual accounts and financial statements of the Issuer for any financial year, drawn up according to GAAP, such accounts to include a profit and loss account, balance sheet, cash flow statement and report from the Board of Directors.
"GAAP" means the generally accepted accounting practice and principles in the country in which the Issuer is incorporated including, if applicable, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and guidelines and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (or any predecessor and successor thereof), in force from time to time. In case of any changes being introduced to IFRS after the date of this Bond Agreement, the Issuer and the Trustee shall jointly conduct a review of the impact of such changes for the Issuer (including, without limitations, whether such changes would have any impact on the financial covenants in Clause 13.5), and, if relevant, the parties shall enter into such amendments to the Bond Agreement as may be required to arrive at the same financial covenants in Clause 13.5 as if no such changes to IFRS had been introduced.
