Further, after such Quarter Date and for the following nine (9) months, EBITDA related to such New Rig shall be annualized (meaning that for a New Rig the first full financial quarter since contract startup shall be annualized by multiplying such EBITDA by 4x, while the first two full financial quarters shall be annualized by a multiple of 2x and so forth).
