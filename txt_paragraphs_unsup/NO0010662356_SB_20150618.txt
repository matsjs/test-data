reporting requirements with respect to the annual financial statements within the relevant timeframes. The waivers that will be required in respect of the defaults and anticipated defaults referred to herein are further described under section

<<<

 3 below. 1.3. Reorganisation Furthermore, the Issuer is contemplating a reorganisation of its holding company structure in order to obtain a more efficient and manageable structure which will allow a more efficient administration and future

<<<

 growth (the "Reorganisation"). As part of the planned Reorganisation and to enable the Group to optimise the structuring of its business and the corporate structure of the Group, the Issuer and Solör Bioenergi Holding AB are of the opinion

<<<

 that it is in the best interest of the Group to have both debtor positions in the holding company of the Group, Solör Bioenergi Holding AB. This will amongst others lead to the Group reporting covenants on one level, the holding company of

<<<

 the Group. Furthermore, as part of the planned Reorganisation, the Group is to be organized with a structure where the Swedish entities are direct subsidiaries of Solör Bioenergi Holding AB. Solør Bioenergi Sverige AB and Solør Bioenergi Recycling

<<<

 AB (together with their respective subsidiaries collectively referred to as the "Swedish Subsidiaries") may be transferred to a new Swedish Holdco as further described in the Permitted Restructuring clause of the Bond Agreement. As Solör Bioenergi

<<<

 Holding AB is planned to be the new issuer under the Bond Issue, it does not seem necessary to include a Swedish Holdco as the owner of the Swedish Subsidiaries, and therefore the Swedish Subsidiaries will be transferred directly to Solör Bioenergi

<<<

 Holding AB on arm's length terms and with a purchase price equivalent to the fair market value. For the sake of good order, the Issuer will ask for consent in this respect from the Bondholders. For information purposes, the existing structure

<<<

 is set out in figure 1 below and the proposed structure is set out in figure 2 below:
Figure 1 ­ Existing Group structure

Figure 2 ­ Proposed amended Group structure
The shares in the Swedish Subsidiaries have been pledged as security for

<<<

 the Issuer's obligations under the Bond Issue. The transfer of the shares in Solør Bioenergi Sverige AB and Solør Bioenergi Recycling AB will therefore be made subject to the existing security created under the relevant Share Pledge Agreement

<<<

. In order to document that the transfer is made subject to the existing security and that Solör Bioenergi Holding AB assumes the Issuer's obligations under the relevant Share Pledge Agreement, Solör Bioenergi Holding AB will issue a security

<<<

 confirmation letter in connection with the share transfer. The arrangement will ensure that the share transfer does not have an adverse effect on the existing security created over the shares in Solør Bioenergi Sverige AB and Solør Bioenergi

<<<

 Recycling AB. As consideration for the Bondholders' granting the waivers and consents requested in this summons, Solör Bioenergi Holding AB will provide new security over all the shares issued by SBH Acquisition AB once the Reorganisation has

<<<

 been completed (the "Rindi Share Security"). SBH Acquisition AB is the shareholder of 99.91 per cent of the shares in Rindi Energi AB. The Rindi Share Security will be pledged to the Bondholders and to the bondholders under the SEK Bond (the

<<<

 "SEK Bondholders") on a pro rata basis. The Rindi Share Security will be provided on substantially the following terms (to be documented in a share pledge agreement containing intercreditor provisions): (a) the security will be held by Nordic

<<<

 Trustee & Agency AB (publ) as security agent (the "SEK Bond
Trustee") on behalf of the Bondholders and the bondholders under the SEK Bond and the SEK Bond Trustee will benefit from substantially similar limitation of liability, rights and protections

<<<

 as under the terms and conditions of the SEK Bond; (b) the proceeds from an enforcement of the Rindi Share Security will be shared by the Bondholders and the SEK Bondholders pari passu and pro rata, calculated on the total outstanding amount

<<<

 under the respective bond on the date that the security is granted; (c) each of the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) and the SEK Bond Trustee (on behalf of the SEK Bondholders) shall be entitled to initiate enforcement over the Rindi

<<<

 Share Security; (d) a 40 days' consultation period will apply unless the Bondholders and the SEK Bondholders agree otherwise. If no agreement is reached during the consultation period, the bond with the largest outstanding amount at the time

<<<

 (represented by the agent/trustee for that bond) has the right to give enforcement instructions to the SEK Bond Trustee; and (e) in the case of refinancing of either the Bonds or the SEK Bond, the new debt shall be entitled to share the Rindi

<<<

 Share Security on the same terms as the bond that was refinanced.

1.4. Listing
The SEK Bond is scheduled to be listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. The Group wants to be able to list both the SEK Bond and Bond Issue on the same stock exchange and

<<<

 therefore propose to allow for listing on Nasdaq Stockholm also for the Bond Issue.
The Company proposes that the Bondholders provide certain waivers and agree to the amendments set out in section 2 and 3 below.

2. PROPOSAL

To enable the

<<<

 Issuer to make the proposed amendments of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has requested the Trustee to summon a Bondholders' Meeting to consider the approval of the following proposed amendments (the "Proposal"):

2.1. Amendment of Issuer

Based

<<<

2.2. Guarantee from Solør Bioenergi Holding AS

The Issuer will issue an unconditional and irrevocable on demand guarantee (Norwegian: "påkravsgaranti") for the Bonds in favour of the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders

2.3. Financial Covenants 2.3.1. Background

As set out in the Company Presentation, the Issuer may not be able

 in the covenant levels. The Issuer has also proposed that an equity cure is introduced in the Bond Agreement whereby the sponsors have the right to cure a breach of the Financial Covenants by way of injecting cash into Solør Bioenergi Holding

<<<

 AB (as new issuer).

Based on the background information set out above, the Issuer proposes to change the Equity Ratio covenant in Clause 13.5 a) as follows:

2.4. Amendment to listing Based on the background information set out above, the Issuer proposes to amend Clause 3.1 and 3.2 as follows:
"The Issuer shall apply for listing of the Bonds on Oslo Børs or Nasdaq Stockholm and shall ensure

<<<

 that all relevant listing requirements are complied with, including, without limitation, any additional information requirements on the Primary Holdco or any other Group Company following a Permitted Restructuring."
"If the Bonds are listed

<<<

, the Issuer shall ensure that the Bonds remain listed on Oslo Børs or Nasdaq Stockholm until they have been discharged in full."

<<<

Presentation to Bondholders in the NOK 650 million bond issued by Solør Bioenergi Holding AS and the SEK 950 million bond issued by Solör Bioenergi Holding AB
June 18, 2015

Background
· Solör Bioenergi Holding AB (the "Company") and its subsidiaries

<<<

 (together the "Solør Group") have two bonds outstanding; the NOK 650 million bond issued by Solør Bioenergi Holding AS (the "NOK Bond") and the SEK 950 million bond issued by Solör Bioenergi Holding AB (the "SEK Bond")
· On 27 April 2015, Solør

<<<

 Group issued a press release in relation to recognition of income associated with excess values from acquisitions made by the Solør Group in 2014
· The press release was a result of extensive reviews by the Company's auditor who concluded that

<<<

 the acquisitions of Rindi Energi AB and the E.ON portfolio in 2014 did not qualify for recognition of excess values based on a "bargain purchase" approach under IFRS
· Consequently, the financial statements for 2014 for both Solør Bioenergi

<<<

 Holding AS and Solör Bioenergi Holding AB will be corrected and the income recognition of excess value amounting to SEK 891 million will be reversed
· This reversal requires an accounting process that will delay the publication of audited annual

<<<

 accounts for 2014 originally scheduled for 30 April 2015
· Following the above, the Solør Group is unable to comply with the financial covenants "Equity Ratio", "Current Ratio" and "Interest Coverage Ratio" as set out in the respective bond

<<<

 agreements
· The covenant breaches are only temporary, and relate mainly to accounting treatment, and will in the Company's opinion not affect Solør Group's underlying operations, cash flow, debt servicing ability, or credit quality going forward

<<<


· However, as the Solør Group are in breach of its obligations under both the NOK Bond and SEK Bond, the Company has proposed to the bondholders certain amendments and waivers as described in the summons letter and the written notice to bondholders

<<<

 dated 18 June 2015
· The Company has in the following presentation described in more detail the background for the proposal in addition to a general update of the Solør Group's operational and financial performance
