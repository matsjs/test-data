2. BACKGROUND
In December 2009, the Company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with

<<<

 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. and OSG America, LP (collectively "OSG") that settled all of the outstanding commercial disputes between AMSC and OSG (the "OSG Settlement Agreement"). The OSG Settlement Agreement enabled the Company to complete

<<<

 the twelve vessel build series with Aker Philadelphia Shipyard ("AKPS") and remain a going concern.
The agreement is a complex agreement which subsequently was approved by all necessary third parties including U.S. Coast Guard, being the relevant

<<<

 regulatory authority of the Jones Act. The highlights of the agreement are as follows:
· The fixed term of the bareboat charters of the ten product tankers will be extended to one common expiration date in December 2019 (ten years from the

<<<

 settlement date) upon satisfaction of certain conditions (see below)
® The sale of two shuttle tanker shipbuilding contracts to OSG for USD 35 million each
® Changes to the profit sharing agreements · OSG purchase rights to the product tankers

<<<

 if certain triggers occur (OSG has
currently no purchase rights) ® Additional liquidity provided by Converto Capital Fund to the Company through
an unsecured subordinated loan of USD 20 million with Payment-In-Kind interest ® Dismissal of the

<<<

 arbitration with OSG
A key element of the Settlement Agreement is the extension of the bareboat charters with OSG subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, namely:
1. Timely delivery of the remaining vessels in the twelve ship order. This

<<<

 condition was met by the delivery of the last vessel in Q2 2011.
2. The refinancing or extension of AMSC's senior vessel debt. The Company has started a dialogue with the providers of its senior bank debt and aims to finalize this process well

<<<

 in advance of maturity and in compliance with the conditions of the OSG Settlement Agreement.
3. Refinancing or extension of the current bond obligation for a minimum of 6 years from the original maturity date being 28 February 2012. This has

<<<

 to be effected by no later than 90 days before this date, i.e., 28 November 2011. Moreover, AMSC must elect to pay PIK interest and may only pay cash interest under certain circumstances.
By securing the charter extensions, the Borrower's contract

<<<

 backlog will increase by more than 100% or USD 379 million to a total contract backlog of USD 708 million.
A more detailed description of the OSG Settlement Agreement is included in the enclosed presentation.

 TRUSTEE
The Company has been evaluating different alternatives for refinancing the Bond Issue. Based on the existing financial situation of the Company and the prevailing conditions in the international capital markets, the Company has come

<<<

 to the conclusion that the best available option is to extend the maturity of the existing Bond.
Consequently, the Company has requested Norsk Tillitsmann to convene a Bondholder meeting to consider a proposal to restructure the Bond Issue

<<<

 (the "Restructuring Proposal") as described in detail below.
3. THE RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
The Company proposes a resolution to be passed by the Bondholders, whereby the Bond Agreement is amended as follows:
(i) Extension of the Maturity Date

<<<

 of the Bond Issue by six years, from 28 February 2012 to 28 February 2018.
(ii) The Borrower may in its sole discretion make any of the interest payments until the Maturity Date in the form of additional Bonds (Payment-in-Kind).
(iii) The financial

<<<

 covenant applicable to the Borrower's minimum equity requirement as set forth in Clause 13.2 (a) in the Bond Agreement and as amended in the Bondholders' meeting 25 March 2011 shall be deleted.
(iv) Upon the approval of the Restructuring Proposal

<<<

, a compensation of 0.1 percent flat of the outstanding amount under the Bond Agreement shall be due and payable to the Bondholders.
4. COMPANY UPDATE
For an update please see Annex B. For additional information about the Company please visit

<<<

 the Company's web site www.americanshipt)ingco.com for access to the latest quarterly presentations and reports.
5. EVALUATION OF THE RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
AMCS' evaluation: The Borrower believes that the Restructuring Proposal is the best

<<<

 possible solution available for all stakeholders including the Bondholders in view of the Company's financial situation and the prevailing conditions in the capital markets. Non-compliance with the conditions for extension under the OSG Settlement

<<<

 Agreement will have the effect that the bareboat charters retain their original terms and a less robust contract backlog will severely diminish the Company's prospects of a successful refinancing of the senior bank debt.
On the contrary, if

<<<

 successful, the charter extensions would increase the Company's backlog by USD 379 million to a total of USD 708 million and pave the way for a
3

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
refinancing of the senior bank debt and improve the Company

<<<

's future ability to service its bond debt.
According to the Company's projections, and inter alia due to the PIK interest of the Bond, the Company's leverage will increase over time and the Company's ability to meet the existing equity covenant

<<<

 will be challenging. The Company's Board of Directors has full focus on the Company's capital structure and the equity situation. Accordingly, the Board recommends that the Bondholders vote in favor the Restructuring Proposal as described in

<<<

 Clause 3.
The Company has informed the Trustee that it has received pre-acceptance in favor of the Restructuring Proposal in respect of bonds representingjnore than 75% of the total outstanding amount of the Bond Issue.
Non-reliance of Trustee

<<<

:
Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Trustee. Bondholders should independently evaluate the Proposal and seek such additional advice as they may deem appropriate and vote accordingly.
6. SUMMONS FOR BONDHOLDERS

The Restructuring Proposal (cont.)

The Company's evaluation of the Restructuring Proposal
The Company

<<<

 has recently been evaluating different alternatives for refinancing the Bond Issue
- Current market conditions in the international capital markets makes a refinancing of the existing bond issue challenging
- To issue significant equity based

<<<

 on the current financial position and capital structure of AMSC is not possible
1 1 - Furthermore, the lease finance exception to the Jones Act ownership restrictions make it currently impossible for Converto to increase its ownership stake

<<<


AMSC believes that the Restructuring Proposal is the best possible solution available for the Bondholders in view of the Company's financial situation
Non-compliance with the terms of the OSG Settlement Agreement will have the effect that the

<<<

 bareboat charters retain their original terms and a less robust contract backlog will severely diminish the Company's prospects of a successful refinancing of the senior bank debt

Key considerations for bondholders
Charter extension is conditional

<<<

 upon a refinancing or extension of the existing bond issue
- Charter extension will lead to an increase in charter backlog by ~115%
- The increased charter backlog will give increased cash flow visibility until 2019
- Industry fundamentals

<<<

 appear to be improving; charter extensions will lead to a further potential for profit sharing
Repayment of the bonds at the original Maturity Date is not a viable option
- Current cash flow and cash position not sufficient
- The charter extension

<<<

 is essential for continuing operations
- Uncertain what values Bondholders can realize in case of a wind-down today
Extension of the maturity of the bond issue is expected to result in a value creation for bondholders and will improve the Company

- OSG currently has time charter contracts in place with Shell, BP, Tesoro and Chevron

Industry fundamentals appear to be improving; increasing rates could lead AMSC into profit sharing territory
-

<<<

 Profit sharing agreement includes potential for profit split which will become attributable to AMSC in the event that OSG's time charter rates exceed certain de' ined levels

The bank debt will be reduced over time, which combined with potential

 profit sharing could open up for cash flow which __ can service the bond debt in the future

*The increased backlog is the net effect of charter extensions for nine vessels and charter reduction for one vessel.

Comments

In 1990, the U.S. product tanker and ITB fleet (16-55KDWT) totaled approximately 100 vessels. The attention to environmental issues after the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 and the subsequent Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) led to an accelerated

 retirement of single-hull vessels
- 64 product tanker or ITB vessels at the end of Q1 2011

The retirement schedule based on OPA 90 provides a retirement date for each single-hull vessel, which has reduced the fleet considerably

 consultant Wilson Gillette's assessment of future tonnage balance for product tankers and oceangoing barges assumes a return to moderate trade growth and retirement of most older vessels in the near term

- Domestic fleet expected to over-adjust

- Increased tonnage requirements in West Coast products trade

As over-tonnaging is short-lived and capacity shortfalls becomes more evident, it is expected that the capital

 cost associated with adding newbuilds to the fleet will exert positive pressure on TC rates

U.S. Jones Act

 The U.S. cabotage law / Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act

Ownership restrictions
AMSC's shares are freely transferable; however,

 the transferability of shares is subject to certain voting and ownership restrictions due to the fact that the Company is operating under the lease finance exception to the U.S ownership requirement in the Jones Act
 Based on AMSC's ownership

 of the vessels under the lease finance exception and based on interpretative rulings obtained by AMSC from the US Coast Guard:
- No single Shipping Operator may own more than 20% of the Company's shares outstanding from time to time or acquire

 shares such that the single Shipping Operator becomes the owner of more than 20% of the Company's shares outstanding from time to time
- Shipping Operators in the aggregate shall not be permitted to own more than 49% of the Company's shares

 outstanding from time to time or acquire shares such that Shipping Operators in the aggregate become the owners of more than 49% of the Company's shares outstanding from time to time.
- The term "Shipping Operator" shall mean a person or entity

 that operates any vessel for hire or directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with any Company or person who operates any vessel for hire.
