RISK FACTORS
Prospective investors should read the entire Prospectus and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.

The Issuer believes that the following

<<<

 factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. All of these factors are contingencies that may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring

<<<

.

Factors which the Issuer believes may be materialfor the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are also described below.

The Issuer believes that thefactors described below represent the principal risks inherent

<<<

 in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently

<<<

 available to it and which it may not currently be able to anticipate.
The following is a general discussion o f certain risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes. In particular, it does not consider

<<<

 an investor's specific knowledge and/or understanding about risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes, whether obtained through experience, training or otherwise, or the lack o f such specific

<<<

 knowledge and/or understanding, or circumstances that may apply to a particular investor.
Words and expressions defined in the "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes" below or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same meanings in this section

<<<

, unless otherwise stated. References to a numbered "Condition"shall be to the relevant Condition in the Terms and Conditions o f the Notes.

Risks relating to the Issuer
The Group is exposed to a number o f risks, the categories o f which are

<<<

 credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, insurance risk andpension risk

The Group is exposed to a number of risks, which it manages at different organisational levels. The categories of risk are as follows:

 Credit risk

<<<

: Credit risk is the risk of losses arising because debtors or counterparties fail to meet all or part of their payment obligations.

 Market risk: Market risk is defined as the risk of losses because the fair value of financial assets, liabilities

<<<

 and off-balance-sheet items varies with market conditions.

Liquidity risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of losses arising because:



funding costs become excessive;



a lack of funding prevents the Group from maintaining its current business

<<<

 model; or



a lack of funding prevents the Group from fulfilling its payment obligations.

Operational risk: Operational risk is the risk of losses resulting from inadequate internal procedures, human or system errors, or external events.

<<<

 Operational risk includes legal risk.

 Insurance risk: Insurance risk in the Group is defined as all types of risk in the Danica group (which consists of the Issuer's subsidiary, Forsikringsselskabet Danica, Skadeforsikringsaktieselskab af

<<<

 1999, which is the parent company of Danica Pension Livsforsikringsaktieselskab and its respective subsidiaries), including market risk, and life insurance risk.

10

 Pension risk: Pension risk arises because of the Group's liability for

<<<

 defined benefit pension plans. Valuation is uncertain because this type of pension plan entails protracted liabilities and is based on actuarial assumptions. Pension risk includes, inter alia, risks of the following:



lower-than-expected

<<<

 returns on invested funds;



changes in actuarial assumptions, including the assumptions about the discount rate and

inflation, that cause an increase in the pension obligations; or



longer-than-expected longevity among members of the plan

<<<

.

Regulatory changes could materially affect the Issuer's business

The Issuer is subject to financial services laws, regulations, administrative actions and policies in Denmark and in each other jurisdiction in which the Issuer carries on

<<<

 business. Changes in supervision and regulation, in particular in Denmark, could materially affect the Issuer's business, the products and services offered or the value of its assets. Although the Issuer works closely with its regulators and

<<<

 continually monitors the situation, future changes in regulation, fiscal or other policies can be unpredictable and are beyond the control of the Issuer.

The Issuer is subject to risks as a result of implementation of the European Banking

<<<

 Union. The Group has entities both within and outside the eurozone. Accordingly, these risks could include the outcome of the ECB asset quality review to be performed in 2014 on entities within the eurozone as well as the manner in which the

<<<

 Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (the "DFSA") may implement a similar review of the Group.

The Issuer willface increased capital and liquidity requirements as a result o f the new Basel III Framework
The final versions of the Regulation

<<<

 of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (the "CRR") and the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions

<<<

 and investment firms (the "CRD IV Directive") were adopted in June 2013. The CRR entered into force on 1 January 2014, and the CRD IV Directive is anticipated to be implemented in Denmark in 2014. The framework implements among other things

<<<

 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposals imposing stricter capital and liquidity requirements upon banks ("Basel III") in the EU. Each of the CRR and the CRD IV Directive covers a wide range of prudent requirements for banks across

<<<

 EU member states, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), leverage ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements. The CRD IV Directive covers the overall

<<<

 supervisory framework for banks (including the individual risk assessment) and other measures such as the combined capital buffer requirements, SIFI (as defined below) definition, governance and remuneration requirements.
The regulatory impact

<<<

 on the Issuer's core equity tier 1 is expected to be moderate (-1.9 percentage points as of 1 January 2014) and will arise from the changed rules of deductions. The new rules will also have a moderate impact on the RWA. According to the CRR

<<<

, instruments that no longer qualify as additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital shall be subject to grandfathering, which means that such instruments will be phased out during a 10year period.
CRD IV includes a requirement for credit institutions

<<<

 to calculate, report and monitor their leverage ratios, defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of total exposure. The leverage ratios will be assessed under Pillar II (as defined in CRD IV) pending a subsequent political decision in the

<<<

 European Union on whether this should be a Pillar I (as defined in CRD IV).
The CRD IV Directive will come into force through implementation in the Danish Financial Business Act, whereas the CRR applies directly without implementation in national

<<<

 law. The phase-in of the capital requirements will follow the path in the CRR until 2018 unless required earlier in applicable Danish legislation. The European Banking Authority ("EBA") will propose detailed rules through binding technical

<<<

 standards during the period 2014 to 2016 for many areas including, inter alia, liquidity requirements and certain aspects of capital requirements.

11

For each systemically important financial institution ("SIFI"), there will be additional

<<<

 capital requirements beyond the minimum requirements. In October 2013 a political agreement on SIFI requirements was reached in Denmark. In the agreement, which is expected to be implemented into Danish law in 2014, the Issuer has been designated

<<<

 as a SIFI. According to the agreement, this will require the Issuer to comply with an additional CET1 (as defined below) capital requirement of 3 per cent. The intention is for the capital requirements imposed on Danish SIFIs to be on a par

<<<

 with the requirements set in other comparable European countries. Accordingly the final level of the Danish SIFI capital requirements will be assessed no later than 2017 after evaluating these other countries' final requirements. Regulations

<<<

 for the crisis management of Danish SIFIs and other banks and mortgage-credit institutions will not be established until forthcoming common EU crisis management regulations have been agreed upon, in particular the RRD and SRM (both as defined

<<<

 below) proposals, including whether there should be additional requirements for Danish banks to issue debt that can be bailed-in. The agreement specifically states that it is not the intention that Danish SIFIs shall be resolved pursuant to

<<<

 Bank Package III (as defined in "Description of the Danske Bank Group" below). A position on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") requirement for Danish SIFIs awaits the European Commission's decision in 2014 on the final definition of the

<<<

 LCR requirement, including clarification of which assets can be used in complying with the LCR requirement, in particular whether Danish covered bonds can be used. All SIFIs must comply with the LCR requirement by 2015.
The DFSA has also made

<<<

 orders against the Issuer concerning its use of the internal ratings-based approach in capital adequacy calculations, as set out in the "Description of the Danske Bank Group" section. The Issuer does not agree with some of the DFSA's orders

<<<

 and has appealed to the Company Appeals Board.
See "Description of the Danske Bank Group" for a description of the impact on the Group of the new capital and liquidity requirements and, if the Issuer is unsuccessful in its appeal to the Company

<<<

 Appeals Board, the consequences of the orders from the DFSA.
The Group may have to pay additional amounts under deposit guarantee schemes or resolution funds
In Denmark and other jurisdictions, deposit guarantee schemes and similar funds (

<<<

"Deposit Guarantee Schemes") have been implemented from which compensation for deposits may become payable to customers of financial services firms in the event a financial services firm is unable to pay, or unlikely to pay, claims against it

<<<

. In most jurisdictions in which the Group operates, these Deposit Guarantee Schemes are funded, directly or indirectly, by financial services firms which operate and/or are licensed in the relevant jurisdiction. Revised legislation regarding

<<<

 the Danish Deposit Guarantee Scheme (Bank Package IV (as defined below) and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive) redefines the Danish scheme as a premium based scheme such that the participating banks' payments to the scheme will be more

<<<

 stable every year in profit and loss terms. The premium payments will stop when a target level of 1 per cent. of covered net deposits has been reached. The future target level of funds to be accumulated in Deposit Guarantee Schemes and resolution

<<<

 funds across different EU countries may exceed the minimum target levels provided for in the RRD, the proposal for a repeal and recast of Directive 94/19/EC (the "revised Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive") and in discussions on a single

<<<

 resolution fund according to the proposal for a regulation establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single

<<<

 Resolution Fund published by the European Commission on 10 July 2013 (the "SRM") (the latter of which will be relevant should Denmark choose to participate in the Single Resolution Mechanism). The final texts o f the RRD, the revised Deposit

<<<

 Guarantee Schemes Directive and the SRM are anticipated to be published in the first half of 2014, to be followed by entry into force of each of those proposals and the transposition into national legislation o f the RRD and the revised Deposit

<<<

 Guarantee Schemes Directive.
The Group may be affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions
The financial services industry generally prospers in conditions of economic growth, stable geopolitical conditions, capital markets that

<<<

 are transparent, liquid and buoyant, and positive investor sentiment. Each of the Group's operating segments is affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions, which can cause the Group's results of operations and financial position

<<<

 to fluctuate from year to year as well as on a long-term basis.
12

The Danish economy picked up throughout 2013. Gross domestic product rose in the second and third quarters, and economic indicators suggest that growth continued towards the

<<<

 end of the year. Growth was stimulated by increasing exports, real wage growth and low interest rates. Exports are expected to continue to increase in 2014. Housing prices started to rise, but the turnaround is weak and the housing market remains

<<<

 a risk factor.
The Swedish economy did not grow in 2013. Survey data indicates that it might expand in 2014 because of the outlook for higher global growth. Housing prices have risen sharply in recent years, and even taking into account the

<<<

 strong underlying economy, the high prices pose a risk of corrections in the years ahead.
The Norwegian economy remains strong, but growth has slowed markedly because of lower oil prices and a lacklustre housing market. As oil prices remain

<<<

 high, despite a drop from their peak, the deceleration is expected to be temporary. Export growth and a continuation of strong domestic demand are expected to underpin the economy. Housing prices fell in the second half of 2013, and the possibility

<<<

 of a further decline is a risk factor.
The Finnish economy saw economic contraction again in 2013 because of weak exports and a tight fiscal policy. Housing prices have been quite flat. The Group expects a slight pickup in growth in 2014.
In

<<<

 Northern Ireland, the Group saw low growth in 2013. The Irish economy is still fragile, but the Irish government has decided to exit the eurozone bailout programme without a European Stability Mechanism precautionary backstop as the public

<<<

 deficit has been reduced significantly. Housing prices appear to have bottomed out at 50 per cent. below their peak and have now started to rise.
Risks related to the market generally
Set out below is a brief description of certain market risks

<<<

, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk:
The secondary market generally
The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not

<<<

 be liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect

<<<

 on the market value of Notes.
Exchange rate risks and exchange controls
Payment of principal and interest on the Notes will be made in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities

<<<

 are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of euro or revaluation of the

<<<

 Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency or euro may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to euro would decrease (i) the

<<<

 Investor's Currencyequivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (iii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities

<<<

 may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal as measured in the

<<<

 Investor's Currency.
Interest rate risks
Notwithstanding that the rate of interest applicable to the Notes will be reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date thereafter, an investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent

<<<

 changes in market interest
13

rates during the Initial Period or, as the case may be, during a Reset Interest Period may adversely affect the value of the Notes.
In addition, a holder of securities with a fixed interest rate that will be

<<<

 periodically reset during the term of the relevant securities, such as the Notes, is also exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income.
Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market

<<<

 risks associated with the Notes
The Notes may not be a suitable investmentfor all investors
Each potential investor of the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential

<<<

 investor should:
(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any

<<<

 applicable supplement to this Prospectus including, but not limited to, any taxation issues related to purchasing and/or holding the Notes;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its

<<<

 particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the

<<<

 Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments, i.e. euro, is different from the currency in which such potential investor's financial activities are principally denominated;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the

<<<

 Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and
(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that

<<<

 may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Risks related to the structure of the Notes
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are subordinated
Subject to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event

<<<

 and Reinstatement o f the Notes), the Notes will constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer as described in Condition 4 (Status o f the Notes).
The Issuer may issue other obligations or capital instruments

<<<

 that rank or are expressed to rank senior to the Notes or pari passu to the Notes, in each case as regards the right to receive periodic payments (to the extent any such periodic payment has not been cancelled) on a liquidation or bankruptcy

<<<

 of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer will be required to pay its depositors, its unsubordinated creditors

<<<

 and its other subordinated creditors other than the present or future claims of creditors that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes in full before it can make any payments on the Notes. If this occurs, the Issuer

<<<

 may not have enough assets remaining after these payments are made to pay amounts due under the Notes.
Loss absorption following a Trigger Event
The Notes are being issued for regulatory capital adequacy purposes with the intention and purpose

<<<

 of being eligible as Additional Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer and the Group. Such eligibility depends upon a number of conditions being satisfied, which are reflected in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and which, in particular,
14

require

<<<

 the Notes and the proceeds of their issue to be available to absorb any losses of the Issuer and/or the Group.
Accordingly, if at any time the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group has fallen below 7.000 per cent

<<<

., the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall be reduced as described in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement o f the Notes).
Holders may lose all or some of their investment as a result of such a reduction to

<<<

 the Outstanding Principal Amounts. Any such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall not constitute an Enforcement Event and, following such reduction, Holders' claims in respect of principal will, in all cases, be based on the

<<<

 reduced Outstanding Principal Amounts to the extent the Outstanding Principal Amounts have not subsequently been reinstated as described in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement o f the Notes).
In addition

<<<

, following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest can only continue to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amounts following such reduction, which will be lower than the Original Principal Amount of the

<<<

 Notes.
Following any such reduction, the Issuer will not in any circumstances be obliged to reinstate the Outstanding Principal Amounts, but any reinstatement must be undertaken, subject to compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions

<<<

, on a pro-rata basis with all other Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) which would, following such reinstatement, constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital and feature similar reinstatement provisions.
The market price of the Notes

<<<

 is expected to be affected by fluctuations in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group. Any indication that the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group is trending towards 7.000 per cent

<<<

. may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. The level of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes.
Investors should note that, while such

<<<

 a reduction is not common, it is an appreciable risk and is not limited to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Danish resolution regimes
In Denmark, certain schemes were introduced in recent years to facilitate the orderly resolution

<<<

 of distressed banking institutions. The current Danish banking schemes do not contain any provisions that contemplate a statutory write down (or other similar impairment) of subordinated bank liabilities such as the Notes. The schemes, however

<<<

, allow, inter alia, the Danish government to establish a new bank to take over all the assets and liabilities after the initial haircut, if applicable, from failing banks, excluding the failing bank's equity and subordinated capital (such as

<<<

 the Notes), before initiating bankruptcy proceedings against the failing bank. If the Issuer were to become subject to a resolution regime pursuant to such schemes, the Holders may lose some or all of their investment in the Notes. See "Bank

<<<

 Packages" in "Description of the Danske Bank Group" below for a further description of these schemes. It should also be noted that it is currently unclear whether one or more of these schemes will be replaced (in whole or in part) by the proposals

<<<

 outlined in the draft RRD (see also "Loss absorption at the point of non-viability of the Issuer and resolution" risk factor below) and SRM (see also "The Group may have to pay additional amounts under deposit guarantee schemes or resolution

<<<

 funds" section above).
Loss absorption at the point o fnon-viability o f the Issuer and resolution
On 18 December 2013, the Council of the European Union published a revised legislative proposal for a directive providing for the establishment

<<<

 of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the "RRD"). The stated aim of the draft RRD is to provide relevant authorities
15

with common tools and powers to address banking crises

<<<

 pre-emptively in order to safeguard financial stability and minimise taxpayers' exposure to losses.
The powers provided to "resolution authorities" in the draft RRD include write down/conversion powers to ensure capital instruments (including

<<<

 Additional Tier 1 capital instruments such as the Notes) and eligible liabilities (including senior debt instruments) fully absorb losses at the point of non-viability of the issuing institution (referred to as the "Bail-In Tool"). Accordingly

<<<

, the draft RRD contemplates that resolution authorities may require the write down of such capital instruments and eligible liabilities in full on a permanent basis or convert them in full into common equity tier 1 instruments ("RRD Non-Viability

<<<

 Loss Absorption"). The draft RRD currently provides, inter alia, that resolution authorities shall exercise the write down power in a way that results in (i) common equity tier 1 instruments being written down first in proportion to the relevant

<<<

 losses, (ii) thereafter, the principal amount of other capital instruments (including Additional Tier 1 capital instruments such as the Notes) being written down or converted into common equity tier 1 instruments on a permanent basis and (iii

<<<

) thereafter, eligible liabilities being written down or converted in accordance with a set order of priority.
The point of non-viability under the draft RRD is the point at which the national authority determines if the institution meets the

<<<

 condition for resolution, which is defined as:
(a) the institution is failing or likely to fail, which means:
(i) the institution has incurred/will incur in a near future losses depleting all or substantially all its own funds; and/or
(ii)

<<<

 the assets are/will be in a near future less than its liabilities; and/or
(iii) the institution is/will be in a near future unable to pay its debts or other liabilities when they fall due; and/or
(iv) the institution requires public financial

<<<

 support;
(b) there is no reasonable prospect that a private action would prevent the failure; and
(c) a resolution action is necessary in the public interest.
Except for the Bail-In Tool with respect to eligible liabilities, which is expected

<<<

 to apply as from 1 January 2016, the draft RRD contemplates that the measures set out therein, including the Bail-In Tool with respect to capital instruments such as the Notes, will apply as from 1 January 2015.
The draft RRD currently represents

<<<

 the official proposal for the implementation in the European Economic Area of the non-viability requirements set out in the press release dated 13 January 2011 issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") entitled

<<<

 "Minimum requirements to ensure loss absorbency at the point of non-viability" (the "Basel III Non-Viability Requirements"). The Basel III Non Viability Requirements form part of the broader Basel III package of new capital and liquidity requirements

<<<

 (as described above under "Basel III Framework" and in more detail under "European implementation of the Basel III Framework" in "Description of the Danske Bank Group" below) intended to reinforce capital standards and to establish minimum

<<<

 liquidity standards for credit institutions.
The Basel Committee contemplated implementation of the Basel III reforms as of 1 January 2013. However, implementation of these reforms in the European Economic Area has been delayed but will be

<<<

 by way of the CRD IV Directive and the CRR. These texts were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 27 June 2013, became effective on 1 January 2014 (except for capital buffer provisions which shall apply as from 1 January

<<<

 2016) but in practice implementation of the CRD IV Directive has been delayed in many countries including Denmark. The CRR contemplates that the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements will be implemented in the European Economic Area by way of

<<<

 the RRD and the RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption. If such statutory loss absorption at the point of non-viability is not implemented by 31 December 2015, then CRR indicates that the
16

European Commission shall review and report on whether

<<<

 a provision should be included in CRR and, in light of that review, come forward with appropriate legislative proposals.

It is currently unclear whether RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption, when implemented, will apply to capital instruments

<<<

 (such as the Notes) that are already in issue at that time or whether certain grandfathering rules will apply. If and to the extent that such provisions, when implemented, apply to the Notes, and/or if the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements

<<<

 become applicable to the Notes at any time, the Notes may be subject to write down or conversion to common equity tier 1 instruments upon the occurrence of the relevant trigger event, which may result in Holders losing some or all of their

<<<

 investment in the Notes. The exercise of any such power or any suggestion or anticipation of such exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the value of the Notes.

In addition to RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption, the draft RRD

<<<

 provides resolution authorities with broader powers to implement other resolution measures with respect to distressed banks which reach non viability, which may include (without limitation) the sale of the bank's business, the separation of

<<<

 assets, the replacement or substitution of the bank as obligor in respect of debt instruments, modifications to the terms of debt instruments (including altering the maturity and/or the amount of interest payable and/or imposing a temporary

<<<

 suspension on payments) and discontinuing the listing and admission to trading of financial instruments.

The draft RRD is not in final form and changes may be made to it in the course of the legislative process. In addition, as noted above

<<<

, it is unclear whether the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements could be applied in respect of the Notes ahead of implementation of the RRD. Accordingly, it is not yet possible to assess the full impact of the relevant loss absorption provisions

<<<

. There can be no assurance that, once implemented, the availability of applicable loss absorption provisions or the taking of any actions currently contemplated or as finally reflected in such provisions would not adversely affect the price

<<<

 or value of a Holder's investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.

No scheduled redemption

The Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for redemption. The Issuer is under

<<<

 no obligation to redeem the Notes at any time (except as provided in Condition 8 (Redemption and Purchase) and, in any such case, subject always to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.)). There will be no redemption at the option of

<<<

 the Holders.
Cancellation of Interest

Subject as provided in Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), any payment of interest in respect of the Notes shall be payable only out of the Issuer's Distributable Items and:

(i)

may be cancelled, at

<<<

 any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer in its sole discretion;

or

(ii)

will be mandatorily cancelled to the extent so required by the Relevant Rules, including the

applicable criteria for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments

<<<

.

It is currently expected that discretionary payments in respect of certain capital instruments (including payments of interest on the Notes, which would include for the avoidance of doubt, any additional amounts in respect of interest which

<<<

 may be payable under Condition 10 (Taxation)) will be required to be cancelled, in whole or in part, to the extent that:

(i)

Distributable Items are insufficient to make the relevant payment(s);

(ii)

the combined buffer requirement is not

<<<

 met and, if the relevant payment(s) were made, the

amount of such payment(s) would exceed the Maximum Distributable Amount; or

17

(iii)

the Relevant Rules prescribe and/or, as the case may be, the Relevant Regulator requires that the


<<<


relevant payment(s) shall be cancelled.

The Issuer's Distributable Items will depend to a large extent on the net income earned by the Issuer. The Maximum Distributable Amount is a novel concept, and its determination is subject to considerable

<<<

 uncertainty. As discussed above, the Issuer is entitled to cancel payments of interest in its sole discretion and it is permitted to do so even if it could make such payments without exceeding the limits described in the paragraph immediately

<<<

 above. Notwithstanding the above expectations, payments of interest on the Notes may be cancelled even if (i) holders of the Issuer's shares continue to receive dividends and/or (ii) Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes (if any) remain outstanding

<<<

 and holders of those Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes continue to receive interest payments.

Following any cancellation of interest as described above, the right of Holders to receive accrued interest in respect of any such Interest Period

<<<

 will terminate and the Issuer will have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed

<<<

 to have "accrued" or been earned for any purpose nor will the non-payment of such interest constitute an Enforcement Event.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest payments will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of

<<<

 the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation provision of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such

<<<

 cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition.
Notes subject to optional redemption by the Issuer or upon the occurrence o f a Special Event
Subject as provided herein, in particular

<<<

 to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes on the First Call Date or on any Interest Payment Date thereafter at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together

<<<

 with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled. Subject as aforesaid, upon the occurrence of a Special Event, the Issuer may also, at its option, at any time redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes at their

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled.

Holders should note that the Issuer may redeem the Notes as described in the previous paragraph even if (i) the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts have been so reduced and (ii) the principal amount of the Notes has not been fully reinstated to the original principal amount of the Notes.

An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any

<<<

 period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.
The Issuer may be

<<<

 expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest

<<<

 rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
Substitution and variation o f the Notes

<<<

 without Holder consent

Subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), if a Special Event has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer may, at its option, and without the consent or approval of the Holders, elect either (i) to substitute

<<<

 all (but not some only) of the Notes or (ii) to vary the terms of all (but not some only) of the Notes, so that they become or remain Qualifying Capital Notes.

Save to the extent necessary to ensure they continue to comply with the Relevant

<<<

 Rules in relation to Additional Tier 1 Capital, Qualifying Capital Notes are securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer that have,

18

inter alia, terms not materially less favorable to the Holders than the terms of the Notes (provided

<<<

 that the Issuer shall have delivered a certificate to that effect signed by two of its Directors to the Fiscal Agent). See Condition 8.6 (Substitution and variation).
Limited enforcement events
The Notes will contain limited enforcement events

<<<

 relating to:
(i) non-payment by the Issuer of any amounts due under the Notes. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) and subject as provided below, a Holder may institute proceedings in Denmark

<<<

 in order to recover the amounts due from the Issuer to such Holder; and
(ii) the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events), the Notes will become due and

<<<

 payable at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled.
A Holder may not itself file for the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
The calculation o f the Common Equity

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital Ratios will be affected by a number o ffactors, many o f which may be outside the Issuer's control
The occurrence of a Trigger Event and, therefore a write-down of the Original Principal Amounts, is inherently unpredictable and

<<<

 depends on a number of factors, many of which may be outside the Issuer's control. Because the Relevant Regulator may require the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios to be calculated as of any date, a Trigger Event could occur at any time.

<<<

 The calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios of the Issuer and/or the Group could be affected by a wide range of factors, including, among other things, factors affecting the level of the Issuer's and/or the Group's earnings or

<<<

 dividend payments, the mix of businesses, the ability to effectively manage the risk-weighted assets in both the ongoing businesses and those the Issuer and/or the Group may seek to exit, losses in commercial banking, investment banking or

<<<

 other businesses, changes in the Group's structure or organisation, or any of the factors described in "Description of the Danske Bank Group". The calculation of the ratios also may be affected by changes in applicable accounting rules and

<<<

 the manner in which accounting policies are applied, including the manner in which permitted discretion is under the applicable accounting rules is exercised.
Due to the uncertainty regarding whether a Trigger Event will occur, it will be difficult

<<<

 to predict when, if at all, the Original Principal Amounts may be written down. Accordingly, the trading behavior of the Notes may not necessarily follow the trading behavior of other types of subordinated securities. Any indication that the

<<<

 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of either the Issuer or of the Group is approaching the level that would trigger a Trigger Event may have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes. Under such circumstances, investors

<<<

 may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to more conventional investments.
Uncertainties remain regarding the manner in which CRD IV will be implemented
The defined terms in the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions of the Notes will depend in some cases on the final interpretation and implementation of CRD IV. CRD IV is a recently-adopted set of rules and regulations that imposes a series of new requirements, many of which will be

<<<

 phased in over a number of years. Certain portions of the CRD IV Directive require transposition into Danish law, and although the CRD IV Regulation will be directly applicable in each Member State, the CRD IV Regulation leaves a number of

<<<

 important interpretational issues to be resolved through binding technical standards that will be adopted in the future, and leaves certain other matters to the discretion of the Relevant Regulator. The manner in which the framework and requirements

<<<

 under CRD IV will be applied to the Issuer and the Group remains uncertain.
19

The determination of the Maximum Distributable Amount is particularly complex. The Maximum Distributable Amount imposes a cap on the Issuer's ability to pay interest

<<<

 on the Notes, and on the Issuer's ability to reinstate the Original Principal Amounts following a reduction upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event.
Risks related to the Notes generally
Because the Notes are held by or on behalf o f Euroclear

<<<

 and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on the clearing system procedures for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg

<<<

. Except in the circumstances described in the Global Notes, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes

<<<

 are in global form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.
While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under

<<<

 the Notes by making payments to a common depositary. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has

<<<

 no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in such a Global Note.
Meetings o fHolders and modification
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling

<<<

 meetings of Holders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Holders including Holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Holders who voted in a manner

<<<

 contrary to the majority.
In addition, the Issuer may, subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), make any modification to the Notes, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the Agency Agreement and/or the Deed of Covenant which

<<<

 is not prejudicial to the interests of the Holders without the consent of the Holders. Any such modification shall be binding on the Holders.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks and may be lowered, suspended, withdrawn or not maintained

<<<


Each of S&P and Fitch is expected to assign a credit rating to the Notes. In addition, each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch has assigned credit ratings to the Issuer as described in "Overview of the Notes" above. These ratings may not reflect the

<<<

 potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes or the standing of the Issuer.
A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities

<<<

 and any rating agency may revise, suspend or withdraw at any time the relevant rating assigned by it if, in the sole judgement of the relevant rating agency, among other things, the credit quality of the Notes or, as the case may be, the Issuer

<<<

 has declined or is in question. In addition, there is no guarantee that any rating of the Notes and/or the Issuer will be maintained by the Issuer following the date of this Prospectus. If any rating assigned to the Notes and/or the Issuer

Change o f law
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes will be governed by the laws of England, except for Condition 4 (Status o f the Notes), Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), Condition

<<<

 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement o f the Notes), Condition 8.2 (Early redemption upon the occurrence o f a Special Event), and Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) which shall be governed by, and construed in accordance

<<<

 with, Danish law. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of England or Denmark or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act

<<<

 withholding may affectpayments on the Notes
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") impose a new reporting regime and, potentially, a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to (i) certain payments from

<<<

 sources within the United States, (ii) "foreign pass thru payments" made to certain non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with this new reporting regime, and (iii) payments to certain investors that do not provide identification

<<<

 information with respect to interests issued by a participating non-U.S. financial institution. Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within the clearing systems, in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that FATCA

<<<

 will affect the amount of any payment received by the clearing systems. However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary

<<<

 generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate

<<<

 investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding

<<<

. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation

<<<

 or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has paid the clearing systems, and the Issuer has therefore no

<<<

 responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the clearing systems and custodians or intermediaries. Prospective investors should refer to the section "Taxation Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act."
Notes where denominations involve

<<<

 integral multiples: Definitive Notes
The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum denomination of EUR 100,000 plus one or more higher integral multiples of EUR 1,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not

<<<

 integral multiples of EUR 100,000. In such a case a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than EUR 100,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive

<<<

 Note in respect of such holding (should Definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of the Notes such that its holding amounts to a denomination.
If Definitive Notes are issued, Holders should be aware that Definitive

<<<

 Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of EUR 100,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Interests o f the Joint-Lead Managers
Certain of the Joint-Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the

<<<

 future, engage in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.

5.2 Accrual o f interest: Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption

<<<

) until whichever is the earlier of:

(i) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Holder; and

<<<

 as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Reference Rate Determination Date in relation to a Reset Interest Period, determine the Reference Rate for such Reset Interest Period and calculate the amount of interest payable

<<<

 per Calculation Amount on the Interest Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period (each a "Reset Interest Amount").
5.6 Publication o fReference Rate and Reset Interest Amount: With respect to each

<<<

 Reset Interest Period, the Fiscal Agent will cause the relevant Reference Rate and the relevant Reset Interest Amount determined by it, together with the relevant Interest Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset

<<<

 Interest Period, to be notified to the Paying Agents and each listing authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system (if any) by which the Notes have then been admitted to listing, trading and/or quotation as soon as practicable after such

<<<

 determination but in any event not later than the relevant Reset Date. Notice thereof shall also promptly be given to the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
5.7 Calculation o f amount o f interest per Calculation Amount: Save

<<<

 as specified in Condition 5.3 (Interest to (but excluding) the First Call Date), the amount of interest payable in respect of the Calculation Amount (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Reset Interest Amount) for any period shall be

<<<

 calculated by:
(i) applying the applicable Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount;
(ii) multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction; and
(iii) rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being rounded upwards

<<<

).
If pursuant to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement o f the Notes) or as otherwise required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer, the Outstanding Principal Amounts are

<<<

 reduced and/or reinstated during an Interest Period, the Calculation Amount will be adjusted by the Fiscal Agent to reflect such Outstanding Principal Amounts from time to time so that the relevant amount of interest is determined by reference

 to such Calculation Amount as adjusted from time to time, all as determined by the Fiscal Agent.

6.

Interest Cancellation

<<<



6.1 Interest Cancellation: Any payment of interest in respect of the Notes shall be payable only out of the Issuer's Distributable Items and:

(i) may be cancelled, at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer in its sole

<<<

 discretion; or

(ii) will be mandatorily cancelled to the extent so required by the Relevant Rules, including the applicable criteria for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments.

6.2 Notice o fInterest Cancellation: The Issuer shall give notice

<<<

 to the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of any such cancellation of a payment of interest, which notice might be given after the date on which the relevant payment of interest is scheduled to be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing

<<<

, failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the right of the Issuer not to pay interest as described above.

6.3 Effect o f Interest Cancellation: Following any cancellation of interest as described above, the right of Holders to receive

<<<

 accrued interest in respect of any such Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods

<<<

 are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned for any purpose nor will the non-payment of such interest constitute an Enforcement Event.

It is currently expected that discretionary payments in respect

<<<

 o f certain capital instruments (including payments o f interest on the Notes, which would include for the avoidance o f doubt, any additional amounts in respect o f interest which may be payable under Condition 10 (Taxation)) will be required

<<<

 to be cancelled, in whole or in part, to the extent that:

(i) Distributable Items are insufficient to make the relevantpayment(s);

(ii) the combined buffer requirement is not met and, if the relevant payment(s) were made, the amount o fsuch

<<<

 payment(s) would exceed the Maximum Distributable Amount; or

(iii) the Relevant Rules prescribe and/or, as the case may be, the Relevant Regulator requires that the relevantpayment(s) shall be cancelled.

For the purposes hereof, the "Cancellation

<<<

 o f Interest" section in "Risk Factors" above and the italicised text under Condition 7.2 (Reinstatement o f the Notes) below, "Maximum Distributable Amount" means any maximum distributable amount relating to the Issuer (as will be implemented

<<<

 in Danish law in relation to the provisions described under Article 141 o f the CRD IV Directive, as such provisions are amended or replacedfrom time to time).

Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes



<<<

7.1 Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event: If at any time a Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer shall immediately notify the Relevant Regulator and, in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices), the Holders and the Outstanding Principal Amounts

<<<

 shall be reduced as described below.

Such reduction shall take place on such date selected by the Issuer in consultation with the Relevant Regulator (the "Write Down Date") but no later than one month following the occurrence of the relevant

<<<

 Trigger Event unless, in accordance with the Relevant Rules, the Relevant Regulator has agreed with the

37

Issuer in writing that the Outstanding Principal Amounts may be reduced after a longer period, in which case, on such date as agreed

<<<

 with the Relevant Regulator.
The amount of the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts on the Write Down Date will be equal to the lower of:
(i) the amount of a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts that would restore the Common

<<<

 Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, to at least the Trigger Event Threshold at the point of such reduction, taking into account:
(A) first, the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (if any) of the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Group, as the case may be, generated on or prior to the Write Down Date by all Higher Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) outstanding at such time; and
(B) second, the pro-rata reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion

<<<

 into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of all Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) outstanding at such time with such proration based on the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (if any) of the

<<<

 Issuer and/or the Group, as the case may be, generated on or prior to the Write Down Date by all Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) outstanding at such time,
in each case, in accordance with the terms of the relevant instruments

<<<

 and the Relevant Rules and provided that each of provision (A) and/or (B) above shall be disapplied to the extent the existence of such provision(s) would cause the occurrence of a Capital Event
and
(ii) the amount of a reduction of the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amounts that would reduce the Outstanding Principal Amounts to EUR 0.01.
Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest will continue to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amounts following

<<<

 such reduction, and will be subject to Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 7.2 (Reinstatement o f the Notes) as described herein.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note shall, upon the reduction

<<<

 of the Outstanding Principal Amounts described above, be reduced on a likewise pro-rata basis.
Any reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) shall not constitute

<<<

 an Enforcement Event.
7.2 Reinstatement o f the Notes: Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts in accordance with Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event), the Issuer may, at its discretion, reinstate some

<<<

 or all of the principal amount of the Notes, subject to compliance with the Relevant Rules, on a pro-rata basis with all other Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) which would, following such reinstatement, constitute Additional

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital and feature similar write down and reinstatement provisions.
For the avoidance of doubt, at no time may the Outstanding Principal Amounts exceed the Original Principal Amount of the Notes.
To the extent that the principal amount

<<<

 of the Notes has been reinstated as described above, interest shall begin to accrue on the reinstated principal amount of the Notes, and become payable in accordance with these Conditions, as from the date of the relevant reinstatement.
38

<<<



It is currently expected that any reinstatement o f the principal amount o f an institution's Additional Tier 1 instruments (including, in the case o f the Issuer, the Notes) may not exceed the reinstatement limit applicable to that institution

<<<

, which is calculated as the lower of:

(i) the Maximum Distributable Amount; and

(ii) the amount equal to the Profits (as defined below) o f the institution multiplied by the ratio o f the original principal amount o f all outstanding Additional

<<<

 Tier 1 instruments o f the institution where the principal amount of such Additional Tier 1 instruments has been reduced, divided by the total Tier 1 capital of the institution at the date of the relevant reinstatement.

For the purposes hereof

<<<

, "Profits" means the profits o f the institution after the institution has taken a formal decision confirming thefinal profits of the institution.

41

obligations under the Notes and such payment obligations are not met within seven Business Days after the Issuer has received notice thereof, any Holder may, at its own

<<<

 discretion and without further notice, institute proceedings in Denmark in order to recover the amounts due from the Issuer to such Holder, provided that a Holder may not at any time file for liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. Any Holder

<<<

 may, at its discretion and without further notice, institute such proceedings against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce any obligation, condition or provision binding on the Issuer under the Notes, provided that the Issuer shall not

<<<

 by virtue of the institution of any proceedings be obliged to pay any sum or sums sooner than the same would otherwise have been payable by it; and
(ii) if an order is made or an effective resolution is passed for the liquidation or bankruptcy

<<<

Any such modification shall be binding on the

<<<

 Holders and the Couponholders and any such modification shall be notified to the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) as soon as practicable thereafter.

16. Notices
Notices to Holders will be deemed to be validly given if

<<<

<<<

 (so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange so permit), if published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).
The Issuer shall also ensure that notices are

<<<

 duly published in a manner which complies with the rules of any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are for the time being listed or by which they have been admitted to trading.
Any notice so given will be deemed to

<<<

 have been validly given on the date of first such publication (or, if required to be published in more than one newspaper, on the first date on which publication shall have been made in all the required newspapers). Couponholders will be deemed

<<<

 for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the Holders in accordance with this Condition.
Notwithstanding Condition 16 (Notices), while all the Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such Global Note

<<<

(s) are held in their entirety on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system, the requirement for a notice to be published in a leading English language daily newspaper having general circulation

<<<

<<<

<<<

17. Currency Indemnity
The currency in which the Notes are denominated is euro (the "Contractual Currency"), which is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer in

<<<

 respect of the Notes, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Contractual Currency (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, ajudgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction or otherwise) by

<<<

 any Holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer shall only constitute a discharge to the Issuer to the extent of the amount of the Contractual Currency which such Holder is able to purchase with the amount so received

<<<

 or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If that amount is less than the amount of

<<<

 the Contractual Currency expressed to be due to any Holder in respect of such Note or Coupon the Issuer shall indemnify such Holder against any loss sustained by such Holder as a result. In any event, the Issuer shall indemnify each such Holder

<<<

 against any cost of making such purchase which is reasonably incurred. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's other obligations, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall

<<<

 apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder and shall continue in full force and effect despite any judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due in respect of the Notes or any judgment or

<<<

 order. Any such loss as aforesaid shall be deemed to constitute a loss suffered by the relevant Holder and no proof or evidence of any actual loss will be required by the Issuer.
18. Waiver and Remedies
No failure to exercise, and no delay

<<<

 in exercising, on the part of the Holder, any right in these Conditions shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. Rights

<<<

 hereunder shall be in addition to all other rights provided by law. No notice or demand given in any case shall constitute a waiver of rights to take other action in the same, similar or other instances without such notice or demand.

 Report 2013, pg. 159.

The Group has two channels through which it grants mortgage loans: (i) Realkredit Danmark A/S; and (ii) the Issuer itself including bank subsidiaries.

The mortgage loans on the Realkredit Danmark A/S platform are funded

<<<

 through the issuance of mortgage bonds according to the Danish Mortgage-Credit Loans and Mortgage-Credit Bonds, etc. Act and executive orders issued by the DFSA.

Realkredit Danmark A/S currently issues mortgage covered bonds only through the

 Capital Centres of Realkredit Danmark A/S.

Shareholders' equity

The Issuer's shareholders' equity was DKK 146 billion (EUR 19.5 billion) as at the end of 2013 against DKK 138 billion (EUR 18.5 billion) at the end of 2012.3

At year-end 2

<<<

013, the Issuer's authorised and issued share capital totalled DKK 10,086,200,000 (EUR 1,352 million) based on 1,008,620,000 shares of DKK 10 (EUR 1.34) each. The Issuer's shares are listed on the NASDAQ OMX, Copenhagen.

At year-end 2013, the

<<<

 Issuer had approximately 303,000 shareholders. According to the Danish Companies Act, shareholders must notify a company if their shareholding exceeds 5 per cent. of the company's share capital or higher percentages divisible by 5. Two shareholder

<<<

 groups have notified the Issuer that they hold or represent more than 5 per cent. of its share capital at the end of 2013:



A.P. Mller and Chastine Mc-Kinney Mller Foundation, Copenhagen, held a total of (directly

and indirectly) 22.

Capital and Solvency
Pursuant to the Danish

<<<

 Act No. 67 of 3 February 2009 on State Capital Injections in Credit Institutions etc., as amended by the Consolidated Act. No. 876 of 15 September 2009, Act No. 516 of 12 June 2009, Act No. 1273 of 16 December 2009 and Act No. 556 of 21 December

<<<

 2010, (the "Credit Act"), a scheme was set up whereby the Danish State offered to inject state funded tier 1 hybrid capital and/or to underwrite issues of tier 1 hybrid capital for Danish banks and mortgage credit institutions. The capital

<<<

 injections were in the form of tier 1 hybrid capital without a set maturity and a possibility for redemption after three years. Redemption is to be subject to approval from the DFSA.
At the general meeting of the Issuer held on 4 March 200

<<<

9, the shareholders authorised the Board of Directors to apply for and implement a tier 1 hybrid capital injection from the Danish State. In May 2009, the Issuer and Realkredit Danmark A/S received subordinated loan capital from the Danish State

<<<

 in the form of hybrid core capital of approximately DKK 24 billion (EUR 3,224 million)4 and approximately DKK 2 billion (EUR 269 million)5, respectively. The subordinated loans strengthened the capital base, and the Group was better prepared

<<<

 to withstand losses that any further negative economic developments may cause. In May 2012, the subordinated loan capital of approximately DKK 2 billion (EUR 269 million) for Realkredit Danmark A/S was repaid. In contrast to the three-year

<<<

 redemption limitation described above, the Issuer's hybrid capital from the Danish State can only be redeemed at the earliest on 11 April 2014 and the Issuer plans to redeem it in 2014. The following table below shows the total capital ratio

<<<

, tier 1 capital ratio and core tier 1 capital ratio excluding hybrid capital. The second table shows the risk-weighted assets, subordinated debt and hybrid capital. The interest rate (defined as "annual yield") on the loans from the Danish

<<<

 State is 9.265 per cent. per annum, with an annual premium of 0.5 of a percentage point per annum for the conversion option. The interest rate will increase if the Issuer pays dividends in excess of DKK 5.5 billion (EUR 0.74 billion) per annum

<<<

.
Pursuant to the agreement on state-funded capital injection between the Issuer and the Danish State, dated 5 May 2009 (the "State-funded Hybrid Agreement"), the Issuer is subject to, amongst other things, restrictions on capital reductions

<<<

, share repurchases and the terms of new and existing share issues, restrictions on the distribution of dividends, restrictions on the use of funds to capitalise businesses in violation of the Credit Act and certain conditions concerning executive

<<<

 pay and bonuses. The State-funded Hybrid Agreement is annexed to the Articles of Association which are available for inspection at the places specified in "General Information".

The Group's capital base consists of tier 1 capital (core tier 1 capital and hybrid capital after deductions) and tier 2 capital.

<<<

 At 31 December 2013, the capital base of the Group amounted to DKK 182 billion (EUR 24.4 billion)6. At 31 December 2013, the total capital ratio for the Group was 21.4 per cent., with a core tier 1 capital ratio of 14.7 per cent. and a tier

<<<

 1 capital ratio of 19.0 per cent. At 31 December 2013, the total capital ratio for the Issuer was 27.2 per cent. with a core tier 1 capital ratio of 18.9 per cent. and a tier 1 capital ratio of 24.3 per cent.

At the end of 2013, the Group

<<<

's RWA amounted to DKK 852 billion (EUR 114.2 billion), against DKK 819.0 billion (EUR 109.8 billion)7 at the end of 2012. The increase in RWA of DKK 33 billion (EUR 4.4 billion) from the level in 2012 was caused mainly by the measures taken

<<<

 to comply with the first of four DFSA orders. The measures involved increasing the risk weights for the Group's corporate portfolio. The remaining DFSA orders were provisionally addressed through the solvency need, with temporary Pillar II

<<<

 add-ons totalling DKK 4 billion (EUR 0.54 billion). The add-ons will be removed in 2014 when the Group is ready to implement the changes required to comply with the remaining orders. In addition, the Group carried out a number of initiatives

<<<

 to strengthen the internal ratings based approach framework and improve capital efficiency.

Danske Bank will be subject to the new CRR from 1 January 2014. The CRR introduces certain changes to the current calculation of the capital base.

<<<

 The rules will be phased in during the years until 2018 for capital deductions and until 2021 grandfathered for capital instruments. Assuming fully phased-in CRR rules in 2018, the Group's core tier 1 capital ratio as stated in the Annual Report

<<<

 2013 would be reduced by 1.9 percentage points. The decline in the core tier 1 capital ratio is caused primarily by deductions for insurance subsidiaries, which now must be made from core tier 1 capital instead of half from tier 1 capital and

<<<

 half from the capital base, respectively. A deduction for defined benefit pension fund assets is also introduced. The changes will be phased in at 20 per cent. as at 1 January 2014. The CRR also introduces new prudential filters for deduction

<<<

 from core tier 1 capital. The filters include additional value adjustments of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The EBA has not yet published its final standards for these value adjustments, and the standards may lead to further

<<<

 reduction of the Group's core tier 1 capital. Changes to RWA introduced by the CRR were implemented in full as at 1 January 2014 (estimated DKK 46 billion (EUR 6.2 billion)8). The increase is caused mainly by the introduction of the credit

<<<

 valuation adjustment capital charge and tighter requirements for credit risk. For further information see note 28 in Annual Report 2013.

The Group's strong financial position was confirmed by the EBA's capitalisation test of European banks

<<<

, which was published in December 2011 and again in a final report in October 2012. This test was conducted to assess

FX rate at 31 December 2013 = 7.4603 DKK per EUR. FX rate at 31 December 2012 = 7.4604 DKK per EUR. FX rate at 31 December

<<<

 2013 = 7.4603 DKK per EUR.
53

European banks' need for recapitalisation. As expected, the Group passed the test with a capital level substantially above the EBA's requirement.
Restrictions on Distributions
As a result of the Issuer's participation

<<<

 in the Danish bank packages, the Issuer could not distribute dividends for the financial years ended 31 December 2008 and 2009. Since 1 October 2010, and for as long as the Danish State holds hybrid capital in the Issuer, the Issuer may distribute

<<<

 dividends only if the dividends can be paid in full out of the net profit. The loan agreement with the Danish State also stipulates an increase in the interest rate if annual dividend payments exceed DKK 5.5 billion (EUR 0.74 billion).
The

<<<

 Issuer aims to pay dividends of about 40 per cent. of its net profit as soon as it is prudent. Until all capital and rating targets are met, the pay-out ratio may be lower. For 2013, the Board o f Directors is proposing a dividend of DKK 2

<<<

 (EUR 0.27) per share, or 28 per cent. of net profit for the year.
Risk Management
Introduction
The Issuer's Rules of Procedure for the Board of Directors and the Executive Board (the "Rules of Procedure") specify the responsibilities of the

<<<

 two boards and the division of responsibilities between them. The Rules o f Procedure and the two-tier management structure, which were developed in accordance with Danish legislation, are central to the organisation of risk management and

<<<

 the policy on lending authority limits in the Group.
The Board of Directors lays down overall policies, while the Executive Board is in charge of the Group's day-to-day management. The risk and capital management functions are separate from

<<<

 the credit assessment and credit-granting functions.
Responsibility for the day-to-day management o f risks in the Group is divided between Group Finance & Legal, Group Risk Management and the business units. The Group has established a segregation

<<<

 of duties between units that enter into business transactions with customers or otherwise expose the Group to risk on the one hand, and units in charge o f overall risk management on the other.
Group Risk Management
Group Risk Management is

<<<

 headed by the Group's chief risk officer ("CRO"), who is a member of the Executive Board.
The department has overall responsibility for monitoring the Group's risk policies and for monitoring, following up and reporting on risk issues across

<<<

 risk types and organisational units. Group Risk Management also serves as a resource for referrals from local risk committees.
The department supports and challenges the rest o f the risk management organisation in risk management practices

<<<

 and reporting. It serves as secretariat for the All Risk Committee. Senior staff from the department also chair the Risk Model and Parameter Committee, which monitors the Group's use of risk models, results of backtests and changes to parameters

<<<

; the Operational Risk Committee, which evaluates the management of the Group's key operational risks; and the Product Risk Committee, which reviews risk related to possible new products. A specialised department in Group Risk Management is

<<<

 responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of operational risks.
In addition, the department has overall responsibility for setting the group-wide risk appetite and policies, for reviewing the approval and follow-up processes in the business

<<<

 units' lending books, and for monitoring and reporting on the Group's consolidated lending portfolio - including the determination of portfolio limits for specific industries and countries.
54

Group Risk Management is also responsible for

<<<

 facilitating the quarterly process of calculating and consolidating the impairment of credit exposures.
A unit within the department is responsible for developing credit rating and valuation models and for ensuring that they are available for

<<<

 day-to-day credit processing at the business units and that they meet statutory requirements. A separate unit is responsible for backtesting and validating credit risk parameters in collaboration with the business units.
Group Finance & Legal

<<<


Group Finance & Legal is headed by the Group's chief financial officer ("CFO"), who is a member of the Executive Board. The department is responsible for the Group's financial reporting, budgeting and strategic business analysis, including

<<<

 the tools used by the business units for performance follow-up and analysis.
The department is also in charge of the Group's investor relations, capital structure, capital allocation, regulatory matters and relations with international rating

<<<

 agencies.
It is also responsible for the Group's solvency, RWA, leverage ratio and capital allocation and the Group's internal capital adequacy assessment process ("ICAAP").
Within Group Finance & Legal, Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring

<<<

 liquidity risk and funding needs. Group Treasury also ensures that the Group's structural liquidity profile enables the Group to comply with the limits and meet the targets set by the Board of Directors and the All Risk Committee as well as

<<<

 regulatory and prudential requirements.
Furthermore, Group Treasury is responsible for asset liability management, private equity activities and long-term funding activities.
Business units
The business units' mandate to originate and accumulate

<<<

 risk exposure for the Group in their daily work is regulated by risk policies, instructions and limits. The Group strives to cultivate a corporate culture that supports and enforces the organisation's objective to undertake selected risks according

<<<

 to guidelines that have been agreed upon.
Responsibility for all business-related risks is with the heads of the business units and the heads of the operations and services areas. Their responsibilities extend across national borders, thus

<<<

 risk management is centralised by business segment. The segment-based organisation enables risk management processes to be tailored to the various customer segments and to be aligned across borders. Lending authorities for specific customer

<<<

 segments and products are granted to the individual business units. Credit decisions exceeding the delegated authorities are referred to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors as required.
The business units carry out all the fundamental

<<<

 tasks required for sound risk management and controls. These tasks include updating the information about customers that is used in risk management tools and models as well as maintaining and following up on customer relationships.
Each business

<<<

 unit is responsible for preparing documentation before undertaking business transactions and for recording the transactions properly. Each unit is also required to update information on customer relationships and other issues as necessary.

<<<


The business units must also ensure that all risk exposures comply with specific risk limits as well as the Group's other guidelines.
Certain risk areas, such as market risk and liquidity risk, are still managed centrally at the group level

<<<

.
55

Increased attention from local regulators - especially where activities are organised in local legal entities led the Group to strengthen governance structures for risk management from a local perspective. In the new organisation, country

<<<

 managers and local risk officers are responsible for ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations. Local risk committees as well as asset and liability management committees have also been set up where they are relevant.
Legal Proceedings

<<<


Owing to its business volume, the Group is continually a party to various lawsuits and disputes and has an ongoing dialogue with public authorities such as the DFSA. In view of its size, the Group does not expect the outcome of pending lawsuits

<<<

 and disputes or its dialogue with public authorities to have any material effect on its financial position.
Bank Packages
With effect from 1 October 2010 the Act on Financial Stability (Chapter 4a of the Danish Act No. 1003 of 10 October 2

<<<

008 on Financial Stability, as amended by Consolidated Act No. 875 of 15 September 2009, Act No. 516 of 12 June 2009, Act No. 1273 of 16 December 2009, Act No. 721 of 25 June 2010, Act No. 1556 of 21 December 2010 and Act No. 619 of 14 June

<<<

 2011, Act No. 273 of 27 March 2012, Act No. 1231 of 18 December 2012 and Act No. 1287 of 19 December 2012, and as further amended from time to time (the "Act on Financial Stability")) was amended inter alia to allow for a controlled winding

<<<

-up of a distressed bank through the Financial Stability Company which is known as "Bank Package III". The resolution scheme is voluntary and contains no general state guarantee of creditors. With respect to SIFIs, please see "European implementation

<<<

 of the Basel III Framework" below.
The intention of the winding-up procedures is to wind up a distressed bank faster than under the traditional bankruptcy procedures. The procedures do not alter the risk for the creditors, which is that under

<<<

 both the winding-up procedures and the traditional bankruptcy procedures, the creditors may lose all or part of their claims.
The Act on Financial Stability was further amended with effect from 23 June 2011 in order to allow for the Guarantee

<<<

 Fund for Depositors and Investors to contribute with a financial inducement to encourage a sound bank to take over all activities of a distressed bank, including all unsubordinated and unsecured claims. On 25 August 2011 a number of consolidation

<<<

 initiatives was agreed upon by the vast majority of the political parties in the Danish Parliament ("Bank Package IV"). Bank Package IV provides for a strengthening of the compensation scheme in order to create greater incentives for sound

<<<

 banks to wholly or partly take over a bank in distress. In particular, Bank Package IV provides for the Danish State to contribute in the compensation scheme with an amount up to the equivalent of the haircut that would have been imposed on

<<<

 any state guaranteed bonds that were issued by the bank in distress. Contrary to Bank Package III, the unsubordinated and unsecured senior creditors will not suffer any loss if Bank Package IV is applied.
New Capital and Liquidity Regulations

<<<


New regulations for the financial sector are being proposed in the EU and beyond. The Group follows this process closely and supports measures that strengthen the resilience of the sector and its ability to support economic growth. The Group

<<<

 is of the opinion that the Basel III guidelines generally meet this criterion.
European implementation of the Basel III Framework
The final versions of the CRR and the CRD IV Directive (for the purposes of this "Description of the Danske Bank

<<<

 Group" section, in each case as defined in the risk factor on page 11 of this Prospectus headed "The Issuer will face increased capital and liquidity requirements as a result of the new Basel III Framework") were adopted in June 2013. The CRR

<<<

 entered into force on 1 January 2014 and the CRD IV Directive is anticipated to be implemented in Denmark in 2014. The framework implements among other things the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposals imposing stricter capital

<<<

 and liquidity requirements upon banks ("Basel III") in
56

the EU. The CRR covers a wide range of prudent requirements for banks across EU member states, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, RWA, leverage

<<<

 ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements. The CRD IV Directive covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual risk assessment) and other measures such as the combined capital buffer

<<<

 requirements, SIFI definition (as defined below), governance and remuneration requirements.
The CRD IV Directive will come into force through implementation in the Danish Financial Business Act, whereas the CRR applies immediately without implementation

<<<

 in national law. The phase-in of the capital requirements will follow the path in the CRR until 2018 unless required earlier in applicable Danish legislation. The EBA will propose detailed rules through binding technical standards during the

<<<

 period 2014 to 2016 for many areas including, inter alia, liquidity requirements and certain aspects of capital requirements.
Under the CRR and the CRD IV Directive, the capital requirement for common equity tier 1 ("CET1") (which does not

<<<

 include hybrid capital) will be phased in gradually from the current 2 per cent. RWA to up to 9.5 per cent. in 2019. The 9.5 per cent. requirement will include a "capital conservation buffer requirement" of 2.5 per cent. and a "countercyclical

<<<

 buffer requirement" of 0-2.5 per cent. in addition to the minimum requirement of 4.5 per cent. The countercyclical buffer requirement will apply in periods of excess lending growth in the economy and can vary for each jurisdiction. If a bank

<<<

 does not maintain these buffers (in excess of the 4.5 per cent. CET1 minimum requirement), restrictions will be placed on its ability to pay dividends and make other payments.
For each SIFI there will be additional capital requirements beyond

<<<

 the minimum requirements. In October 2013 a political agreement on SIFI requirements was reached in Denmark. In the agreement, which is expected to be implemented into Danish law in 2014, the Issuer has been designated as a SIFI. According

<<<

 to the agreement, this will require the Issuer to comply with an additional CET1 capital requirement of 3 per cent. The intention is for the capital requirements imposed on Danish SIFIs to be on a par with the requirements set in other comparable

<<<

 European countries. Accordingly the final level of the Danish SIFI capital requirements will be assessed no later than 2017 after evaluating these other countries' final requirements. Regulations for the crisis management of Danish SIFIs and

<<<

 other banks and mortgage-credit institutions will not be established until forthcoming common EU crisis management regulations have been agreed upon, in particular the RRD and SRM proposals, including whether there should be additional requirements

<<<

 for Danish banks to issue debt that can be bailed-in. The agreement specifically states that it is not the intention that Danish SIFIs shall be resolved pursuant to Bank Package III. A position on the LCR requirement for Danish SIFIs awaits

<<<

 the European Commission's decision in 2014 on the final definition of the LCR requirement, including clarification of which assets can be used in complying with the LCR requirement, in particular whether Danish covered bonds can be used. All

<<<

 SIFIs must comply with the LCR requirement by 2015. The framework also contains stricter requirements for the quality of capital that may count as CET1 capital and for the calculation of RWA. The Group estimates that the effect of the CRR and

<<<

 the CRD IV Directive on its core equity tier 1 capital ratio at 1 January 2014 will be a reduction of about 1.9 percentage points when the rules are fully phased in in 2018. The reduction entails changes in various elements.
As regards liquidity

<<<

, the Basel Committee proposed two liquidity ratios in December 2012: (i) the LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"). The LCR stipulates that banks must have a liquidity buffer that ensures a survival horizon of at least 30 calendar days

<<<

 in the case of a seriously stressed liquidity situation. The NSFR is intended to ensure a sound funding structure by promoting an increase in long-dated funding. The NSFR stipulates that at all times banks must have stable funding equal to

<<<

 the amount of their illiquid assets for one year ahead.
In January 2013, the Basel Committee issued revisions to its guideline for the LCR. The revisions include a phasing-in of the minimum requirement in which it will be set at 60 per cent

<<<

. in 2015 and rise in equal annual steps to 100 per cent. on 1 January 2019. The revisions also include an expansion of the pool of level 2 liquid assets that can be counted in the liquidity buffer and a reduction of the weights assigned to

<<<

 certain liquidity outflows.
In Europe, the focus is on the LCR, but the definition of the LCR is still awaiting additional technical guidance from the EBA in 2014. Nevertheless, it is of great significance in the measurement of the Group's

<<<

 liquidity buffer with the LCR that the CRD IV Directive proposal enables most of the Group's holdings of
57

covered bonds, including Danish mortgage bonds, to be classified as level 1 liquid assets, on par with Danish government bonds, for

<<<

 example.
With an LCR of 127 per cent. at the end of 2013, the Group complied with the LCR requirement as defined by the DFSA. The Group also complied with all other liquidity requirements. Stress tests show that the Group has sufficient liquidity

<<<

 buffer for more than the coming 12 months.
Solvency II (insurance)
Once the new international insurance solvency rules, Solvency II, take effect, not expected before 2016, the requirements for capital strength in the insurance area will be

<<<

 the focus of attention. The rules are intended to protect customers' funds and will generally increase the capital requirements. Danica Pension is well-prepared for the new rules. Danica Pension is closely monitoring the work on the coming

<<<

 EU solvency rules, Solvency II which, among other things, are set to change the existing volume-based capital requirement to a capital requirement that more accurately reflects the risks involved in the operation.
Solvency II was previously

<<<

 set to take effect at 1 January 2014, but is now expected to take effect at 1 January 2016. The postponement is due to the many remaining unresolved issues that are holding up the legislative process. A central unresolved issue is the treatment

<<<

 of long-term guarantees. Despite the lingering uncertainty as to the effective date of Solvency II, Danica Pension has already begun to prepare for the transition to Solvency II.
Recent Developments
In connection with an internal investigation

<<<

, Danske Bank found that the Group's internal rules had been violated in relation to two bond transactions between Danske Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Realkredit Danmark, in the corporate mortgage bond market back in 2009. Danske Bank

<<<

 informed the DFSA of the matter, and the DFSA handed the matter over to the Danish Public Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime ("SIK"). As a result, on 7 February 2014 SIK brought accusations of price manipulation against

<<<

 Danske Bank, Realkredit Danmark and six employees.

TAXATION
The following is a general description of relevant tax considerations and is not to be regarded as a complete tax

<<<

 analysis of all tax issues related to the Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes should consult their professional tax advisers if they are in doubt about their own tax position.
Denmark Taxation
According to the Danish tax laws in effect

<<<

 as of the date of this Prospectus, (i) except as provided below, payments of interest or principal amounts to any holder of a Note are not subject to taxation in Denmark, (ii) no withholding tax should be required on such payments and (iii

<<<

) any gain realised upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note will not be subject to taxation in Denmark. This tax treatment applies solely to holders of the Notes who are not subject to full tax liability in Denmark or included in a Danish

<<<

 joint taxation scheme or do not carry on business in Denmark through a permanent establishment.
The Issuer understands that the enactment of the law referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of "Tax Event" in Condition 2 (Interpretation

<<<

) will have no adverse impact on the holders of the Notes.
EU Savings Directive
Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details

<<<

 of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in that other Member State or to certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State. However, for a transitional

<<<

 period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of

<<<

 certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
The

<<<

 European Commission has proposed certain amendments to the Directive, which may, if implemented, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above.
In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the

<<<

 withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favour of automatic information exchange under the Directive.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Sections 1471 through 1474 of FATCA impose a new reporting regime and potentially a 30 per

<<<

 cent. withholding tax with respect to certain payments to (i) any non-U.S. financial institution (a "foreign financial institution", or "FFI" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a "Participating FFI" by entering into an agreement with

<<<

 the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to provide the IRS with certain information in respect of its account holders and investors or is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA and (ii) any investor (unless otherwise

<<<

 exempt from FATCA) that does not provide information sufficient to determine whether the investor is a U.S. person or should otherwise be treated as holding a "United States Account" of the Issuer (a "Recalcitrant Holder"). The Issuer will

<<<

 be classified as an FFI.
The new withholding regime will be phased in beginning 1 July 2014 for payments from sources within the United States and will apply to "foreign passthru payments" (a term not yet defined) no earlier than 1 January

<<<

 2017. This withholding would potentially apply to payments in respect of (i) any Notes characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterized as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or after

<<<

 the "grandfathering date", which is the later of (a) 1 July 2014 and (b) the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are filed with the Federal Register, or

<<<

 which are materially modified on or after the grandfathering date and (ii) any Notes characterised as equity or which do not have a fixed term for U.S. federal tax purposes, whenever issued. If Notes are issued before the grandfathering date

<<<

, and additional Notes of the same series are issued on or after that
68

date, the additional Notes may not be treated as grandfathered, which may have negative consequences for the existing Notes, including a negative impact on market price

<<<

.
The United States and a number of other jurisdictions have announced their intention to negotiate intergovernmental agreements to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (each, an "IGA"). Pursuant to FATCA and the "Model 1" and "Model 2" IGAs

<<<

 released by the United States, an FFI in an IGA signatory country could be treated as a "Reporting FI" not subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives. Further, an FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction generally would not be

<<<

 required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) (any such withholding being "FATCA Withholding") from payments it makes. The Model 2 IGA leaves open the possibility that a Reporting FI might in the future be required

<<<

 to withhold as a Participating FFI on foreign passthru payments and payments that it makes to Recalcitrant Holders. Under each Model IGA, a Reporting FI would still be required to report certain information in respect of its account holders

<<<

 and investors to its home government or to the IRS. The United States and Denmark have signed an agreement (the "United States-Denmark IGA") based largely on the Model 1 IGA.
The Issuer expects to be treated as a Reporting FI pursuant to the

<<<

 United States-Denmark IGA and does not anticipate being obliged to deduct any FATCA Withholding on payments it makes. There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will be treated as a Reporting FI, or that it would in the future not

<<<

 be required to deduct FATCA Withholding from payments it makes. Accordingly, the Issuer and financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made may be required to withhold FATCA Withholding if (i) any FFI through or to which

<<<

 payment on such Notes is made is not a Participating FFI, a Reporting FI, or otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA or (ii) an investor is a Recalcitrant Holder.
Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within the clearing

<<<

 systems, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Notes by the Issuer, any Paying Agent and the common depositary given that each of the entities in the payment chain beginning with

<<<

 the Issuer and ending with the clearing systems is a major financial institution whose business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Notes. The documentation

<<<

 expressly contemplates the possibility that the Notes may go into definitive form and therefore that they may be taken out of the clearing systems. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding

<<<

. However, Definitive Notes will only be printed in remote circumstances.
FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all

<<<

 of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to payments they may receive in connection with the

<<<

 Notes.
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH IRS CIRCULAR 230, EACH TAXPAYER IS HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY TAX DISCUSSION HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY THE TAXPAYER FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME

<<<

 TAX PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE TAXPAYER; (B) ANY SUCH TAX DISCUSSION WAS WRITTEN TO SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) THE TAXPAYER SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THE TAXPAYER

<<<

'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISER.
The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT")
The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France

<<<

, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States").
The proposed FTT has very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions

<<<

) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt.
69

Under current proposals the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally

<<<

, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a

<<<

 participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating

<<<

 Member State.
The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and is the subject of legal challenge. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional

<<<

 EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders o f Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

 of

the Internal Revenue Code."

The sections referred to in such legend provide that a United States person who holds a Note or Coupon generally will not be allowed to deduct any loss realised on the sale, exchange or redemption of such Note

<<<

 or Coupon and any gain (which might otherwise be characterised as capital gain) recognised on such sale, exchange or redemption will be treated as ordinary income.

5.

(i) There has been no significant change in the financial position of the

<<<

 Issuer or of the Issuer and its

Subsidiaries taken as a whole since 31 December 2013, the last day of the financial period in

respect of which the most recent financial statements of the Issuer have been prepared; and

(ii) there has been

<<<

 no material adverse change in the prospects of the Issuer since 31 December 2013, the last day of the financial period in respect of which the most recently audited financial statements of the Issuer have been prepared.

6.

There are no governmental

<<<

, legal or arbitration proceedings against or affecting the Issuer or any of its

Subsidiaries (and no such proceedings are pending or threatened of which the Issuer is aware) during a

period covering at least the previous twelve months which

<<<

 have or may have in the recent past,

individually or in the aggregate, significant effects on the profitability or the financial position of the

Issuer or of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

7.

The annual financial statements

<<<

 of the Issuer for the financial years ended 31 December 2013 and 31

December 2012 have, in each case, been audited by KPMG Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab

 the relevant

independent public auditors of the Issuer for such period. Unqualified opinions have been reported on

such financial statements and KPMG is a member of "FSR - Danske Revisorer" (Association of State

Authorised Public Accountants

<<<

).

8.

The Irish Listing Agent is Arthur Cox Listing Services Limited and the address of its registered office is

Arthur Cox Building, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, Ireland. Arthur Cox Listing Services Limited is acting

solely in its capacity

<<<

 as listing agent for the Issuer in connection with the Notes and is not itself seeking

admission of the Notes to trading on the regulated market of the Irish Stock Exchange.

9.

For the period of 12 months following the date of this Prospectus

<<<

, hard copies of the following documents

will be available, upon request, free of charge, from the registered office of the Issuer and from the

71

Specified Offices of the Paying Agent for the time being in London (where applicable, with

<<<

 an English translation thereof):
(i) the Articles of Association of the Issuer;
(ii) the Agency Agreement; and
(iii) the Deed of Covenant.
10. For a period of 12 months following the date of this Prospectus, electronic copies of the following

<<<

 documents will be available on the website of the Central Bank at www.centralbank.ie/resulation/securities-markets/prospectus/Pases/approvedprospectus.aspx:
(i) a copy of this Prospectus; and
(ii) any supplements to this Prospectus.
11. For

<<<

 a period of 12 months following the date of this Prospectus, electronic copies of the Annual Reports (as defined in "Documents Incorporated by Reference") will be available on the website of the Issuer at www.danskebank.com (see "Documents

<<<

 Incorporated by Reference" for more details).
12. Certain of the Joint-Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services

<<<

 for, the Issuer and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Joint-Lead Managers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively

<<<

 trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities

<<<

 and/or instruments of the Issuer or Issuer's affiliates. Certain of the Joint-Lead Managers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary

<<<

 risk management policies. Typically, such Joint-Lead Managers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities

<<<

, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Joint-Lead Managers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent

<<<

 research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
11. The indication of the yield of the Notes is 

<<<

5.831 per cent. per annum and is calculated as at the date of this Prospectus on the basis of the Issue Price. It is not an indication of future yield.
12. The language of this Prospectus is English. Certain legislative references and technical

<<<

 terms have been cited in their original language in order that the correct technical meaning may be ascribed to them under applicable law.
