4.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

4.1 The Issuer's evaluation

<<<



The Issuer is of the opinion that the Proposal is in the best interest o f the Bondholders. Pursuant to the terms of the Bond Agreement, no security is established directly over the Preferred Senior Debt Borrowers; i.e. no security interest

<<<

 is established directly over Interoil Colombia. This entails that both secured and unsecured debt incurred by Interoil Colombia ranks ahead of the Bondholders. Thus, the proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement, which does not increase the

<<<

 aggregated amount of debt incurred by Interoil Colombia, will not affect the current position of the Bondholders.

However, such amendment will work in favour of the Bondholders, as a secured loan will have a lower interest and risk compared

<<<

 to secured debt. The current unsecured debt in Colombia is short-term loans that are continuously rolled. If the market deteriorates, such refinancing o f the unsecured debt will be challenging.

Bondholders may for further information also

<<<

 contact Erik Sandøy (tel.: +47 67518654).

4.2 The Bond Trustee's evaluation

The Proposal described herein is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently

<<<

 evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable and vote accordingly.

5.

Attached hereto is a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the
