 Bond Issue 2007/2011 with ISIN NO 001 035418.6 (NOK Tranche) and NO 001 035420.2 (USD Tranche)
Oslo, 18 July 2011
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Approval of Intercreditor Deed and amendment of Loan Agreement
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond

<<<

 Trustee") is appointed as trustee for the above mentioned Bond Issues with ISIN N 0001035418.6 (the "NOK Tranche") and ISIN N 0001035420.2 (the "USD Tranche", and together with the NOK Tranche the "Loan") where Primorsk International Shipping

<<<

 Limited is the Borrower (the "Borrower" or the "Company").
All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the agreement for the Loan dated 23 February 2007 (the "Loan Agreement

<<<

") as amended by the amendment agreement dated 28 February 2011 (the "Amendment Agreement").
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all

<<<

 liability whatsoever related to such information.
The Borrower has engaged ABG Sundal Collier Norge ASA ("ABGSC") as its financial advisor with respect to the Proposal. Bondholders may contact Nicolay Friis (tel.: +47 2201 6145 or e-mail: nicolav

<<<

.fri is@abusc.noI for further information. ABGSC acts solely for the Borrower and no one else in connection with the Extended Deadline Proposal (as defined below). No due diligence investigations have been carried out by ABGSC with respect to

<<<

 the Borrower, and ABGSC expressly disclaim any and all liabilities whatsoever in connection with the Proposal.
1. Intercreditor Deed Reference is made to the Amendment Agreement based on the resolution adopted by the Bondholders' meeting on

<<<

 18 February 2011 (the "First Bondholders' M eeting"), where 100% of the voting Bondholders voted in favor. The Amendment Agreement became effective as o f 28 February 2011, but was however subject to certain conditions being fulfilled prior

<<<

 to 28 May 2011 (the "Deadline"), as further described in Clause 2.2 o f the Amendment Agreement. The Deadline was then extended to 30 June 2011 (the "Extended Deadline") through a unanimous vote in the Bondholders' meeting that took place on

<<<

 27 May 2011.
In the First Bondholders' Meeting the Maturity Date was extended from 28 February 2011 to 30 November 2015 and, in return, the Bondholders were among other things granted a fully subordinated mortgage over 12 vessels, implying

<<<

 that the Bondholders may not enforce their rights under the Security Documents or the Loan Agreement or accelerate the Loan until the Bank Loans are settled in full.
In order to enter into such a mortgage position, the Company, the Syndicate

<<<

 Banks and the Bond Trustee, on behalf o f the Bondholders, will have to enter into an intercreditor deed (the "Bond ICD"). According to the Company, the Bond ICD mirrors to a large extent the intercreditor deed that the

Syndicate Banks have entered into with the swap banks (ranking ahead o f the Loan), and therefore

<<<

 there is consequently little room for amendments. The background is explained in a letter from the Company dated 8 July 2011 enclosed as Exhibit A together with the draft Bond ICD enclosed as Exhibit B.
The Bond ICD contains features not customary

<<<

 in the Norwegian bond market and the Bond Trustee has engaged the law firm DLA Piper ("DLA") as its legal advisors. DLA has pointed out some o f the features, effects and implications o f the Bond ICD which may be o f importance to the Bondholders

<<<

, would include (but each Bondholder must individually assess implications, and the below is not intended to nor does it constitute a complete or exhaustive representation in this regard):
(a) a full subordination o f the claims of the Bondholders

<<<

 in both priority o f payment and in an insolvency o f the Borrower (and with respect to any recovery), in outline and inter alia entailing that the Bondholders will only be entitled to receive cash interest payments (as permitted payments)

<<<

 from the Borrower subject to and as long as no potential event o f default or event o f default has occurred under the Syndicate Banks' loan facilities (also with additional conditions as set in Clauses 4.7 and 4.8 o f the Bond ICD applying

<<<

), and no recovery o f principal or other amounts accrued or due to the Bondholders nor any entitlement for the Bondholders to accelerate or enforce (including a full waiver o f set-off rights) their claims under the Loan Agreement subject to

<<<

 and until the Syndicate Banks have received full repayment o f their outstandings under the Syndicate Banks' loan facilities, cf. inter alia the Bond ICD Clause 4, as well as the payment waterfalls and related references set out in Clauses

<<<

 83. to 8.5.
The above is, however, subject to certain limited modifications/exemptions, inter alia\
(i) limited follow-in rights for the Bondholders in case o f enforcement by the Syndicate Banks or in the case o f an insolvency o f the Issuer

<<<

 or an Owner, cf. the Bond ICD Clause 4.4 (a) and (b);
(ii) (exercisable only after the scheduled maturity dated for the Loan) buy-out right in respect o f the Syndicate Banks' loan facilities and a right to terminate/cancel the Bond ICD, cf

<<<

. the Bond ICD Clause 7.1 (a) and (b);
(b) the Syndicate Banks have reserved extensive rights to amend the terms o f the Syndicate Bank facilities, however so that limited exemptions apply to new advances o f principal and amendments o f the

<<<

 Syndicate Banks' original scheduled final repayment date, cf. clause 6.10 o f the Bond ICD, as well as set out in the Bond ICD Clause 6.13
(c) the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders have extensive cooperation duties/obligations, and will be required

<<<

 to grant extensive powers of attorney to the Syndicate Banks under the Bond ICD, whereby the Syndicate Banks inter alia will be empowered and authorized to perform a number o f acts on behalf o f the Bondholders and for which the Bondholders

<<<

 will remain liable (including to cast votes on behalf o f the Bondholders in reorganization or administration o f the Borrower, cf. inter alia the Bond ICD Clauses 6.12, c f 9). Additionally, the Syndicate Banks will be entitled to grant waivers

<<<

 and consents with binding effect for the Bondholders and in respect o f the Finance Documents (including as such decisions would affect original terms o f the Loan Agreement and without a requirement to consult with the Bond Trustee or Bondholders

<<<

), effectively and for all practical purposes cancelling out key decision making mechanisms in the Loan Agreement for as long as the Bond ICD is in force.
Consequently, the Bondholders are recommended to read the entire draft Bond ICD carefully

Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons

<<<

 together with the enclosed documents (published at www.starndata.no').
2. Default interest
The Bond ICD prohibits the Bondholders' to declare the Loan to be in default, also in case o f a payment default. Therefore, the Loan Agreement (as amended

<<<

) shall be amended so that default interest will automatically accrue after a payment default or breach o f covenants or upon the occurrence o f an Event o f Default.
3. STX deferred payments
The Syndicate Banks impose limitations on the Borrower

<<<

's ability to pay under the agreement with STX in respect o f deferred payments under the shipbuilding contracts and for the avoidance o f doubt it is agreed that "financial indebtedness" as referred to in Clause 15.1 (c) o f the Loan Agreement

 shall not include any indebtedness towards STX.
4. Extended Deadline Pursuant to the resolutions adopted by Bondholders' meetings on 18 February 2011 and 27 May 2011, the Company was granted a deadline o f 30 June 2011 to fulfill certain conditions

<<<

 in respect of the resolutions (the "BM CPs") adopted by the said Bondholders' meetings (the "Deadline"). If the BM CPs are not met within the Deadline, the Loan becomes due immediately. It is proposed that the Deadline is extended to 15 August

<<<

 2011.
5. Non-reliance Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by any o f the Bond Trustee and DLA. The Bondholders should independently evaluate the Proposal set out in Clause 5 below and vote accordingly.

8 July 2011
Dear Bondholders,
Finalisation of Primorsk Group Restructuring
We are grateful to Bondholders and the

<<<

 Bond Trustee for their patient support of Primorsk during the negotiation of our restructuring arrangements.
A key objective of the Restructuring has been to provide Bondholders with additional new security by way of Ship Mortgages over 12

<<<

 tanker vessels, we now have the consent of our Senior Lenders to this on the basis of the Intercreditor Deed submitted to you (along with the other Bond Loan Amendments) for approval.
On 18th February 2011 the Bondholders unanimously agreed

<<<

 to the proposed restructuring plan, including the terms of the "fully subordinated" mortgages to the prior ranking security of our Senior Lenders lead by Nordea and Banque Paribas. The Senior Lenders have, as expected, required that Bondholders

<<<

 enter into a standard form of intercreditor deed (the "Bond ICD") (as mentioned in the Bondholders' summons dated 20th February 2011) for the regulation of ship mortgage security. The standard nature of the intercreditor deed is evidenced by

<<<

 the fact that substantially the same form regulates the relationship between junior and senior ranking securities among our Senior Lender Group.
Wc have, after extensive negotiation, secured in favour of Bondholders two significant carve-outs

<<<

 from the standard form. The first is a right to buy-out the Senior Lenders in certain circumstances and the second is a right to revert to an unsubordinated basis if this is in Bondholders' interest at or after the Bond Maturity.
We consider

<<<

 that the Bondholder position is greatly enhanced by the additional 12 ship mortgages and that the proposed Intercreditor Deed regulates the position in the manner originally intended and offered to Bondholders. Therefore we ask for your positive

<<<

 vote to the approval of the Bond ICD so that the Company can complete the restructuring and concentrate on its future.
