Notes to the accounts for 2017
Note - 1 Accounting Principles
Oceanic Champion AS was incorporated 26 February 2013 and acquired the vessel Oceanic Champion from its sister company, Norfield Shipping AS in April

<<<

<<<

 currency in USD.
Bareboat income Operation income from the chartering of vessels is recognized at the time of delivery. Earnings recognized in line with accrued revenues. The percentage of freight revenue relating to future charter is recorded

<<<

 as accrued income and recognized thereafter as the charter is delivered.
Balance sheet classification Net current assets comprise creditors due within one year, and entries related to goods circulation. Other entries are classified as fixed

<<<

 assets and/or long-term creditors.
Current assets are valued at the lower of acquisition cost and fair value. Short term creditors are recognized at nominal value.
Fixed assets are valued by the cost of acquisition, in the case of non-incidental

<<<

 reduction in value the asset will be written down to the fair value amount. Long term creditors are recognized at nominal value.
Long-term loans are recognized at nominal value at the time of delivery.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables

<<<

 and other current receivables are recorded in the balance sheet at nominal value less provisions for doubtful debts. Provisions for doubtful debts are calculated based on individual assessments. In addition, for the remainder of accounts receivables

<<<

 outstanding balances, a general provision is made on expected loss.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions are translated using the year end exchange rates.
Vessel and equipment Tangible assets are capitalized and depreciated

<<<

 over the estimated useful life. Direct maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, while improvements are capitalized and depreciated along with the asset. If the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying value it is written

<<<

 down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of net selling price and value in use.
Depreciation of the fleet is calculated using the straight-line method over a useful life of 20-25 years. The amortization period and

<<<

 method are reviewed annually.
Docking / classification cost of vessels are capitalized and recognized as depreciation until the next docking / classification. Other maintenance is charged to operations immediately. In cases where the completed

<<<

 works include additions or improvements that represent quality of a significant duration, the costs associated with this will be capitalized on the ship and depreciated over the remaining useful life.
Damage repairs, less deductible, are capitalized

<<<

 and classified as current assets pending reimbursement from insurance underwriters.
Income tax The company was incorporated in 2013 and entered into the tonnage tax system from inauguration.

Depreciation is calculated as a combined consideration of contract value (2,5 years remaining) and vessel value (17 years remaining life time). The book value of the vessel

 at 44,8 MUSD is substantiated by the long term bareboat charter in combination with broker estimates.

Due to the current market conditions, there are uncertainties with respect to the valuation of the vessel which is based on broker estimates

. If the challenging market situation persists, the vessel value may deteriorate further in which case additional impairment on vessel book value may be required.

 auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISA s). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial

<<<

 to the General Meeting of Oceanic Champion AS

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern

<<<

. The financial statements use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable

<<<

 assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but

<<<

 is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISA s will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can

<<<

 arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in

<<<

 accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISA s, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess

<<<

 the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis

<<<

 for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal

<<<

 control.
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company

<<<

's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern

<<<

 basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that

<<<

 a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the

<<<

 audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial

<<<

 statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other

<<<

 matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Opinion on the

<<<

 Board of Directors' report
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors' report concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption

<<<

, and the proposal for the coverage of the loss is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations.
