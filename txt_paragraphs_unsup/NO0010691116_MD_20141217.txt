 COURT On 28 November 2014, a petition filed by Oceanografia S.A. de C.V. ("Oceanografia) before a Mexican bankruptcy court was published. In the petition, Oceanografia was requesting a seizure (aseguramiento) over, among other vessels, the

<<<

 OSA Goliath (the "Vessel"). The reason for the petition was an alleged need to preserve any right over the assets of the Oceanografia and to maintain the viability of the company. The Mexican bankruptcy court has as of 11 December 2014 rejected

<<<

 the petition for the seizure due to the fact that the Vessel is not owned by Oceanografia, but rather by OSA Goliath Pte. Ltd. The judgement may be appealed. Nordic Trustee ASA is of the opinion that the judgement of the bankruptcy court is

 correct and that it has made a correct assessment of the ownership of the Vessel. The Vessel will continue to be marketed towards potential interested parties by H. Clarkson & Co Ltd.
