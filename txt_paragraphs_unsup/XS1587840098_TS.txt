 interest payments on the Notes are paid. The cancellation or other non-payment of interest as provided in Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) will not constitute an event of default or entitle any action to be taken by Noteholders.
In the event

 that the CET1 ratio of the Issuer is less than 5.125 per cent. or the CET1 ratio of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation is less than 7.00 per cent. (each, a "Trigger Event"), in each case as calculated in accordance with the CRD IV requirements

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING AND SALES TO RETAIL INVESTORS
The Notes discussed in this Prospectus are complex financial

<<<

 instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors. In some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws, regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the

<<<

 Notes to retail investors.
In particular, in June 2015, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") published the Product Intervention (Contingent Convertible Instruments and Mutual Society Shares) Instrument 2015 (the "PI Instrument"),

<<<

 which took effect on 1 October 2015. Under the rules set out in the PI Instrument (as amended or replaced from time to time, the "PI Rules"):
(i) certain contingent write-down or convertible securities (including any beneficial interests therein

<<<

), such as securities having features substantially similar to the Notes, must not be sold to retail clients in the European Economic Area (the "EEA"); and
(ii) there must not be any communication or approval of an invitation or inducement to

<<<

 participate in, acquire or underwrite such securities (or the beneficial interest in such securities) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the

<<<

 EEA (in each case, within the meaning of the PI Rules), other than in accordance with the limited exemptions set out in the PI Rules.
By purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes (or the beneficial interest in such

<<<

 Notes) from the Issuer and/or any of Danske Bank A/S and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) (together, the "Joint Lead Managers"), each prospective investor represents, warrants, agrees with, and undertakes to, the Issuer and the Joint

<<<

 Lead Managers that:
(a) it is not a retail client in the EEA (as defined in the PI Rules);
(b) whether or not it is subject to the PI Rules, it will not (i) sell or offer the Notes (or any beneficial interest therein) to retail clients in the

<<<

 EEA, or (ii) communicate (including the distribution of this Prospectus) or approve an invitation or inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) where that invitation or inducement is

<<<

 addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the PI Rules), other than (A) in relation to any sale or offer to sell Notes (or any beneficial interest

<<<

 therein) to a retail client in or resident in the United Kingdom, in circumstances that do not and will not give rise to a contravention of the PI Rules by any person and/or (B) in relation to any sale or offer to sell Notes (or any beneficial

<<<

 interest therein) to a retail client in any EEA member state other than the United Kingdom, where (x) it has conducted an assessment and concluded that the relevant retail client understands the risks of an investment in the Notes (or such

<<<

 beneficial interests therein) and is able to bear the potential losses involved in an investment in the Notes and (y) it has at all times acted in relation to such sale or offer in compliance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive

<<<

 (2004/39/EC) ("MiFID") to the extent it applies to it or, to the extent MiFID does not apply to it, in a manner which would be in compliance with MiFID if it were to apply to it; and
(c) it will at all times comply with all applicable laws

<<<

, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside the EEA) relating to the promotion, offering, distribution and/or sale of the Notes, including (without limitation) any such laws, regulations and regulatory guidance relating

<<<

 to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) by investors in any relevant jurisdiction.
Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed client when purchasing

<<<

, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers, the foregoing representations, warranties, agreements and
4

undertakings will be given by and be

<<<

 binding upon both the agent and its underlying client. Investment in the Notes may be considered by eligible investors who are in a position to give the above representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings and to be able to satisfy

<<<

 themselves that the Notes would constitute an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless it has the expertise (either alone or with the help of

<<<

 a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment portfolio.

This Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy Notes in any jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make the

<<<

 offer or solicitation in such jurisdiction. The distribution of this Prospectus and the offer or sale of the Notes may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. The Issuer and the Joint Lead Managers do not represent that this Prospectus

<<<

<<<

 for facilitating any such distribution or offering. In particular, no action has been taken by the Issuer or the Joint Lead Managers which would permit a public offering of the Notes or distribution of this document in any jurisdiction where

<<<

The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors. Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should consider

<<<

, either on its own or with the help of its financial and other professional advisers, whether it:
(i) has sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the

<<<

 information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;
(ii) has access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment

<<<

 in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;

<<<

's financial activities are principally denominated is different from Swedish krona, the currency in which principal and interest payments on the Notes will be made;
(iv) understands thoroughly the terms of the Notes and is familiar with the

<<<

 behaviour of financial markets; and
(v) is able to evaluate possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
The Notes are complex financial instruments

<<<

 and such instruments may be purchased as a way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to the investor's overall portfolio. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless it has

<<<

 the expertise (either alone or with the assistance of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of such Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential

<<<

 investor's overall investment portfolio.

<<<

 authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (1) the Notes are legal investments for it, (2) the Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other

<<<

 restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar

<<<

 rules.

RISK FACTORS
In purchasing the Notes, investors assume the risk that the Issuer

<<<

 may become insolvent or otherwise be unable to make all payments due in respect o f the Notes. There is a wide range o ffactors which individually or together could result in the Issuer becoming unable to make all payments due in respect o

<<<

 f the Notes. It is not possible to identify all such factors or to determine which factors are most likely to occur, as the Issuer may not be aware o f all relevant factors and certain factors which it currently deems not to be material may

<<<

 become material as a result o f the occurrence o f events outside the Issuer's control. The Issuer has identified in this Prospectus a number o f factors which could materially adversely affect its business and ability to make payments due

<<<

 under the Notes. Most o f these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring.
In addition, factors which are material for the

<<<

 purpose o f assessing the risks associated with the Notes are also described below.
The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest

<<<

, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notesfor other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it or which it may not currently be able to anticipate.

<<<

 Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
Words and expressions

<<<

 defined in the Conditions or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same meanings in this section.
RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER
Factors that may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes
As a result of its business

<<<

 activities, the Issuer is exposed to a variety of risks, the most significant of which are systemic risk, credit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. Failure to control these risks could result in a material adverse effect

<<<

 on the Issuer's financial performance and reputation.
Further, the Issuer's business could also be affected by competition and other factors such as general economic and business conditions, including changes in the economic climate, both nationally

<<<

 and internationally, changes regarding taxation, interest rate developments, inflation, political changes, regulatory changes and changes in the financial markets.
Systemic risk
Due to the high level of interdependence between financial institutions

<<<

, the Issuer is subject to the risk of deterioration of the actual or perceived commercial and financial soundness of other financial institutions. A default or financial difficulties of one financial institution may have negative consequences

<<<

 for other financial institutions and may lead to liquidity problems, losses, defaults or worsening of general economic climate in the markets in which the Issuer operates.
Credit risk
The Issuer's financial performance is affected by borrower

<<<

 and counterparty credit quality and general economic conditions. Risks arising from the credit quality of borrowers and counterparties and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties in derivative transactions are inherent

<<<

 in the Issuer's businesses. Adverse changes in the credit quality of the Issuer's borrowers and counterparties or a general deterioration in the Swedish, European or global economic conditions, or arising from systemic risks in the financial

<<<

 systems, could affect the recoverability and value of its assets and require an increase in the Issuer's provision for bad and doubtful loans and other provisions.
The Issuer's business will also be affected during recessionary conditions when

<<<

 certain customers may face financial problems. Interest rate rises may also have an impact on the ability of customers to meet their loan obligations.
14

Large exposures (or concentration risk)
The Issuer is also subject to concentration

<<<

 risk, being risks related to large (connected) individual exposures and significant exposures to groups of counterparts whose likelihood of default is driven by common underlying factors, e.g. sector, economy, geographical location, instrument

<<<

 type.
Market risk
The Issuer's funding may be influenced by several factors such as the liquidity of global financial markets, interest rates, investor sentiment, inflation and the availability and cost of funding which are related to the economic

<<<

 cycle.
Interest risk
Interest risks arise when interest fixing periods or interest bases for assets and liabilities are mismatched.
Currency risk
Currency risks arise when the present value of assets and liabilities, including derivative positions

<<<

, in a foreign currency are mismatched.
Basis-spread risk and credit-spread risk
Basis-spread risk arises when the currency risk that arises in conjunction with borrowing in a foreign currency is reduced by swapping payments in foreign currency

<<<

 for payments in Swedish currency through cross-currency interest-rate swaps. Credit-spread risk arises from fluctuations in credit spreads in the Issuer's liquidity portfolio and its effect impact earnings.
Operational risk
The Issuer is dependent

<<<

 on the ability to process transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risk and losses can result from fraud or other external or internal crime, errors by employees, equipment failures, natural disasters, failure of external systems

<<<

 or failure to comply with internal or external rules and regulations. Although such risks are reduced through active efforts relating to risk culture, compliance with regulations and corporate governance, it cannot be guaranteed that such procedures

<<<

 will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks.
Notwithstanding anything in this risk factor, this risk factor should not be taken as implying that either the Issuer or the Group (as defined under "Information Relating to the

<<<

 Issuer") will be unable to comply with its obligations as a company with securities admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or as a supervised firm regulated by the SFSA.
Liquidity risk
The inability of a financial institution

<<<

, including the Issuer, to anticipate and provide for unforeseen decreases or changes in funding sources could have consequences on such institution's ability to meet its payment obligations when they fall due. As part of its funding, the Issuer

<<<

 accepts deposits from the general public which are repayable on demand and which may have an impact on the liquidity of the Issuer. Furthermore, if the Issuer's inability to meet its payment obligations when they fall due is not temporary it

<<<

 could mean that the Issuer might be considered as insolvent.
The Issuer is also subject to liquidity requirements in its capacity as a credit institution supervised by the SFSA, including a statutory requirement to maintain sufficient liquidity

<<<

 to enable it to discharge its obligations as they fall due. The SFSA has issued regulations on liquidity (including FFFS 2010:7 and FFFS 2012:6). Serious or systematic deviations from such regulations may lead to the SFSA determining that the

<<<

 Issuer's business does not satisfy the statutory soundness requirement for credit institutions and could result in the SFSA imposing sanctions against the Issuer.
15

Economic and business risks
Risks relating to the Swedish agriculture andforestry

<<<

 market
The Issuer and its borrowers are impacted by the trends and conditions in the agriculture and forestry sectors. Farmers have faced challenges including the Russian embargo on agricultural products and the weak economic trend in Europe

<<<

, but have benefitted from continued low market interest rates. The Russian import restrictions had greatest impact on the dairy industry with a consequential fall in milk prices for dairy companies. The proposed changes in European agricultural

<<<

 policy discussed in 2014 have been decided and will result in changes. However, it remains uncertain how Swedish agriculture will be affected; any negative changes could in turn affect the Issuer's business and results of operations.
Risks

<<<

 relating to disruptions in the global credit markets and economy
Financial markets are subject to periods of historic volatility and the economic climate in the region is exposed to political risk, which may impact the Issuer's ability to raise

<<<

 debt in a similar manner, and at a similar cost, to the funding raised in the past. Challenging market conditions may result in greater volatility and reduced liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in credit

<<<

 markets, which may affect the Issuer. Changes in the investment markets, including changes in interest rates, exchange rates and returns from equity, property and other investments, may affect the financial performance of the Issuer. In addition

<<<

, the financial performance of the Issuer could be adversely affected by a worsening of general economic conditions or political climate in the markets and regions in which it operates. There are uncertainties as to the current political climate

<<<

 globally, including (but not limited to) the recent change of administration in the United States and the United Kingdom voting in favour of leaving the European Union ("EU"). The possibility of an extended period of political uncertainty and

<<<

 financial market volatility as a result of such politically sensitive events may also adversely affect the financial performance of the Issuer and its ability to raise debt in the international capital markets.
Further business and operational

<<<

 risks
External risk
There is also a risk that the Issuer's reputation will be damaged if the Issuer fails to comply with current legislation and best practice or fails in another manner to meet its commitments.
The Issuer's business is subject

<<<

 to regulation and regulatory supervision pursuant to directives, laws, regulations and policies issued by, inter alia, the EU and Sweden. Any significant regulatory developments could have an effect on how the Issuer conducts its business and

<<<

 on the Issuer's results of operations. This supervision and regulation, in particular in the EU and Sweden, if changed, could materially affect the Issuer's business, the products and services it offers or the value of its assets. In the aftermath

<<<

 of the global economic crisis, many initiatives for regulatory changes have been taken and the impact of such initiatives is still difficult to predict in full.
The Issuer's performance is subject to substantial competitive pressures that could

<<<

 adversely affect its results of operations. There is substantial competition for the type of business that the Issuer provides. Such competition is affected by customers demand, technological changes, the impact of consolidation, regulatory

<<<

 actions and other factors.
The Issuer's customers are exposed to environmental risks. Environmental risk is defined as natural disasters such as droughts, storms, pollutions and animal diseases. An outburst of a disease or a natural disaster

<<<

 striking a specific land area, could adversely affect the value of the property or business, leading to deterioration of the collateral value and/or the customer migrating to less favourable credit classes.
Political risk
Since the Issuer's

<<<

 customers are mainly landowners they are inevitably exposed to international rules and agreements regarding agricultural policy. Political decisions regarding the community legislation such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), World Trade

<<<

 Organization (WTO) etc. - could have
16

an impact on the credit quality of the Issuer's customers in a long-term horizon, due to the level of state granted supports to that particular business or land type.
The Issuer's guidelines and policies

<<<

 for risk management may prove to be inadequate with respect to unidentified and unforeseen risks
The management of business, regulatory and legal risks requires, among other things, guidelines and policies for the accurate registration and

<<<

 control of a large number of transactions and events. Such guidelines and policies may not always be adequate. Some methods used by the Issuer to estimate, measure and manage risk are based on perceived historic market behaviour and may therefore

<<<

 prove to be inadequate for predicting future risk exposure. Other methods for risk management are based on evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other information that is publicly known or otherwise available to the Issuer

<<<

. Such information has not always been and may not always be accurate or correctly evaluated or a reliable indicator of default and may therefore be inadequate for the purpose of risk management, which may in turn have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on the Issuer's financial condition and results of operations.
The Issuer's funding costs and its access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on its credit ratings
Any downgrade of the Issuer's credit ratings could increase its

<<<

 borrowing costs, adversely affect the liquidity position of the Issuer, limit its access to the capital markets, undermine confidence in and the competitive position of the Issuer, or trigger obligations under certain bilateral terms in some

<<<

 of its trading and collateralised financing contracts, including requiring the provision of additional collateral as well as limiting the range of counterparties willing to enter into transactions with the Issuer. Any of the events above could

<<<

 have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's business and results of operations.
Risks relating to the Issuer's collateral
Given that a considerable part of the Issuer's loans are secured by mortgage certificates (Sw. pantbrev) in properties

<<<

 located in Sweden, the credit risk is partly related to the performance of the real estate and agricultural and forestry market in Sweden. There can be no guarantees regarding the future development of the value of the collateral. When collateral

<<<

 is enforced, a court order may be needed to establish the borrower's obligation to pay and to enable a sale by execution measures. The Issuer's ability to enforce the collateral without the consent of the borrower is thus dependent on the abovementioned

<<<

 decisions from a court and the execution measures and on other relevant circumstances in the mortgage market and in the demand for the relevant real property. Should the prices of real property and the agricultural and forestry market substantially

<<<

 decline, this would affect the Issuer. There are many circumstances that affect the level of credit loss, early repayments, withdrawals and final payments of interest and principal amounts, such as changes in the economic climate, both nationally

<<<

 and internationally, changes regarding taxation, interest rate developments, inflation and political changes.
The Issuer is exposed to tax-related risks and risks of changes in tax legislation
On 1 January 2017, new legislation came into force

<<<

 in Sweden, abolishing the income tax deductibility for interest payments on capital instruments and subordinated loans qualifying as Additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital under the Capital Requirements Regulation (as defined below).

<<<

 Since the legislation came into effect very recently, it is currently not possible to predict the extent of the impact on the Issuer's business. However, it is likely that the rules will increase the overall tax burden for the Issuer which

<<<

 could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The rules may also affect the overall financial stability of the Issuer and other institutions affected by the rules.
The Issuer's business and transactions

<<<

 are conducted in accordance with the Issuer's interpretation of applicable laws, tax treaties, regulations, case law and requirements of the tax authorities. However, there can be no assurances that its interpretation of applicable laws, tax

<<<

 treaties, regulations, case law or other rules or administrative practice is correct, or that such rules or practice will not change, possibly with retroactive effect. For example, on 7 November 2016, a government committee which was appointed

<<<

 in May 2015, presented its report "Tax on financial services" to the government. The committee was appointed under the assumption that the financial services sector, in comparison to other sectors, has a tax advantage due to financial services

<<<

 being exempt from VAT. The committee
17

proposed that a financial activity tax of 15 per cent. be introduced, designed as a form of additional salary tax. However, the proposal has been heavily criticised during the consultation for comments

<<<

, mainly for being too broad in its scope, and on 24 February 2017, the government therefore announced that it will withdraw the proposal but begin drafting a new tax proposal that will be more narrowly directed at banks. It is currently not

<<<

 possible to predict if or when a new proposal will be presented or what it will look like. The Issuer's tax situation for previous, current and future years may change as a result of legislative changes such as that mentioned above, decisions

<<<

 made by the tax authorities or as a result of changed tax treaties, regulations, case law or requirements of the tax authorities. Such decisions or changes, potentially with retroactive effect, could adversely affect the Issuer's business,

<<<

 financial condition and results of operations.
Increased capital requirements
The implementation of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (the "Capital Requirements Regulation"

<<<

 or "CRR") and European Council Directive (Directive 2013/36/EU) on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms (the "CRD IV Directive" and, together with CRR, "CRD

<<<

 IV") has resulted in higher capital requirements. CRR and the CRD IV Directive are also supported by a set of binding technical standards currently being developed by the European Banking Authority (the "EBA"). The regulatory framework will

<<<

 continue to evolve and any resulting changes could have a material impact on the Issuer's business.
The changes to the capital adequacy framework include, inter alia, stricter minimum capital requirements for the components in the capital base

<<<

 with the highest quality: common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital must be at least 4.5 per cent. of risk weighted assets at all times and tier 1 capital 6.0 per cent. The minimum total capital (or 'own funds') requirement (tier 1 capital plus

<<<

 tier 2 capital) is 8.0 per cent. of the total risk exposure amount. In addition to the minimum capital requirements, CRD IV introduces further capital buffer requirements that are required to be satisfied with CET1 capital. Certain buffers

<<<

 may be applicable to the Issuer as determined by the SFSA. A breach of the combined buffer requirements will result in restrictions on certain capital distributions from the bank, for example, dividend and coupon payments on CET1 and tier 

<<<

1 capital instruments. However, the Issuer is currently not considered as a systemically important institution and is thus not subject to the buffer requirement for systemically important institutions. The Issuer is also not subject to the systemic

<<<

 risk buffer requirements. There can, however, be no assurance that the Issuer will not be designated a systemically important institution or subject to systemic risk buffer requirements in the future.
At its meeting on 10 January 2016, the

<<<

 Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (the "GHOS") published its final standard on market risk (the "Fundamental Review o f the Trading Book" (the "FRTB")), which is now part of the European Commission's legislative package

<<<

 intended to apply to banks from 2021. When implemented, the FRTB will be subject to a phase-in period of three years during which banks will be allowed a 35 per cent. discount factor for the FRTB applying until 2024.
In November 2016, the European

<<<

 Commission proposed extensive changes to the EU regulatory framework, which included the FRTB, the Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"), the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities ("MREL"), the Pillar 2 framework, a leverage

<<<

 ratio of 3 per cent. and a phase-in of IFRS 9 capital effects. These changes are largely proposed to be implemented in 2021 (with a 35 per cent. discount factor for the FRTB applying until 2024).
The countercyclical buffer rate is a capital

<<<

 requirement which varies over time and is to be used to support credit supply in adverse market conditions. The countercyclical capital buffer for Sweden is currently 1.5 per cent. although, from 19 March 2017, the countercyclical capital buffer

<<<

 for Sweden will be raised to 2 per cent. Such measures and any other changes in the risk weighting of assets may cause reductions in the capital adequacy ratios and solvency levels of the Issuer and/or cause the applicable minimum capital requirements

<<<

 to increase.
There can be no assurance that the methods that the SFSA plans to use to evaluate the capital requirements as regards the three most important risk types within other Pillar 2 requirements (namely credit-related concentration risk

<<<

, interest rate risk in the banking book and pension risk) will not change over time. The SFSA may also introduce additional methods for assessment of Pillar 2 risks. On 24 May 2016, the SFSA established new standards for assessing models applied

<<<

 for calculating the capital
18

requirement for credit risk, primarily for corporate exposures. These methods may increase the Issuer's capital requirements for credit risk, primarily for corporate exposures. On 24 May 2016, the SFSA also

<<<

 established new pillar 2 requirements for banks applying the advanced internal ratings based approach (A-IRB) for calculating credit risk. The Issuer currently uses an IRB approach for retail exposures and has applied for a permission to use

<<<

 an IRB approach for corporate exposures as well.
In November 2016, the European Commission published a package of proposed amendments to the Pillar 2 framework, which differ substantially from the approach currently applied by the SFSA and

<<<

 could lead to decreases in overall capital requirements for Swedish banks. The proposal makes a clear distinction between Pillar 2 capital requirements ("P2R") and Pillar 2 guidance ("P2G"). P2R will be mandatory, positioned above minimum requirements

<<<

 and below the combined buffer requirement, to address risks not covered or not sufficiently covered by Pillar 1 and capital buffer requirements. Capital add-ons for systemic risk and macro-prudential risk, such as the 2 per cent. systemic risk

<<<

 and the increase of the mortgage risk weight floor from 15 per cent. to 25 per cent. imposed on Swedish banks by the SFSA in January 2015 are explicitly excluded from P2R. P2G, on the other hand, refers to the ability of competent authorities

<<<

 to require institutions to hold capital in excess of Pillar 1 capital requirements, P2R and combined buffer requirements in order to address forward-looking or remote situations. As this guidance, according to the proposal, constitutes a capital

<<<

 target, it is positioned above the combined buffer requirement. In addition to risk-based capital ratio requirements, the Basel III framework also introduced a non-risk based leverage ratio as a supplement to the risk-based capital requirements

<<<

. The leverage ratio has been reported to regulators since 1 January 2014 and publicly disclosed since 1 January 2015.
The conditions of the Issuer's businesses as well as external conditions are constantly changing and the full set of capital

<<<

 adequacy rules applicable to Swedish financial institutions continues to evolve. For the foregoing reasons, the Issuer may need to raise additional capital in the future. Such capital, whether in the form of debt financing, hybrid capital or

<<<

 additional equity, may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. The Issuer is unable to predict what regulatory requirements may be imposed in the future or accurately estimate the impact that any currently proposed regulatory changes

<<<

 may have on its business, the products and services that it offers or the values of its assets. For example, if the Issuer is required to make additional provisions, increase its reserves or capital, or exit or change its approach to certain

<<<

 businesses as a result of the initiatives to strengthen the regulation of credit institutions, this could adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition. Banks that are considered systemically important in the context of

<<<

 the Swedish banking system, which currently comprise the four major Swedish banks, are subject to more stringent requirements than other banks. The requirement for additional capital at a later stage could encompass more banks, including the

<<<

 Issuer.
In light of the structural developments, regulatory changes and following a dialogue with the SFSA, the Issuer has decided to change its customer classification. Swedish farmers conducting businesses as sole traders but with large enterprises

<<<

 will be reclassified and treated as corporates (rather than retail customers) from a regulatory capital perspective. This change means that the Issuer will be subject to an increased regulatory capital requirement. On 30 September 2016, the

<<<

 Issuer therefore applied for a permission to use an internal ratings based (IRB) model for these corporate exposures, in addition to its existing IRB model for retail exposures. As a consequence thereof, it also applied for certain changes

<<<

 to the existing IRB model for retail exposures. The approval process is in the discretion of the SFSA. The Issuer expresses no opinion on the likelihood of receiving a permission or of the timing for the approval process, and a non-approval

<<<

 or an extended approval process could have a material adverse effect of the Issuer's business, capitalisation and operations.
Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
To complement the CRD IV legislative package, EU credit institutions are subject

<<<

 to a directive providing for the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (Directive 2014/59/EU) (known as the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive or "BRRD"). The BRRD

<<<

 establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and, inter alia, requires EU credit institutions to produce and maintain recovery plans setting out the arrangements that may be taken to restore the long-term viability

<<<

 of the institution in the event of a material deterioration of its financial position. The BRRD has been implemented into Swedish law by the Resolution Act (Sw. Lag (2015:1016) om resolution) and the Precautionary Support Act (Sw. Lag (201

<<<

5:1017) omförebyggande statligt stöd till kreditinstitut). The National Debt
19

Office (Sw. Riksgaldskontoret) has been appointed as resolution authority and has been given certain powers which can be categorised into preventive powers, early

<<<

 intervention powers and resolution powers. Ultimately, the authority may take control of a failing institution and, for example, transfer the institution to a private purchaser or to a publicly controlled entity pending a private sector arrangement

<<<

. All these actions can be taken without any prior shareholder approval.
The BRRD contains a number of resolution tools and powers which may be applied by the resolution authority upon certain conditions for resolution being fulfilled. These

<<<

 tools and powers may be used alone or in combination, and include, inter alia, a power to write-down all or a portion of the principal amount of, or interest on, certain other eligible liabilities (which could include the Notes), whether subordinated

<<<

 or unsubordinated, of an institution in resolution and/or to convert certain unsecured debt claims, including senior notes and subordinated notes (such as the Notes), into another security. This means that most of such failing institution's

<<<

 debt could be subject to bail-in, except for certain classes of debt, such as deposits and secured liabilities. Further, the BRRD provides for relevant authorities to have the further power, before any other resolution action is taken, to permanently

<<<

 write-down or convert into equity relevant capital instruments such as the Notes at the point of non-viability (see the risk factor "Loss absorption at the point o fnon-viability o f the Issuer" below for further information).
One of the key

<<<

 principles in the BRRD is that the shareholders of a failing institution must bear the first losses in case of a failure. Prior to taking any resolution action that would result in losses for the creditors of the failing institution, the authorities

<<<

 must therefore impose losses on the shareholders by cancelling or severely diluting their shares. In general, shareholders' claims should be exhausted before those of subordinated creditors (such as the Noteholders) and only when those claims

<<<

 are exhausted can resolution authorities impose losses on senior claims.
The powers set out in the BRRD will impact how institutions are managed as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors. Under the BRRD regime, Noteholders

<<<

 may be subject to write down or conversion into equity on any application of the general bail-in tool and non-viability loss absorption. In such circumstances, this may result in Noteholders losing some or all of their investment. The general

<<<

 bail-in tool can be used to recapitalise an institution that is failing or about to fail, allowing authorities to restructure it through the resolution process and restore its viability after reorganisation and restructuring. The write-down

<<<

 and conversion power can be used either together with, or also, independently of, a resolution action. Other powers provided to resolution authorities under the BRRD in respect of debt instruments (which could include the Notes) include replacing

<<<

 or substituting the institution as obligor in respect of such debt instruments; modifying the terms of debt instruments (including altering the maturity and/or the amount of interest payable and/or imposing a temporary suspension on payments

<<<

), and/or discontinuing the listing and admission to trading of debt instruments. The exercise of any power under the BRRD or any suggestion of such exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the rights of Noteholders, the price

<<<

 or value of the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.
Going forward, the BRRD also impacts on how large a capital buffer an institution will need, in addition to those set out in the CRR and the

<<<

 CRD IV Directive. To ensure that institutions always have sufficient loss-absorbing capacity, the BRRD requires institutions to maintain at all times a sufficient aggregate amount of own funds (as defined in Article 4(1)(118) of the CRR) and

<<<

 'eligible liabilities' (namely, liabilities and other instruments that do not qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital and that may be bailed-in using the bail-in tool) - MREL - as referred to above under "Increased capital requirements". See "EBA

<<<

 draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on criteria for determining the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities under the BRRD" below for further information regarding the determination of an institution's MREL under the

<<<

 BRRD. Eligible liabilities may be senior or subordinated, provided they have a remaining maturity of at least one year and, if governed by a non-EU law, they must be able to be written down or converted under that law or through contractual

<<<

 provisions.
In November 2016, the European Commission proposed changes to the BRRD with a focus on the implementation of the Financial Stability Board's standard for total loss absorbing capacity ("TLAC") into EU legislation and the alignment

<<<

 of the TLAC requirement with MREL rules to avoid duplication. While the TLAC requirement is proposed to be applicable only to global systemically important banks (known as G-SIBs) (and hence not to the Issuer), the Issuer expects that the MREL

<<<

 implementation by the National Debt Office will need to be amended in line with the final outcome of the proposed changes to the BRRD.
20

On 23 February 2017, the National Debt Office presented the finalised model for the calculation of MREL

<<<

, stating that systemically important institutions need to replace a portion of their existing bond holdings with subordinated bonds. Institutions which are not deemed as systemically important will not be affected by the framework presented

<<<

 by the National Debt Office; in a crisis, such institutions will be declared bankrupt or placed in liquidation rather than resolution. The model presented for the calculation of MREL will take effect from 1 January 2018 onwards and institutions

<<<

 must progressively build up the volume of subordinated liabilities required to meet the minimum requirement by 2022. Since it has not yet been determined whether the Issuer will be treated as a systemically important institution or not for

<<<

 these purposes, as at the date of this Prospectus it is not possible to say how the Issuer will be affected by the new framework.
It is not possible to predict exactly how the powers and tools of the National Debt Office provided in the BRRD

<<<

 and the Resolution Act will affect the Issuer. Accordingly, it is not possible to assess the full impact of the BRRD and the Resolution Act on the Issuer. The powers and tools given to the National Debt Office are numerous and may have a significant

<<<

 impact on the Issuer and the Notes.
Loss absorption at the point o f non-viability of the Issuer
Noteholders are subject to the risk that the Notes may be required to absorb losses as a result of statutory powers conferred on resolution and

<<<

 competent authorities in Sweden (the National Debt Office and the SFSA). As noted above, the powers provided to resolution and competent authorities (the National Debt Office and the SFSA for Sweden) in the BRRD include write-down/conversion

<<<

 powers to ensure that relevant capital instruments (such as the Notes) fully absorb losses at the point of non-viability of the issuing institution in order to allow it to continue as a going concern subject to appropriate restructuring. As

<<<

 a result, the BRRD contemplates that resolution authorities may require the permanent write-down of such capital instruments (which write-down may be in full) or the conversion of them into CET1 instruments at the point of non-viability (which

<<<

 CET1 instruments may also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool described above) and before any other bailin or resolution tool can be used. Measures ultimately adopted in this area may apply to any debt currently in issue

<<<

, which will include the Notes.
For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point of non viability under the BRRD is the point at which one or more of the following circumstances apply: (a) the determination

<<<

 has been made by the relevant authority that the conditions for resolution have been met, before any resolution action is taken; (b) the relevant authority determines that unless the writedown/conversion power is exercised in relation to the

<<<

 relevant capital instruments, the institution "will no longer be viable" (as described in Article 59(4) of the BRRD) and/or (c) extraordinary public financial support is required by the institution.
The application of any non-viability loss

<<<

 absorption measure may result in Noteholders losing some or all of their investment. Any such conversion to equity or write-off of all or part of an investor's principal (including accrued but unpaid interest) shall not constitute an event

<<<

 of default and the Noteholders will have no further claims in respect of any amount so converted or written off. The exercise of any such power may be inherently unpredictable and may depend on a number of factors which may be outside the Issuer

<<<

's control. Any such exercise, or any suggestion that the Notes could become subject to such exercise, could, therefore, materially adversely affect the value of the Notes.
EBA draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on criteria for determining

<<<

 the minimum requirementfor ownfunds and eligible liabilities under the BRRD
As described above in the risk factor "Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive", in order to ensure the effectiveness of bail-in and other resolution tools introduced

<<<

 by the BRRD, the BRRD requires that all in-scope institutions have sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities available to absorb losses and contribute to recapitalisation if the bail-in tool were to be applied. Each institution must meet

<<<

 an individual MREL requirement, calculated as a percentage of total liabilities and own funds and set by the relevant resolution authorities (the National Debt Office for Sweden) on a case by case basis. The MREL requirement applies to all

<<<

 EU credit institutions (and certain investment firms), not just to those identified as being of a particular size or of systemic importance.
In determining an institution's MREL, the resolution authority must have regard to certain criteria

<<<

 specified in the BRRD and the MREL requirement for that institution will be comprised of a number of
21

key elements, including the required loss absorbing capacity of the institution (which will, as a minimum, equate to the institution's

<<<

 capital requirements under CRD IV, including applicable buffers), and the level of recapitalisation needed to implement the preferred resolution strategy identified during the resolution planning process.
Items eligible for inclusion in MREL

<<<

 will include an institution's own funds (within the meaning of CRD IV), along with "eligible liabilities", meaning liabilities which, inter alia, are issued and fully paid up, have a maturity of at least one year (or do not give the investor

<<<

 a right to repayment within one year), and do not arise from derivatives. The MREL requirement may also have to be met partially through the issuance of contractual bail-in instruments, being instruments that are effectively subordinated to

<<<

 other eligible liabilities in a bail-in or insolvency of the relevant institution.
BRRD's provisions relating to MREL will be supplemented by regulatory technical standards ("RTS") drafted by the EBA with a view to be adopted by the European

<<<

 Commission. The key RTS relate to the assessment criteria for determining an institution's MREL under the BRRD, the current version of which are set out in the Annex to an EBA Opinion published in February 2016.
It should be noted that the

<<<

 Resolution Act, in line with BRRD, requires that all in-scope institutions have sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities available to absorb losses and contribute to recapitalisation if the bail-in tool were to be applied (see Chapter

<<<

 4, section 3 of the Resolution Act).
On 10 November 2016, the National Debt Office communicated that it intends to publish a memorandum on the application of MREL during the first quarter of 2017. As stated above, on 23 February 2017, the National

<<<

 Debt Office presented the finalised model for the calculation of MREL, stating that systemically important institutions need to replace a portion of their existing bond holdings with subordinated bonds. However, it remains uncertain when the

<<<

 decision as to which institutions that are to be deemed as systemically important (and consequently what the MREL requirements for each institution will be) can be expected. The National Debt Office has stated that it intends to communicate

<<<

 such decision during 2017. Until then, broadly, the MREL will be set at a level equal to the institution's applicable capital requirements. It can be noted that not all institutions will be deemed systemically important for the purposes of

<<<

 the resolution regime. For institutions which are not so deemed, the MREL requirements will remain at the level of the institution's applicable capital requirements.
The extent and nature of the MREL requirements are currently being developed

<<<

 and so it is not possible to determine the exact impact that they will have on the Issuer once implemented. The proposals may require the Issuer to issue a significant amount of additional eligible liabilities in order to meet the new MREL

<<<

 requirements within the required timeframes. If the Issuer was to experience difficulties in raising eligible liabilities, it may have to reduce its lending or investments in other operations.
On 24 February 2017, the Swedish government presented

<<<

 a proposal on an increased annual fee to the resolution reserve. The government proposes that the fee be increased from 9 bps to 12.5 bps and the amendment is proposed to be effective from 1 January 2018. Should the proposal be implemented

<<<

 under Swedish law, it is likely to have a negative impact on the operating income of the Issuer.
RISKS RELATED TO THE NOTES
Noteholders are subject to credit risk on the Issuer
Noteholders take a credit risk on the Issuer. A Noteholder's ability

<<<

 to receive payment under the Notes is dependent on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its payment obligations, which in turn is dependent upon the financial condition and viability of the Issuer.
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are deeply

<<<

 subordinated. An investor in the Notes assumes an enhanced risk of loss in the event of the Issuer's insolvency
The Notes constitute unsecured, deeply subordinated obligations of the Issuer. In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation

<<<

 (Sw. likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) of the Issuer, the rights of the Noteholders to payments on or in respect of the Notes (which in the case of any payment of principal shall be to payment of the then Prevailing Principal Amounts

<<<

 only) shall rank:
(a) pari passu without any preference among themselves;
22

(b) at least pari passu with payments to holders of any other Additional Tier 1 Instruments and claims of any other subordinated creditors the claims of which are

<<<

 expressed to rank pari passu with the Notes;
(c) in priority to payments to holders of all classes of share capital of the Issuer in their capacity as such holders; and
(d) junior in right of payment to the payment of any present or future

<<<

 claims of (i) depositors of the Issuer, (ii) other unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer and (iii) except as expressed in (b) above, any other subordinated creditors of the Issuer.
In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation or

<<<

 bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining after these payments to pay amounts due under the Notes.
Although the Notes may pay a higher rate of interest than comparable Notes which are not subordinated or which

<<<

 are subordinated but not so deeply, there is a significant risk that an investor in the Notes will lose all or some of his investment in the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. See Condition 3 (Status

<<<

) for a description of the ranking of the Notes.
The Issuer is not prohibitedfrom issuingfurther debt, which may rank pari passu with or senior to the Notes
There is no restriction on the amount or type of debt that the Issuer may issue or incur

<<<

 that ranks senior to, or pari passu with, the Notes. The incurrence of any such debt may reduce the amount recoverable by Noteholders in the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, may limit the ability

<<<

 of the Issuer to meet its obligations in respect of the Notes and could result in Noteholders losing all or some of their investment in the Notes. In addition, the Notes do not contain any restriction on the Issuer issuing securities ranking

<<<

 pari passu with the Notes and having similar or preferential terms to the Notes.
Interest payments on the Notes may be cancelled by the Issuer (in whole or in part) at any time and, in certain circumstances, the Issuer will be required to cancel

<<<

 such interest payments
Interest on the Notes will be payable only out of the Issuer's Distributable Items, and the Issuer shall have sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment

<<<

 that would otherwise be payable on any Interest Payment Date. Interest will only be due and payable on an Interest Payment Date to the extent it is not cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Notes. If the Issuer does not make an interest

<<<

 payment on the relevant Interest Payment Date (or if the Issuer elects to make a payment of a portion, but not all, of such interest payment), such non-payment shall evidence the Issuer's exercise of its discretion to cancel such interest payment

<<<

 (or the portion of such interest payment not paid), and accordingly such interest payment (or the portion thereof not paid) shall not be due and payable.
Any cancellation of interest (in whole or in part thereof) carried out in accordance with

<<<

 Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) shall in no way limit or restrict the Issuer from making any payment of interest or equivalent payment or other distribution in connection with any instrument ranking junior to the Notes (including, without

<<<

 limitation, any CET1 capital) of the Issuer or the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation or in respect of any other Additional Tier 1 Instruments. In addition, the Issuer may without restriction use funds that could have been applied to make

<<<

 such cancelled payments to meet its other obligations as they become due.
Subject to the extent permitted in the following paragraph in respect of partial interest payments, the Issuer shall not make an interest payment on the Notes on any

<<<

 Interest Payment Date (and such interest payment shall therefore be deemed to have been cancelled and thus shall not be due and payable on such Interest Payment Date) if the Issuer has insufficient Distributable Items to make any payment of

<<<

 interest in respect of the Notes scheduled for payment in the then current financial year and any other interest payments paid and/or required and/or scheduled to be paid out of Distributable Items in such financial year in accordance with

<<<

 Capital Regulations (in each case excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in determining the Distributable Items of the Issuer). The Issuer's Distributable Items will depend to a large extent on the net income earned by

<<<

 the Issuer.
23

Although the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to make a partial interest payment on the Notes on any Interest Payment Date, it may only do so to the extent that such partial interest payment may be made without breaching

<<<

 the restriction in the preceding paragraph.
In circumstances where the Capital Buffers Act (Sw. Lag (2014:966) om kapitalbuffertar) implementing Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive (or, as the case may be, any other provision of Swedish law

<<<

 transposing or implementing such Article) applies, no payments will be made on the Notes (whether by way of principal, interest, or otherwise) if and to the extent that such payment would cause the maximum distributable amount (if any), determined

<<<

 in accordance with the Capital Buffers Act (Sw. Lag (2014:966) om kapitalbuffertar) (or, as the case may be, any other provision of Swedish law transposing or implementing such Article) then applicable to either the Issuer and/or the Landshypotek

<<<

 Consolidated Situation (as the case may be) to be exceeded. The maximum distributable amount is a novel concept, and its determination is subject to considerable uncertainty. See "CRD IV introduces capital requirements that are in addition

<<<

 to the minimum capital ratio" below.
In addition, no payment of interest will be made in respect of the Notes if and to the extent that the SFSA requires the Issuer to cancel the relevant payment (in whole or in part).
Cancelled interest shall

<<<

 not be due and shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, and Noteholders shall have no rights thereto or to receive any additional interest or compensation as a result of such cancellation. Furthermore, no cancellation of interest

<<<

 in accordance with the terms of the Notes shall constitute a default in payment or otherwise under the Notes or entitle Noteholders to take any action to cause the Issuer to be declared bankrupt or for the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution

<<<

 of the Issuer. The Issuer is entitled to cancel payments of interest in its sole discretion and it is permitted to do so even if it could make such payments without exceeding the limits described in the paragraphs above.
Any actual or anticipated

<<<

 cancellation of interest on the Notes will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation provisions of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than

<<<

 the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition.
The Notes are perpetual and have no scheduled

<<<

 redemption
The Notes have no fixed final redemption date and Noteholders have no rights to call for the redemption of the Notes. Although the Issuer may redeem the Notes in the circumstances described in Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase

<<<

), there are limitations on its ability to do so, in particular obtaining the prior permission of the SFSA and certain other limitations set out in Condition 7(g) (Conditions to Redemption, Purchase etc.). Noteholders should not invest in the

<<<

 Notes in the expectation that the Issuer will redeem the Notes should it become entitled to do so under Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase). Any decision by the Issuer as to whether it will exercise calls in respect of the Notes will be taken

<<<

 at the absolute discretion of the Issuer with regard to factors such as the economic impact of exercising such calls, the capital requirements of the Issuer and/or the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation at the relevant time and prevailing

<<<

 market conditions. The Issuer expresses no intention whether it will or will not redeem the Notes in such circumstances.
In assessing whether or not to permit a redemption or repurchase of the Notes under Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase

<<<

), the SFSA must take into account the capital position of the Issuer and the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation at such time as well as a number of other technical rules and standards relating to regulatory capital requirements applicable

<<<

 to the Issuer. It is uncertain how the SFSA will apply these criteria in practice and such rules and standards may change during the life of the Notes. It is therefore difficult to predict whether at any time, and on what terms, the SFSA will

<<<

 permit any redemption or repurchase of the Notes.
Noteholders should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time.
24

The Issuer has the right to redeem the

<<<

 Notes on any Optional Redemption Date or upon the occurrence o f a Tax Event or a Capital Event. This may limit the market value o f the Notes and an investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a manner which achieves a

<<<

 similar effective return
Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) provides that the Issuer may call the Notes on the First Call Date or on any other Optional Redemption Date at an amount equal to the then Prevailing Principal Amounts of the Notes

<<<

, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled. In addition, the Issuer may also call the Notes if a Tax Event or a Capital Event (each as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Interpretation)) occurs, also at

<<<

 an amount equal to the then Prevailing Principal Amounts of the Notes, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled. In each case, any such redemption of the Notes may only be made if the requirements of Condition

<<<

 7(g) (Conditions to Redemption, Purchase etc.) are met, in particular obtaining the prior permission of the SFSA, and subject to compliance with certain regulatory conditions set out in the Capital Regulations.
It should also be noted that

<<<

 the Issuer may redeem the Notes as described above even if (i) the Prevailing Principal Amounts of the Notes have been reduced by means of a Write-Down in accordance with the Conditions and (ii) the principal amount of the Notes has not been

<<<

 fully reinstated to the Initial Principal Amount of the Notes.
The redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally

<<<

 will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any such period.
The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes

<<<

. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate

<<<

. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
Substitution or Variation of the Notes without Noteholder consent
Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Capital Event, the Issuer

<<<

 may, at its option, subject to the requirements of Condition 7(g) (Conditions to Redemption, Purchase etc.) which includes obtaining the permission of the SFSA, but without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Noteholders, substitute

<<<

 or vary the terms of the Notes so that they remain, or become, Qualifying Securities, as provided in Condition 7(f) (Substitution or Variation instead o f Redemption) (provided that such substitution or variation does not itself give rise to

<<<

 any right of the Issuer to redeem, substitute or vary the terms pursuant to Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) in relation to the Qualifying Securities so substituted or varied).
Any such substitution or variation may have adverse consequences

<<<

 for Noteholders, dependent on a number of factors, including the nature and terms and conditions of the relevant Qualifying Securities and the tax laws to which a particular holder of the Notes is subject.
CRD IV introduces capital requirements

<<<

 that are in addition to the minimum capital ratio
Under CRD IV, institutions are required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital of 8 per cent. of risk weighted assets. In addition to these so-called "own funds" requirements under CRD

<<<

 IV, supervisory authorities may impose additional capital requirements to cover other risks (thereby increasing the regulatory minimum required under CRD IV), which could include further capital requirements such as the additional CET1 capital

<<<

 requirements imposed by the SFSA under the Swedish Pillar 2 framework. The Issuer may also decide to hold additional capital. See also the risk factor "Increased capital requirements" above.
CRD IV further imposes five new capital buffers that

<<<

 are in addition to the minimum capital requirement and are required to be satisfied with CET1 capital: (i) the capital conservation buffer, (ii) the countercyclical buffer, (iii) the global systemically important institutions buffer, (iv) the

<<<

 other systemically important institutions buffer and (v) the systemic risk buffer. Some or all of these buffers
25

may be applicable to the Issuer and/or the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation as determined by the SFSA. See also the risk

<<<

 factor "Increased capital requirements" above.
Under Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive, Member States must require that institutions that fail to meet the "combined buffer requirement" (which, as implemented in Sweden, involves for the Issuer

<<<

 the combination of the capital conservation buffer, the countercyclical buffer and the systemic risk buffer) will be subject to restricted "discretionary payments" (which are defined broadly by CRD IV as payments relating to CET1 capital, variable

<<<

 remuneration and payments on Additional Tier 1 Instruments such as the Notes). On 14 March 2016, the SFSA resolved that the countercyclical capital buffer for Sweden would be further increased and that the rate would be raised to 2 per cent

<<<

. with effect from 19 March 2017. See also the risk factor "Increased capital requirements" above.
Where any such restrictions are to apply they will be scaled according to the extent of the breach of the "combined buffer requirement" and calculated

<<<

 as a percentage of the profits of the institution since the last distribution of profits or "discretionary payment". Such calculation will result in a "maximum distributable amount" in each relevant period. As an example, the scaling is such

<<<

 that in the bottom quartile of the "combined buffer requirement", no "discretionary distributions" will be permitted to be paid. As a consequence, in the event of breach of the combined buffer requirement (including where additional capital

<<<

 requirements are imposed by the SFSA that have the result of increasing the regulatory minimum required under CRD IV) it may be necessary to reduce discretionary payments, including in respect of the Notes as required by Condition 5(c) (Interest

<<<

 Cancellation - Maximum Distributable Amount) and the potential exercise by the Issuer of its discretion to cancel (in whole or in part) interest payments in respect of the Notes.
Loss Absorptionfollowing a Trigger Event
The principal amount

<<<

 o f the Notes may be reduced to absorb losses
If at any time the CET1 ratio of the Issuer or the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation, as calculated in accordance with Capital Regulations, is less than 5.125 per cent., in the case of the Issuer

<<<

, or 7.00 per cent., in the case of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation, this shall constitute a "Trigger Event" for the purposes of the Conditions and the Notes will be utilised to absorb any losses of the Issuer and/or the Landshypotek

<<<

 Consolidated Situation. In such circumstances, the Issuer shall cancel any accrued and unpaid interest (including if payable on the Write-Down Date) and, on the Write-Down Date, reduce the then Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note by the

<<<

 relevant Write-Down Amount. Noteholders may lose all or some of their investment as a result of a Write-Down.
The Issuer and/or the SFSA may determine that a Trigger Event has occurred on more than one occasion and the then Prevailing Principal

<<<

 Amount of each Note may be reduced on more than one occasion, provided that the Prevailing Principal Amount of a Note may never be reduced to below SEK 0.01.
In addition, in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of

<<<

 the Issuer prior to the Notes being written up in full, Noteholders' claims for principal will be based on the reduced Prevailing Principal Amounts of the Notes. Further, during any period when the Prevailing Principal Amount of a Note is less

<<<

 than the Initial Principal Amount, interest will accrue on the then Prevailing Principal Amount of the Note and the Notes will be redeemable on any Optional Redemption Date or upon a Tax Event or a Capital Event at the Prevailing Principal

<<<

 Amount, which will be lower than the Initial Principal Amount.
The occurrence o f a Trigger Event is inherently unpredictable and depends on a number o ffactors, including those discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs, any o

<<<

 f which may be outside the Issuer's control
The circumstances surrounding a Trigger Event are unpredictable, and there are a number of factors that could affect the CET1 ratio.
The CET1 ratio may fluctuate. The calculation of such ratio could

<<<

 be affected by one or more factors, including, among other things, changes in the mix of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation's business, major events affecting the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation's earnings, dividend payments by the

<<<

 Issuer, regulatory changes (including changes to definitions and calculations of
26

regulatory capital ratios and their components, including CET1 capital and risk weighted assets) and the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation's ability to

<<<

 manage risk weighted assets in both its ongoing businesses and those which it may seek to exit. In addition, the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation could have capital resources and risk weighted assets denominated in foreign currencies, and

<<<

 changes in foreign exchange rates will result in changes in SEK equivalent value of foreign currency denominated capital resources and risk weighted assets. As a result, the CET1 ratio is exposed to foreign currency movements.
Due to the inherent

<<<

 uncertainty regarding whether a Trigger Event will occur, it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, a Write-Down may occur. Accordingly, the trading behaviour of the Notes is not necessarily expected to follow the trading behaviour of

<<<

 other types of security. Any indication that a Trigger Event may occur can be expected to have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.
The CET1 ratio will be affected by the Issuer's business decisions and, in making such

<<<

 decisions, the Issuer's interests may not be aligned with those o f the Noteholders
As discussed, the CET1 ratio could be affected by a number of factors. It will also depend on the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation's decisions relating to

<<<

 its businesses and operations, as well as the management of its capital position. The Issuer will have no obligation to consider the interests of the Noteholders in connection with the strategic decisions of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation

<<<

, including in respect of capital management. Noteholders will not have any claim against the Issuer or any other member of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation relating to decisions that affect the business and operations of the Landshypotek

<<<

 Consolidated Situation, including its capital position, regardless of whether they result in the occurrence of a Trigger Event. Such decisions could cause Noteholders to lose all or part of the value of their investment in the Notes.
The CET

<<<

1 ratio shall be calculated by the Issuer and shall be binding on the Noteholders
For the purposes of determining whether a Trigger Event has occurred and if a Write-Down of the Notes is required, the Issuer must (and the SFSA (or any agent

<<<

 appointed for such purpose by the SFSA) may) calculate the CET1 ratio of the Issuer or the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation, as the case may be, based on information (whether or not published) available to management of the Issuer, including

<<<

 information internally reported within the Issuer pursuant to its procedures for ensuring effective ongoing monitoring of the capital ratios of the Issuer and the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation. The Issuer will calculate and publish the

<<<

 relevant CET1 ratio on at least a quarterly basis.
The Issuer's and/or the SFSA's calculation of the CET1 ratios of the Issuer and the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation, and therefore its determination of whether a Trigger Event has occurred

<<<

, shall be binding on the Noteholders, who shall have no right to challenge the published figures detailing the CET1 ratios of the Issuer or the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation, as the case may be.
Any Write-Up o f the Notes is at the sole

<<<

 and absolute discretion of the Issuer and may require unanimous shareholder approval
Any Write-Up shall apply at the sole and absolute discretion of the Issuer. However, the Issuer's ability to Write-Up the Prevailing Principal Amount of the

<<<

 Notes is subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount (when the amount of the Write-Up is aggregated together with other distributions of the Issuer or the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation, as applicable, of the kind referred to in Article

<<<

 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (or, if different, any provision of Capital Regulations implementing Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive)) not being exceeded thereby. In addition, any such Write-Up may constitute a "transfer of value" (värdeöverföring

<<<

) for the purposes of the Swedish Companies Act which would require the unanimous approval of the shareholders of the transferor (i.e. the Issuer) at the time of the transfer. As at the date of this Prospectus, the Issuer's sole shareholder

<<<

 is Landshypotek Ekonomisk Förening (the "Parent"). No assurance can be given that the Issuer's shareholder will approve any such Write-Up at the relevant time nor that the Issuer will continue to be owned solely by the Parent.
Furthermore,

<<<

 the Issuer will not in any circumstances be obliged to write up the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes, but any Write-Up must be undertaken on a pro rata basis with the other Notes and with any other Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments

<<<

 of the Relevant Entity that have terms
27

permitting a principal write-up to occur on a similar basis to that set out in these provisions in the circumstances existing on the date of the relevant Write-Up.
The Notes may be subject to loss

<<<

 absorption on any application o f the general bail-in tool or at the point o f non-viability o f the Issuer
With regard to risks applying to Noteholders in the context of loss absorption at the point of non viability of the Issuer and resolution

<<<

 and further risks in connection with regulatory aspects concerning financial institutions in general, please see "Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive" and "Loss absorption at the point o fnon-viability o f the Issuer" above.
There are no

<<<

 events o f default in relation to the Notes
Noteholders have no ability to require the Issuer to redeem their Notes. The terms of the Notes do not, therefore, provide for any events of default. The Issuer is entitled to cancel the payment of

<<<

 any interest payments in whole or in part at any time and as further contemplated in Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) and such cancellation will not constitute any event of default or similar event or entitle Noteholders to take any related

<<<

 action against the Issuer.
Notwithstanding that the Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for redemption, Noteholders may prove or claim payment under the laws of Sweden and as further provided in Condition 10 (Bankruptcy or

<<<

 Liquidation) in the bankruptcy or liquidation of the Issuer in respect of the then Prevailing Principal Amounts of the Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that has not been cancelled. However, these are the only

<<<

 circumstances in which any such claim for payment may be made by the Noteholders.
If the Issuer exercised its right to redeem or purchase the Notes in accordance with Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) but failed to make payment of the relevant

<<<

 Prevailing Principal Amounts to redeem the Notes when due, such failure would not constitute an event of default but may entitle Noteholders to bring a claim for breach of contract against the Issuer, which, if successful, could result in damages

<<<

. Following any such failure to pay amounts in respect of the Notes when due, Noteholders may also institute proceedings with a view to having the Issuer declared bankrupt and to prove or claim in the bankruptcy of the Issuer but may only otherwise

<<<

 claim payment in respect of the Notes in the bankruptcy or liquidation of the Issuer.
Interest rate risks
The Notes will bear interest at a floating rate from and including the Issue Date. The floating rate will be payable quarterly, and will

<<<

 be set immediately prior to any Interest Period to the then prevailing STIBOR rate plus the Margin.
Noteholders should be aware that the floating rate interest income is subject to changes to the STIBOR rate and therefore cannot be anticipated

<<<

. Hence, Noteholders are not able to determine a definite yield of the Notes at the time of purchase, so that their return on investment cannot be compared with that of investments in simple fixed rate (i.e. fixed rate coupons only) instruments

<<<

.
In addition, Noteholders are exposed to reinvestment risk with respect to proceeds from coupon payments or redemptions by the Issuer. If the market yield declines, and if Noteholders want to invest such proceeds in comparable transactions

<<<

, Noteholders will only be able to reinvest such proceeds in comparable transactions at the then prevailing lower market yields.
Risks related to the Notes generally
Meetings o fNoteholders: the Conditions permit defined majorities to bind all

<<<

 Noteholders
The Conditions contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including those Noteholders who did

<<<

 not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
28

Modifications
The Agent and the Issuer may agree, subject to Condition 7(g) (Conditions to Redemption, Purchase etc.) which includes

<<<

 obtaining the permission of the SFSA, but without the consent of any of the Noteholders or Couponholders, to:
(a) certain modifications to the Agency Agreement which are not prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders; or
(b) any modification

<<<

 of the Notes (including the Conditions), the Coupons, the Deed of Covenant or the Agency Agreement which is of a formal, minor or technical nature or is made to correct a manifest error or to comply with mandatory provisions of the law.
Any

<<<

 such modification will be determined in the opinion of the Issuer and will be binding on the Noteholders and Couponholders.
The value o f the Notes could be adversely affected by a change in English or Swedish Law or administrative practice

<<<


The Conditions of the Notes are based on English law (save that the provisions of the Notes under Condition 3 (Status) are governed by the laws of Sweden) in effect as at the Issue Date. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible

<<<

 judicial decision or change to English or Swedish law or administrative practice after the Issue Date and any such change could materially adversely impact the value of the Notes.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act withholding
Whilst the Notes

<<<

 are in global form and held within Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. or Clearstream Banking S.A. (together the "ICSDs"), in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that the new reporting regime and potential withholding tax imposed

<<<

 by sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") will affect the amount of any payment received by the ICSDs (see "Taxation - Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act"). However, FATCA may affect payments made to

<<<

 custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate

<<<

 investor that is a financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment)

<<<

 with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA

<<<

 or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding

<<<

. Investors should consult their own tax adviser to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has made payment to, or to the order of, the common

<<<

 depositary for the ICSDs (as bearer of the Notes) and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the ICSDs and custodians or intermediaries. Further, foreign financial institutions in a jurisdiction

<<<

 which has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States (an "IGA") are generally not expected to be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) from payments they make.
The denominations

<<<

 o f the Notes involve integral multiples
The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum denomination of SEK 2,000,000 plus integral multiples of SEK 1,000,000 in excess thereof. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts in

<<<

 excess of SEK 2,000,000 that are not integral multiples of SEK 2,000,000. In such a case a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than SEK 2,000,000 in his account with the relevant clearing system would

<<<

 not be able to sell the remainder of such holding without first purchasing a principal amount of Notes at or in excess of SEK 2,000,000 such that its holding amounts to a denomination. Further, a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts

<<<

, holds an amount which is less than SEK 2,000,000 in his account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not
29

receive Notes in definitive form ("Definitive Notes") in respect of such holding (should Definitive Notes be

<<<

 printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of the Notes at or in excess of SEK 2,000,000 such that its holding amounts to a denomination.
If Definitive Notes are issued, holders should be aware that Definitive Notes which have a

<<<

 denomination that is not an integral multiple of SEK 2,000,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Reliance on Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
The Notes will be represented on issue by one or more Global Notes that will be deposited

<<<

 with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in each Global Note, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their

<<<

 respective direct and indirect participants will maintain records of the beneficial interests in each Global Note held through it. While the Notes are represented by a Global Note, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests

<<<

 only through the relevant clearing systems and their respective participants.
While the Notes are represented by Global Notes, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligation under the Notes by making payments through the relevant clearing

<<<

 systems. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing system and its participants to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records

<<<

 relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in any Global Note.
Holders of beneficial interests in a Global Note will not have a direct right to vote in respect of the Notes so represented. Instead, such holders will be

<<<

 permitted to act only to the extent that they are enabled by the relevant clearing system and its participants to appoint appropriate proxies.
Risks related to the market generally
The secondary market generally
The Notes constitute the first

<<<

 issue of this type of security by the Issuer and the Notes will be new securities which may not be widely distributed and for which there is currently no active trading market. If a market does develop, it may not be liquid or may become illiquid

<<<

 at a later stage. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. If the Notes are traded after their

<<<

 initial issuance, they may trade at a discount to their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and the financial condition of the Issuer.
Although applications

<<<

 have been made for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List and to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, there can be no assurances that the application will be accepted, that the Notes will be so admitted or that an active trading

<<<

 market will develop. Accordingly, there can be no assurances as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Notes.
Exchange rate risks and exchange controls
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in Swedish

<<<

 krona. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are predominantly denominated in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than Swedish krona. These include the risk

<<<

 that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to a devaluation of Swedish krona or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify

<<<

 exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to Swedish krona would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable

<<<

 on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the

<<<

 ability of the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
30

Credit ratings may not reflect all risks The Notes are expected to

<<<

 be rated BB+ by Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services Europe Limited ("S&P"). This rating may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may

<<<

 affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended, reduced or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. Any such revision, suspension, reduction or withdrawal

<<<

 could adversely affect the market value of the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer does not commit to ensure that any specific rating of the Notes will be upheld nor that any credit rating agency rating the Notes will remain the same

<<<

. In general, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under the CRA

<<<

 Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended), subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending. Such general restriction will also apply in the case

<<<

 of credit ratings issued by non-EU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and

<<<

 such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority ("ESMA") on its website in accordance

<<<

 with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication

<<<

 of the updated ESMA list. Certain information with respect to the Issuer's ratings and the credit rating agencies which have assigned such ratings is set out on the front cover of this Prospectus. European Monetary Union (EMU). In the event

<<<

 that Sweden joins the EMU while the Notes are outstanding, this could adversely affect investors. If the euro becomes the legal currency in Sweden, the Notes will be paid in euro. Furthermore, the Issuer may be allowed or required by law to

<<<

 convert the Notes, and any other outstanding securities denominated in Swedish krona, to euro and to take certain other measures. A transition to euro may be followed by an interest rate disturbance which may have an adverse effect on an investment

<<<

 in the Notes.

"Tax Event" means, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the Tax Jurisdiction, or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations

<<<

, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the Issue Date, on the occasion of the next payment due under the Notes, the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay additional amounts as provided or referred to in Condition 9 (Taxation

 the case of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation (but without taking into account for these purposes any further write-down or other loss absorption of any Similar Loss Absorbing Instruments in accordance with their terms by any amount greater

2.

Form, Denomination and Title

The Notes are in bearer form, serially numbered, in the denominations of SEK 2,000,000 and integral multiples of SEK 1,000,000 in excess thereof up to and including SEK 3,000,000, each with Coupons

 so treating such holder. No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Notes under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

3.

Status

The Notes on issue constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer

<<<

 and the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation under the CRD IV requirements.

The Notes constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer. In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation (Sw. likvidation) or bankruptcy

<<<

 (Sw. konkurs) of the Issuer, the rights of the Noteholders to payments on or in respect of the Notes (which in the case of any payment of principal shall be to payment of the then Prevailing Principal Amounts only) shall rank:

(a) pari passu

<<<

 without any preference among themselves;

(b) at least pari passu with payments to holders of any other Additional Tier 1 Instruments and claims of any other subordinated creditors the claims of which are expressed to rank pari passu with the

<<<

 Notes;

(c) in priority to payments to holders of all classes of share capital of the Issuer in their capacity as such holders; and

(d) junior in right of payment to the payment of any present or future claims of (i) depositors of the Issuer

<<<

, (ii) other unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer and (iii) except as expressed in (b) above, any other subordinated creditors of the Issuer.

The Issuer reserves the right to issue or incur other Additional Tier 1 Instruments in the future

<<<

, provided, however, that any such Additional Tier 1 Instruments may not in the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, rank ahead of the Notes.

No Noteholder who shall in the event of the liquidation

<<<

 or bankruptcy of the Issuer be indebted to it shall be entitled to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against amounts owed by the Issuer in respect of the Notes held by it.

4.

Interest

(a) Interest Payment Dates

Subject

<<<

 to Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 6 (Loss Absorption and Discretionary Reinstatement) below, the Notes bear interest on their Prevailing Principal Amounts from and including the Issue Date, payable (subject as provided below

<<<

) quarterly in arrear on 29 March, 29 June, 29 September and 29 December in each year from and including 29 June 2017 (each an "Interest Payment Date"). If any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day it

<<<

 shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day unless it would then fall into the next calendar month in which event such Interest Payment Date shall be the first preceding day that is a Business Day.

Interest shall be calculated

<<<

 on the basis of the actual number of days in the relevant period divided by 360 and otherwise in accordance with Condition 4(c) (Determination o f Rate o f Interest and Interest Amount) below.

(b) Interest Rate

The rate of interest payable

<<<

 from time to time in respect of the Notes (the "Rate of Interest") will be determined on the basis of the following provisions:

(i) on each Interest Determination Date, the Agent will determine the Screen Rate at approximately 11.00 a.m. 

<<<

(Stockholm time) on that Interest Determination Date. If the Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent (or, if the Agent is unable to make such request, the Issuer or its duly appointed agent) will request each of the Reference Banks to provide

<<<

 the Agent with the rate at which deposits in SEK are offered by it to prime banks in the Swedish interbank market for three months at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on the Interest Determination Date in question and for a Representative

<<<

 Amount;

(ii) the Rate of Interest for the relevant Interest Period shall be the relevant Screen Rate plus the Margin or, if the Screen Rate is unavailable, and at least two of the Reference Banks provide such rates, the arithmetic mean (rounded

<<<

 if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) as established by the Agent of such rates, plus the Margin; and

(iii) if fewer than two rates are provided as requested, the Rate of Interest for that Interest Period

<<<

 will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by major banks in Stockholm selected by the Agent (or, if the Agent is unable to make such selection, the Issuer or its duly appointed agent), at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on the

<<<

 first day of such Interest Period for loans in SEK to leading Swedish banks for a period of three months commencing on the first day of such Interest Period and for a Representative Amount, plus the Margin. If the Rate of Interest cannot be

<<<

 determined in accordance with the above provisions, the Rate of Interest shall be determined as at the last preceding Interest Determination Date.

(c) Determination of Rate of Interest and Interest Amount

In respect of each Interest Period

<<<

, the Agent shall at or as soon as reasonably practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on each Interest Determination Date determine the SEK amount (the "Interest Amount") payable in respect of interest on each Note for the relevant Interest

<<<

 Period. The Interest Amount shall be determined by applying the Rate of Interest to the Prevailing Principal Amount of such Note, multiplying such sum by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360 and rounding

<<<

 the resultant figure to the nearest SEK 0.01 (SEK 0.005 being rounded upwards), or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention.

(d) Publication of Rate of Interest and Interest Amount

The Agent shall cause the Rate of Interest

<<<

 and the Interest Amount for each Interest Period and the relative Interest Payment Date to be notified to the Issuer and the Paying Agents and

40

to any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are at the relevant time

<<<

 listed (by no later than the first day of each Interest Period) and to be published in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) as soon as possible after their determination, and in no event later than the second Business Day thereafter. The

<<<

 Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Period.

(e) Notifications,

<<<

 etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 4, whether by the Reference Banks (or

<<<

 any of them) or the Agent, will (in the absence of wilful default, fraud and manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Agent, the Paying Agents and all Noteholders and Couponholders and (in the absence of wilful default or fraud) no liability

<<<

 to the Issuer, or the Noteholders or the Couponholders shall attach to the Reference Banks (or any of them) or the Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by any of them of their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition

<<<

 4.

5.

Interest Cancellation

The provisions of Condition 4 (Interest) above shall be subject to this Condition 5.

(a) Cancellation o f interest

The Issuer may elect, in its sole and absolute discretion, to cancel in whole or in part any

<<<

 payment of interest which is otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date. Non-payment of any amount of interest scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date will constitute evidence of cancellation of the relevant payment

<<<

, whether or not notice of cancellation has been given by the Issuer.

(b) Restriction on interest payments

Payments of interest in respect of the Notes in any financial year of the Issuer shall be made only out of Distributable Items of the

<<<

 Issuer. To the extent that the Issuer has insufficient Distributable Items to make any payment of interest in respect of the Notes scheduled for payment in the then current financial year and any other interest payments and/or distributions

<<<

 paid and/or required and/or scheduled to be paid out of Distributable Items in such financial year in accordance with the Capital Regulations, in each case excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in determining the Distributable

<<<

 Items of the Issuer, then the Issuer will, without prejudice to the right above to cancel all such payments of interest in respect of the Notes, make partial or, as the case may be, no such payment of interest in respect of the Notes.

(c)

<<<

 Maximum Distributable Amount

No payment of interest will be made in respect of the Notes if and to the extent that such payment would cause the Maximum Distributable Amount (if any) then applicable to the Issuer and/or the Landshypotek Consolidated

<<<

 Situation to be exceeded.

(d) Competent Authority

No payment of interest will be made in respect of the Notes if and to the extent that the Competent Authority requires the Issuer to cancel the relevant payment (in whole or in part).

(e

<<<

) Interest non-cumulative

If any payment of interest (or part thereof) is cancelled in accordance with this Condition 5, then the right of the Noteholders to receive the relevant interest payment (or part thereof) in respect of that Interest

<<<

 Period will be extinguished (and shall not accumulate) and the Issuer will have no obligation to pay such interest (or part thereof)

41

or to pay any interest thereon, whether or not interest on the Notes is paid in respect of any future

<<<

 Interest Period.

(f) No default

Failure to pay such interest (or the cancelled part thereof) in accordance with this Condition 5 shall not constitute an event of default or the occurrence of any event related to the insolvency of the Issuer

<<<

 or entitle Noteholders to take any action to cause the Issuer to be declared bankrupt or for the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer.

(g) Notice o fInterest Cancellation

The Issuer shall provide notice of any cancellation

<<<

 of interest (in whole or in part) to the Noteholders and the Agent as soon as possible. If reasonably practicable, the Issuer shall provide such notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. Failure to

<<<

 provide such notice will not have any impact on the effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation or deemed cancellation of interest, or give Noteholders any rights as a result of such failure.

6.

Loss Absorption and Discretionary

<<<

 Reinstatement

(a) Write-Down

If a Trigger Event occurs at any time, the Issuer will:

(i) cancel any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Notes to (but excluding) the Write-Down Date (as defined below) in accordance with Condition

<<<

 5 (Interest Cancellation) above (including if payable on the Write-Down Date); and

(ii) on the Write-Down Date (without any requirement for the consent or approval of Noteholders), reduce the then Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note by

<<<

 the relevant Write-Down Amount (such reduction, a "Write-Down" and "Written-Down" shall be construed accordingly), pro rata with the other Notes and taking into account the write down or other loss absorption of any Similar Loss Absorbing Instruments

<<<

 and the prior write-down or other loss absorption of any Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments, provided, however, that if for any reason the Issuer is unable to effect the concurrent (or substantially concurrent) write-down or other loss absorption

<<<

 of any given Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Similar Loss Absorbing Instruments within the period required by the Competent Authority, the Notes will be Written-Down notwithstanding that the relevant Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments

<<<

 and/or Similar Loss Absorbing Instruments are not also written down or otherwise absorbing losses.

(b) Trigger Event Notice

Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Issuer shall immediately inform the Competent Authority and shall give

<<<

 a notice to the Noteholders and to the Agent, which notice, in addition to specifying that a Trigger Event has occurred, shall specify (i) the date on which the Write-Down shall occur (the "Write-Down Date"), which shall be as soon as practicable

<<<

 and in any event not later than one month following (or such other period as the Capital Regulations may require) the occurrence of the Trigger Event and (ii) if then determined, the Write-Down Amount (together, a "Trigger Event Notice"). If

<<<

 the Write-Down Amount has not been determined when the Trigger Event Notice is given, the Issuer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following such determination, notify Noteholders and the Agent of the Write-Down Amount.

Such notice

<<<

 should be given as soon as practicable following the occurrence of a Trigger Event and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days following such occurrence, although any failure by the Issuer to give any such notice to or otherwise

<<<

 to so notify Noteholders will not in any way impact on the effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any Write-Down, or give Noteholders any rights as a result of such failure.

42

(c) Trigger Event Redemption Restrictions
If a Trigger Event

<<<

 Notice has been given pursuant to this Condition 6, no notice of redemption may be given pursuant to Condition 7(b) (Issuer Call) or Condition 7(c) (Redemption upon Tax Event or Capital Event) until the Trigger Event to which such Trigger Event

<<<

 Notice relates has been cured. If any notice of redemption of the Notes is given pursuant to Condition 7(b) (Issuer Call) or Condition 7(c) (Redemption upon Tax Event or Capital Event) and prior to the relevant redemption date a Trigger Event

<<<

 occurs, the relevant redemption notice shall be automatically rescinded and shall be of no force and effect, there shall be no redemption of the Notes on such redemption date and, instead, a Write-Down shall occur as provided under this Condition

<<<

 6(c). The redemption restrictions described in this Condition 6(c) are together referred to as the "Trigger Event Redemption Restrictions".
(d) Write-Down may occur on one or more occasion; No default
A Write-Down may occur on more than one

<<<

 occasion and the Notes may be Written-Down on more than one occasion. A Write-Down will not constitute an event of default or the occurrence of any event related to the insolvency of the Issuer or entitle Noteholders to take any action to cause

<<<

 the Issuer to be declared bankrupt or for the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer.
(e) CET1 ratios
For the purposes of determining whether a Trigger Event has occurred, the Issuer will (i) calculate the CET1 ratios of the Issuer

<<<

 and the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation based on information (whether or not published) available to management of the Issuer, including information internally reported within the Issuer pursuant to its procedures for ensuring effective

<<<

 ongoing monitoring of the capital ratios of the Issuer and the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation and (ii) calculate and publish the CET1 ratios of the Issuer and the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation on at least a quarterly basis.
(f) Interest

<<<

 accrual on Prevailing Principal Amount
Following a reduction of the Prevailing Principal Amounts of the Notes as described above, interest will accrue on the reduced Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note from (and including) the relevant

<<<

 Write-Down Date, and (for the avoidance of doubt) such interest will be subject to Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) and this Condition 6.
(g) Discretionary Reinstatement
If, at any time while any Note remains Written-Down, the Relevant Entity

<<<

 records a positive Net Profit, the Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion and subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount (when the amount of the Write-Up is aggregated together with other distributions of the Issuer or the Landshypotek

<<<

 Consolidated Situation, as applicable, of the kind referred to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (or, if different, any provision of the Capital Regulations implementing Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive)) not being exceeded thereby

<<<

, increase the Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note (a "Write-Up") up to a maximum of the Initial Principal Amount, on a pro rata basis with the other Notes and with any other Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments of the Issuer (in

<<<

 the case where the Relevant Entity is the Issuer) and any Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments of any members of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation (in the case where the Relevant Entity is the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation

<<<

) that have terms permitting a principal write-up to occur on a similar basis to that set out in these provisions in the circumstances existing on the date of the relevant Write-Up, provided that the sum of:
(i) the aggregate amount of the relevant

<<<

 Write-Up on all the Notes (out of the same Relevant Profits);
(ii) the aggregate amount of any payments of interest in respect of the Notes that were paid on the basis of a Prevailing Principal Amount lower than the Initial Principal Amount

<<<

 at any time after the Reference Date;
43

(iii) the aggregate amount of the increase in principal amount of each such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instrument at the time of the relevant Write-Up (out of the same Relevant Profits); and



<<<

(iv) the aggregate amount of any interest payments or distributions in respect of each such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instrument that were calculated or paid on the basis of a prevailing principal amount that is lower than the principal

<<<

 amount it was issued with at any time after the Reference Date,

does not exceed the Maximum Write-Up Amount.

The Issuer will not reinstate the principal amount of any Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments of the Issuer or any member

<<<

 of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation that have terms permitting a write-up of such principal amount to occur on a similar basis to that set out in these provisions unless it does so on a pro rata basis with a Write-Up of the Notes.

A

<<<

 Write-Up may be made on more than one occasion in accordance with these provisions until the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes has been reinstated to the Initial Principal Amount.

Any decision by the Issuer to effect or not to effect

<<<

 any Write-Up pursuant to these provisions on any occasion shall not preclude it from effecting or not effecting any Write-Up on any other occasion pursuant to these provisions.

If the Issuer decides to Write-Up the Notes pursuant to these

<<<

 provisions, a notice (a "Write Up Notice") of such Write-Up shall be given to the Noteholders and to the Agent specifying the amount of any Write-Up (as a percentage of the Initial Principal Amount of a Note that results in a pro rata increase

<<<

 in the Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note) and the date on which such Write-Up shall take effect. Such Write-Up Notice shall be given at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Write-Up is to become effective

<<<

.

Following a Write-Up in respect of the Notes, interest will accrue on the increased Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note from (and including) the date on which the relevant Write-Up takes effect, and (for the avoidance of doubt) such

<<<

 interest will be subject to Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) and this Condition 6.

The Issuer may not effect a Write-Up in respect of the Notes (i) if a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) in circumstances where such Write

<<<

-Up, together with the pro rata reinstatement of the principal amount of any Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments of the Issuer or any member of the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation, as the case may be, would cause a Trigger Event to

<<<

 occur.

(h) No Liability o fPaying Agents

None of the Paying Agents shall have any responsibility for, or liability or obligation in respect of, any loss, claim or demand incurred as a result of or in connection with a Trigger Event or any

<<<

 consequent Write-Down and cancellation of the Notes or any claims in respect thereof, and none of the Paying Agents shall be responsible for any calculation or determination or the verification of any calculation or determination in connection

<<<

 with the foregoing.

 to the Agent for cancellation.

(e) Cancellation

All Notes purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer, then Parent or any Subsidiary of the Issuer may be surrendered for cancellation by surrendering each such Note together with all unmatured

<<<

) at any time either substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes for, or vary the terms of the Notes so that they remain or, as appropriate, become, Qualifying Securities provided that such substitution or variation does not itself give

 rise to any right of the Issuer to redeem, substitute or vary the terms pursuant to this Condition 7 in relation to the Qualifying Securities so substituted or varied.

Any such notice shall specify the relevant details of the manner in which

<<<

 such substitution or variation shall take effect and where the Noteholders can inspect or obtain copies of the new terms and conditions of the Qualifying Securities. Such substitution or variation will be effected without any cost or charge

17. Swedish Statutory Bail-in Powers
Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understanding

<<<

 between the Issuer and any Noteholder (which, for the purposes of this Condition, includes each holder of a beneficial interest in the Notes), by its acquisition of the Notes, each Noteholder acknowledges, accepts and agrees to be bound by

<<<

 the exercise of, any Bail-in Power by the Relevant Resolution Authority that may result in the write-down or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the Relevant Amounts of, or distributions on, the Notes and/or the conversion of all, or a portion

<<<

, of the Relevant Amounts of, or distributions on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of the Issuer or another person, including by means of a variation to the terms of the Notes to give effect to the exercise by

<<<

 the Relevant Resolution Authority of such Bail-in Power. Each Noteholder further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the Noteholders are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, so as to give effect to, the exercise of any Bail

<<<

-in Power by the Relevant Resolution Authority.

<<<

, other securities or other obligations in connection with the exercise of any Bail-in Power by the Relevant Resolution Authority is separate and distinct from a Write-Down following a Trigger Event although this event may occur consecutively

<<<

.
For these purposes, a "Bail-in Power" means any statutory write-down, conversion, transfer, modification, suspension or similar or related power existing from time to time under, and exercised in compliance with, any laws, regulations, rules

<<<

 or requirements relating to the resolution of credit institutions, investment firms and/or group entities in effect and applicable in Sweden, including but not limited to any such laws, regulations, rules or requirements that are implemented

<<<

 time to time and any instruments, rules and standards created thereunder, pursuant to which liabilities of the Issuer (or any affiliate of the Issuer) can be reduced, cancelled, modified and/or converted into shares or other securities or obligations

<<<

 of the Issuer or any other person.
Upon the Issuer being informed or notified by the Relevant Resolution Authority of the actual exercise of the Bail-in Power or the date from which the Bail-in Power shall be effective with respect to the Notes

<<<

, the Issuer shall notify the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) without delay. Any delay or failure by the Issuer to give such notice
50

shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the Bail-in Power nor the effects

<<<

 on the Notes described in this Condition. The exercise of the Bail-in Power by the Relevant Resolution Authority with respect to the Notes shall not constitute an event of default or the occurrence of any event related to the insolvency of

<<<

 the Issuer or entitle Noteholders to take any action to cause the Issuer to be declared bankrupt or for the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer. In such circumstances, these Conditions shall continue to apply in relation to

<<<

 the Relevant Amounts in respect of the Notes, subject to any modification of the amount of distributions payable to reflect the reduction of the Relevant Amounts, and any further modification of these Conditions that the Relevant Resolution

<<<

 Authority may decide in accordance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the resolution of credit institutions, investment firms and/or group entities in effect and applicable in Sweden. Each Noteholder also acknowledges and agrees

<<<

 that this provision is exhaustive on the matters described herein to the exclusion of any other agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the application of any Bail-in Power to the Notes.

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE ISSUER
Introduction

<<<


Landshypotek Bank AB (publ) (the "Issuer" or "Landshypotek") was incorporated in Stockholm on 3 November 1994 as a public limited liability company under Swedish law, with the business name Landshypotek AB (publ) and Swedish organisation number

<<<

 556500-2762. The incorporation was part of the re-organisation of the General Mortgage Bank (Sw. Sveriges Allmänna Hypoteksbank) ("GMB") and the county mortgage bank associations (the "mortgage associations").
GMB was formed in 1861 as part

<<<

 of a government policy to increase the supply of capital to the agricultural sector. GMB's role was to fund its owners, the associations, through the issuance of bonds and debentures. The mortgage associations in turn provided funding for agricultural

<<<

, forestry and horticultural purposes and their history goes back to 1836.
The mortgage associations were re-organised as an economic co-operative on 1 January 1995 under the name Landshypotek Ekonomisk Förening (the "Association" or "Parent

<<<

"). At the same time, the business activities formerly carried out by GMB and the mortgage associations were transferred into the Issuer.
Organisational Structure
The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated in Sweden and regulated

<<<

 under the Swedish Companies Act. In addition, the Issuer is a regulated banking company under the Swedish Act on Banking and Financing Activities (Sw. Lag (2004: 297) om bank- och fmansieringsrörelse) and is subject to the supervision of the

<<<

 Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw. Finansinspektionen) (the "SFSA"). The Issuer has been granted a licence by the SFSA to issue covered bonds in accordance with the Swedish Act (2003:1223) on Issuance of Covered Bonds (Sw. Lag (2

<<<

003:1223) om utgivning av säkerställda obligationer).
The Issuer is wholly-owned by the Association, which is an economic co-operative whose members are the Issuer's loan customers in the farming and forestry sector. At the end of 2016, the

<<<

 Association had approximately 41,000 members. The ownership structure is expected to produce a loyal ownership and customer group with a strong incentive in the performance of the Issuer.
All business operations are conducted in the Issuer

<<<

 and, except for two dormant companies, the Issuer has no subsidiaries. However, as used herein, references to the "Group" are to the Issuer and the two dormant subsidiaries. The Issuer is dependent upon the Association which is the sole owner

<<<

 of the Issuer. The Issuer is not dependent on any other entity within the Group.
Activities
The Issuer is specialised in offering financial services to Swedish agriculture and forestry with real estate property as collateral. The Issuer's core

<<<

 business is to offer mortgage loans to customers in the farming and forestry sector and to customers living on farms. The lending may also be secured by other collateral than real estate property, such as a personal guarantee, floating charge

<<<

 or with EU-support as collateral (EU loans). In 2017, the Issuer will also launch an offering of mortgage loans to homeowners in Sweden, i.e. secured with other real estate property than agricultural or forest.
In addition to the above, the

<<<

 Issuer also offers products in co-operation with other companies, such as certain insurance products (in partnership with Gjensidige Forsikring ASA Norge, Svensk Filial) and certain finance products (in partnership with DNB Bank ASA, Filial

<<<

 Sverige).
Since 2014, the Issuer has also offered saving products through a digital service to the general public in Sweden.
The Issuer mainly uses the capital market as its funding source and achieves the desired flexibility by offering a

<<<

 variety of borrowing instruments that attract different types of investors. The main funding source is by issuing covered bonds.
55

Accounting principles

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the International

<<<

 Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and interpretations of the above as published by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC") as adopted by the EU. Furthermore, the SFSA's regulations and general guidelines

<<<

 for annual reports in credit institutions and securities companies (FFFS 2008:25, including amendments), the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies ("ARKL") and the recommendations of the Swedish Financial

<<<

 Reporting Board, RFR 1, Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups are also applied.

The Issuer applies statutory IFRS, which means that the legal entity's financial statements must apply all of the IFRSs and statements adopted by the EU, in

<<<

 so far as this is possible within the framework of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, the Swedish Pension Obligations Vesting Act and after taking into account the relationship between accounting and taxation. Permissible exceptions and supplements

<<<

 to IFRS are stated in the Swedish Financial Reporting Board's recommendation RFR 2, Accounting for Legal Entities, and ARKL as well as the SFSA's regulations and general guidelines for annual reports in credit institutions and securities companies

<<<

 (FFFS 2008:25). The main differences in accounting policies between the Group and the Issuer are described on pages 49-53 of the 2016 Annual Report, where a more detailed description of the accounting policies in general also can be found.

<<<



2016 Annual Report

Unless stated otherwise, the financial information relating to 2016 in this section "Information Relating to the Issuer" is based on the 2016 Annual Report, which is the most recently published annual report of the Issuer

<<<

.

Liquidity

The Issuer has a substantial liquidity portfolio of interest-bearing securities, valued at SEK 12,615 million at 31 December 2016. The Issuer's liquidity portfolio comprises liquid, interest-bearing securities, primarily Swedish

<<<

 covered bonds with the highest credit rating and bonds issued by Swedish municipalities. At 31 December 2016, the liquidity portfolio was 1.4 times larger than refinancing requirements for the next six months. The ratio is affected by the allocation

<<<

 of maturing debt for longer than six months and can, therefore, change between measurement periods.

Lending

At 31 December 2016, the Issuer's lending to the public amounted to SEK 66,518 million (SEK 64,501 million, at 31 December 2015).

<<<

 All lending is domestic and made in Swedish krona.

Loan losses and provisions

As at 31 December 2016, net loan losses for the Group totalled SEK 14.8 million (SEK 45.9 million, at 31 December 2015). The Issuer has continued to focus its work

<<<

 on the credit portfolio, thereby enabling earlier identification of companies with weak profitability and low liquidity. The losses pertain to a few individual commitments.

The table below shows the loan loss level as a percentage for the

 commercial paper programme. The Issuer is also active in the repo- and deposit markets for short term liquidity needs on a regular basis.
Long-term funding
The Issuer issues its long-term non-covered debt through a Euro Medium Term Note and

<<<

 S.O. Bond Programme (the "EMTN and S.O. Bond Programme") and may also issue on a stand-alone basis or under additional programmes from time to time. The Issuer's covered bond funding is made either through the EMTN and S.O. Bond Programme or

<<<

 through its Swedish MTN-programme and may also be made on a stand-alone basis or under additional programmes from time to time.
Competitors
The Issuer's main competitors are the savings banks and the commercial banks, which have shown an increasing

<<<

 interest in expanding their agricultural and forestry customer bases.
Capital Situation
Capital Requirements
At 31 December 2016, the total capital ratio for the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation (as defined in the Conditions) under the Basel

<<<

 III approach was 39.9 per cent. (26.1 per cent., at 31 December 2015). Own funds for the Landshypotek Consolidated Situation amounted to SEK 6,455 million and the own funds requirement was SEK 1,295 million. The capital quotient under the transitional

 rules related to the Basel I requirements was 1.51.

As referred to below under "Recent Developments", the Issuer has applied for a permission to use an internal ratings based (IRB) approach for exposures to corporates

<<<

. In light of this, among other things, the SFSA has, as of 31 December 2016, assessed the Issuer's common equity tier 1 capital requirements to be 20.8 per cent. (including Pillar 2) of the risk exposure amount and the Issuer's total common

<<<

 equity tier 1 capital to be 29.4 per cent. of the risk exposure amount.
Recent Developments
In 2016, the Issuer changed its organisation to better meet more customers and varying customer needs in both the retail and corporate sector. The changes

<<<

 include the creation of separate internal market departments for retail and corporate customers. A new operations department was also created.
In 2017, customers will be able to apply for mortgage loans for houses from the Issuer. The Issuer

<<<

 is targeting a market outside the major cities and offering brand new lending possibilities.
As disclosed in a press release dated 29 March 2016, the Issuer has decided to change its exposure classes and to apply for a permission to use an

<<<

 IRB model for exposures to corporates, in addition to its existing IRB model for retail exposures. This is to better reflect the market developments for lending to agricultural and forestry customers as well as new regulations. As a result

<<<

 of structural developments, some farmers now conduct their business in larger enterprises. In light of such structural developments, regulatory changes and following a dialogue with the SFSA, the Issuer decided to change its customer classification

<<<

. Swedish farmers conducting businesses as sole traders but with large enterprises will be reclassified and treated as corporates (rather than retail customers) from a regulatory capital perspective. This change means that the Issuer will be

<<<

 subject to an increased regulatory capital requirement. On 30 September 2016, the Issuer thus submitted an application to the SFSA for a new IRB-f model for calculating capital adequacy for corporate exposures, and consequently also applied

<<<

 for certain changes to the existing IRB model for retail exposures.
57

During 2016 the Issuer has worked systematically on continuing to strengthen its risk awareness and credit activities, including changes of the organisation and improved

<<<

 systematics, including the dialogue with customers experiencing financial difficulties. The Issuer has also maintained a continued focus on governance and control of its internal processes, for reasons including the SFSA's ongoing inspections

<<<

 of Swedish credit institutions. The SFSA's inspections include an examination of the Issuer's internal methods for measuring credit risk (IRB approach) and credit processes.

TAXATION
Swedish Taxation
The following summary outlines certain Swedish tax consequences o f the acquisition, ownership and disposal o f the Notes. The summary is based on the laws o f Sweden as currently in effect and is intended to

<<<

 provide general information only. The summary is not exhaustive and does thus not address all potential aspects o f Swedish taxation that may be relevantfor a potential investor in the Notes and is neither intended to be nor should be construed

<<<

 as legal or tax advice. In particular, the summary does not address the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers o f interest. Specific tax consequences may be applicable to certain categories o f corporations, e.g. investment

<<<

 companies and life insurance companies. Specific tax consequences may also apply when Notes are held by partnerships and as trading assets in a business. Such tax consequences are not described below. Neither does the summary cover Notes which

<<<

 are placed on an investment savings account (Sw. Investeringssparkonto). Investors should consult their professional tax advisors regarding the Swedish and foreign tax consequences (including the applicability and effect o f tax treaties) o

<<<

 f acquiring, owning and disposing o f the Notes in their particular situation.
Non-resident holders o fNotes
As used herein, a non-resident holder means a holder of Notes who is (a) an individual who is not a resident of Sweden for tax purposes

<<<

 and who has no connection to Sweden other than his/her investment in the Notes, or (b) an entity not organised under the laws of Sweden.
Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes

<<<

 to a non-resident holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax provided that such holder does not carry out business activities from a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are effectively connected. Under

<<<

 Swedish tax law, no withholding tax is imposed on payments of principal or interest to a non-resident holder of Notes.
Individuals who are not resident in Sweden for tax purposes may be liable to capital gains taxation in Sweden upon disposal

<<<

 or redemption of certain financial instruments, depending on the classification of the particular financial instrument for Swedish income tax purposes, if they have been resident in Sweden or have lived permanently in Sweden at any time during

<<<

 the calendar year of disposal or redemption or the ten calendar years preceding the year of disposal or redemption. Taxation may, however, be limited by an applicable tax treaty.
Resident holders ofNotes
As used herein, a resident holder means

<<<

 a holder of Notes who is (a) an individual who is a resident in Sweden for tax purposes or (b) an entity organised under the laws of Sweden.
Generally, for Swedish corporations and individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) that are

<<<

 resident holders of Notes, all capital income (e.g. income that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on the Notes) will be taxable. A capital gain or capital loss is calculated as the difference between the

<<<

 sales proceeds, after deduction for sales expenses, and the acquisition cost for tax purposes. The acquisition cost for all Notes of the same kind is determined according to the "average method" (Sw. genomsnittsmetoden).
An individual's capital

<<<

 income such as capital gains and interest is subject to a 30 per cent. tax rate. Limited liability companies and other legal entities are taxed on all income, including capital gains and interest, as business income at the tax rate of 22 per

<<<

 cent.
Losses on listed Notes (Sw. marknadsnoterade fordringsrätter) should generally be fully deductible for limited liability companies and for individuals in the capital income category. Certain deduction limitations may apply for individuals

<<<

 and limited liability companies with respect to losses on financial instruments deemed share equivalents (Sw. delägarrätter) for Swedish tax purposes, not described further herein.
Under Swedish tax law, no withholding tax is imposed on payments

<<<

 of principal or interest to a resident holder of Notes. However, if amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) that is a resident holder
61



<<<

of Notes, Swedish preliminary taxes (Sw. preliminarskatt) are normally withheld at a rate of 30 per cent.
The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal

<<<

") for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax ("FTT") in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States").
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope

<<<

 and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under the Commission's Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside

<<<

 of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution

<<<

 may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which

<<<

 is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
The European Commission were expected to present draft legislation for consideration by the participating Member States by the end of 2016, but this has not yet been provided

<<<

. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.
Prospective

<<<

 holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") (or any regulations thereunder

<<<

 or official interpretations thereof), an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the Code or an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof (or any law implementing

<<<

 such an intergovernmental agreement thereto) ("FATCA") impose a reporting regime and potentially a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to certain payments to (i) any non-U.S. financial institution (a "foreign financial institution", or

<<<

 "FFI" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a "Participating FFI" by entering into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to provide the IRS with certain information in respect of its account holders and investors

<<<

 and is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA and (ii) any investor (unless otherwise exempt from FATCA) that does not provide information sufficient to determine whether the investor is a U.S. person or should otherwise

<<<

 be treated as holding a "United States Account" of the Issuer (a "Recalcitrant Holder"). The Issuer is classified as an FFI.
In general, the withholding applies currently to certain payments from sources within the United States and will apply

<<<

 to certain payments from sources outside the United States (more specifically, "foreign passthru payments" (a term not yet defined)) no earlier than 1 January 2019. This withholding would not apply to payments in respect of non-U.S. obligations

<<<

 characterised as debt for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or prior to the "grandfathering date", which is the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment

<<<

 are published, and which obligations are not materially modified after such date. Obligations characterised as equity or which do not have a fixed term for U.S. federal tax purposes are not eligible for grandfathering. The Notes are not expected

<<<

 to be eligible for grandfathered status.
The United States and a number of other jurisdictions have entered into intergovernmental agreements to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (each, an "IGA"). The United States and Sweden have entered

<<<

 into such an agreement (the "U.S.-Sweden IGA") based on the Model 1 IGA. Under the U.S.Sweden IGA, an FFI in Sweden would not be subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives, unless the FFI is specifically identified by the

<<<

 IRS as not in compliance with the requirements of the U.S.-Sweden IGA and any implementing Swedish legislation. An FFI subject to the US-Sweden
62

IGA is required to report certain information in respect of its account holders and investors

<<<

 to the Swedish Tax Authority but currently is not required to withhold under FATCA (any such withholding being "FATCA Withholding") from payments it makes (unless it has separately agreed to do so in respect of certain U.S. source income).

<<<

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurances that the Issuer or financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made will not be required to withhold under FATCA if (i) any FFI through or to which payments on such

<<<

 Notes are made is not a Participating FFI, an FFI in an IGA jurisdiction, or otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA or (ii) an investor is a Recalcitrant Holder. If an amount in respect of FATCA Withholding were to be deducted

<<<

 or withheld from interest, principal or other payments made in respect of the Notes, neither the Issuer nor any paying agent nor any other person would, pursuant to the conditions of the Notes, be required to pay additional amounts as a result

<<<

 of the deduction or withholding. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected. Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within the ICSDs, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments

<<<

 made under, or in respect of, the Notes by the Issuer, any paying agent and the common depositary, given that each of the entities in the payment chain between the Issuer and the participants in the ICSDs is a major financial institution whose

<<<

 business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Notes. The documentation expressly contemplates the possibility that the Notes may go into definitive form

<<<

 and therefore that they may be taken out of the ICSDs. If this were to happen, a nonFATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. However, Definitive Notes will only be printed in remote circumstances. FATCA is particularly

<<<

 complex. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and the U.S.-Sweden IGA, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form. Prospective investors should consult their tax

<<<

 advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to payments they may receive in connection with the Notes.
