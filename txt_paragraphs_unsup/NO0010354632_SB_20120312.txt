INTRODUCTION

<<<

 Ltd. (the "Company") is the issuer and borrower.

All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Loan (the "Loan Agreement") between the Company and the Loan Trustee

<<<

 dated 9 Februaiy 2007, as amended on 23 July 2010, 23 August 2010 and 9 March 2012.

BACKGROUND

In recent years, the Company has experienced certain operational challenges which have materially impacted its profitability and cash flow. These operational challenges include an arbitration concerning

<<<

 the termination of the charter contract between Puffin FPSO Ltd and AED Services Ltd, which arbitration ruled in Puffin FPSO Ltd's favour in August 2011.

Given the above background, the Company is proposing to amend the terms of the Loan Agreement

<<<

 and, to this end, has been in discussions with an informal ad-hoc committee of bondholders holding 93.85% of the principal amount of the outstanding Bonds (collectively, the "Committee"). The Company has informed the Loan Trustee that the members

<<<

 of the Committee have entered into voting agreements with the Company agreeing to vote their Bonds in favour of the Proposal as set forth in paragraph 3 (Proposal) below and Schedule 1 {Amended and Restated Loan Agreement), provided however

<<<

 that the Proposal and Loan Agreement may be subject to any further changes that are agreed between the Company, the Loan Trustee and the Committee (or its legal advisors).

In general terms, the Company seeks to amend the terms of the Loan

<<<

 Agreement for the main purpose of the postponement of the Maturity Date until 14 February 2014 and to provide the Company with the option under certain circumstances to pay its interest in kind through the issue of additional Bonds.

In return

<<<

, the Bondholders shall be compensated with (among other things):

· a partial redemption of the Loan at par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount) in the minimum amount of USD 36,000,000;

· an increase in the cash interest rate on the Bonds to LIBOR plus 10.00% per annum, provided that

<<<

<<<

 basis in an amount equivalent to: (a) the amount of interest that would have accrued on that portion of the Remaining Loan to which the unpaid accrued interest relates since the last Interest Payment Date if the interest rate during that period

<<<

 had been LIBOR plus 13,00% per annum; plus (b) that portion of unpaid accrued interest;
· a cash sweep mechanism on each Interest Payment Date for amounts in excess of USD 2,500,000 to be applied in redemption of the Loan at a price equal to

<<<

 101% of par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount), subject to a minimum redemption level of USD 200,000;
· additional requirements for mandatory pre-payment upon the occurrence of certain additional events, including: (i) a change

<<<

 of control of the Company; and (ii) the date falling six months from the date on which a definitive time charter or other written contract relating to the hire or use of the vessel FPSO Front Puffin is entered into;
· amortizing principal payments

<<<

 of USD 5,000,000 at 101% of par value on each of 14 February 2013 and 14 August 2013; and
· the granting of additional security in favour of the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), in a form reasonably acceptable to the Loan Trustee

<<<

, including: (i) a first priority deed of covenants supplemental to a first priority mortgage over the vessel FPSO Crystal Ocean; (ii) a first priority assignment of earnings payable to the member of the Group owning the relevant Vessel in respect

<<<

 of all contracts for hire or employment of the Vessel from time to time; (iii) a first priority assignment of, or charge over, any monetary claims (whether in the nature of loans or balances) which any member of the Group has from time to time

<<<

 against any other member of the Group (and in respect of which such member of the Group is lender or creditor); (iv) an agreement to be entered into between each member of the Group and the Loan Trustee pursuant to which each member of the

<<<

 Group will agree that any balances owed by such member of the Group will be subordinated to the claims of the Bondholders, and providing the Loan Trustee with the power, following an Event of Default, to release or otherwise deal with such

<<<

 balances as it may deem necessary in the interests of the Bondholders; and (v) the replacement of, or supplement to, existing guarantees provided by each of the Guarantors with new unconditional guarantees provided by each of the Guarantors

<<<

 which are subject to either English law or the law of the jurisdiction in which the respective Guarantor is incorporated (as the Loan Trustee determines in its discretion).
