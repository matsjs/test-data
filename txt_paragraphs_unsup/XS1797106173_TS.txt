IMPORTANT NOTICES

P I Rules - Prohibition on m arketing and sales to retail investors

The Notes discussed in this Prospectus are complex financial instruments and are not a

<<<

 suitable or appropriate investment for all investors. In some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws, regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the Notes to retail investors

<<<

. In particular, in June 2015, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") published the Product Intervention (Contingent Convertible Instruments and Mutual Society Shares) Instrument 2015, which took effect from 1 October 20

<<<

15 (the "PI Rules").

In addition, (i) on 1 January 2018, the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged and retail and insurance-based investments products (the ''PRIIPs Regulation") became directly

<<<

 applicable in all EEA member states and (ii) MiFID II were required to be implemented in EEA member states by 3 January 2018. Together, the PI Rules, the PRIIPs Regulation and MiFID II are referred to as the "Regulations".

The Regulations

<<<

 set out various obligations in relation to (i) the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and (ii) the offering, sale and distribution of packaged retail and insurance-based investment products and certain contingent write

<<<

 down or convertible securities, such as the Notes.

Potential investors should inform themselves of, and comply with, any applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance with respect to any resale of the Notes (or any beneficial interests

<<<

 therein), including the Regulations.

The Joint Lead Managers (as defined below) are required to comply with some or all of the Regulations. By purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase any Notes (or a beneficial interest in such

<<<

 Notes) from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers, each prospective investor represents, warrants, agrees with and undertakes to the Issuer and each of the Joint Lead Managers that:

1.

it is not a retail client (as defined in MiFID II

<<<

);

2.

whether or not it is subject to the Regulations, it will not:

(a)

sell or offer the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) to retail clients (as defined in

MiFID II);

(b)

communicate (including the distribution of this Prospectus

<<<

) or approve an invitation or

inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite the Notes (or any beneficial interests

therein) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a

way that it is likely to be received

<<<

 by a retail client (as defined in MiFID II). In selling or

offering Notes or making or approving communications relating to the Notes, it may not

rely on the limited exemptions set out in the PI Rules; and

3.

it will at all times comply

<<<

 with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether

inside or outside the EEA) relating to the promotion, offering, distribution and/or sale of the Notes

(or any beneficial interests therein), including (without limitation

<<<

) MiFID II and any other

applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance relating to determining the appropriateness

and/or suitability of an investment in the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) by investors in

any relevant

<<<

 jurisdiction.

PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors - The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor

<<<

 in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended),

<<<

 where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making

<<<

 them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

- 1-

MiFID II product

<<<

 governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target m arket - Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target

<<<

 market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person

<<<

 subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target

<<<

 market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Suitability of Investment

The Notes are complex financial instruments

<<<

 that involve a high degree of risk. Sophisticated institutional investors generally purchase complex financial instruments as part of a wider financial structure rather than as standalone investments. They purchase complex financial instruments

<<<

 as a way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless it has the expertise (either alone or with a financial

<<<

 adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment portfolio.

Each potential investor

<<<

 in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each investor should:

(i)

have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits


<<<


and the risks of investing the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in

this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;

(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context

<<<

 of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;

(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in

<<<

 the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency;

(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes, such as the provisions governing Write Downs and the situations

<<<

 in which interest payments may be cancelled or deemed cancelled, and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and

(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial advisor) possible

<<<

 scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

General

The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Prospectus. To the best of

<<<

 the knowledge of the Issuer, having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case, the information contained in this Prospectus is in accordance with the facts and contains no omission likely to affect its import.

The Issuer has

<<<

 confirmed to BNP Paribas (the "Structuring Adviser") and the Joint Lead Managers named under "Subscription and Sale" below (the "Joint Lead M anagers") that this Prospectus contains all information regarding the Issuer and the Notes which is

<<<

 (in the context of the issue, offering and sale of the Notes) material; such information is true and accurate in all material respects and is not misleading in any material respect; any opinions, predictions or intentions expressed in this

<<<

 Prospectus on the part of the Issuer are honestly held or made and are not misleading in any material respect; this Prospectus does not omit to state any material fact necessary to make such information, opinions, predictions or intentions

<<<

 (in such context) not misleading in any material respect; and all proper enquiries have been made to ascertain and to verify the foregoing.

No person has been authorised to give any information or to make any representation other than those

<<<

 contained in this document in connection with the offering of the Notes and, if given or made, such

- 2-

information or representations must not be relied upon as having been authorised by the Issuer, the Structuring Adviser or the Joint

<<<

 Lead Managers. Neither the delivery of this Prospectus nor the offering, sale or delivery of any Note made hereunder shall, under any circumstances, constitute a representation or create any implication that there has been no adverse change

<<<

, or any event reasonably likely to involve any adverse change, in the affairs of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries (the "Issuer's Group") since the date hereof. This Prospectus does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation by, or on behalf

<<<

 of, the Issuer, the Trustee (as defined herein), the Structuring Adviser or the Joint Lead Managers to subscribe for, or purchase, any of the Notes. This Prospectus does not constitute an offer, and may not be used for the purpose of an offer

<<<

 to, or a solicitation by, anyone in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorised or is unlawful.
The Structuring Adviser, the Joint Lead Managers and Citicorp Trustee Company Limited (the

<<<

 "Trustee") have not separately verified the information contained herein. Accordingly, no representation, warranty or undertaking, express or implied, is made and no responsibility or duty (whether fiduciary, in tort or otherwise) or liability

<<<

 is accepted by the Structuring Adviser, the Joint Lead Managers, the Trustee or any of them as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this Prospectus or any other information provided by the Issuer in connection with

<<<

 the Notes or their distribution.
This Prospectus is not intended to provide the basis of any credit or other evaluation and should not be considered as a recommendation by the Issuer, the Structuring Adviser, the Joint Lead Managers or the

<<<

 Trustee that any recipient of this Prospectus should purchase any of the Notes. Each investor contemplating purchasing Notes should make its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs, and its own appraisal of the

<<<

 creditworthiness, of the Issuer.
The distribution of this Prospectus and the offering, sale and delivery of Notes in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. Persons into whose possession this Prospectus comes are required by the Issuer

<<<

 and the Joint Lead Managers to inform themselves about and to observe any such restrictions. For a description of certain restrictions on offers, sales and deliveries of Notes and on distribution of this Prospectus and other offering material

<<<

 relating to the Notes, see "Subscription and Sale".
In particular, the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and are subject to United States tax law requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, Notes may not

<<<

 be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to U.S. persons.
Copies of this Prospectus, including any supplements thereto (if any), are available, free of charge, at the Issuer's registered office at Barks väg 15, SE - 106 80

<<<

, Stockholm, Sweden.
Certain Definitions and Presentation of Information
In this Prospectus, unless otherwise specified, references to a "Member State" are references to a Member State of the European Economic Area, references to "EUR", "euro

<<<

" and "" are to the currency introduced at the start of the third stage of European economic and monetary union pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as amended, references to "SEK" are to Swedish Krona, the lawful

<<<

 currency of the Kingdom of Sweden and references to "DKK" are to Danish Krone, the lawful currency of Denmark.
Certain industry terms are used in this Prospectus to describe the Issuer's business and the industry in which it operates. For a

<<<

 further explanation as to certain terms used, please refer to "Glossary o f Terms" on page 86 of this Prospectus.
Certain total figures provided in tables and statements in the section entitled "Description o f the Issuer, the Issuer's Group

<<<

 and the Sampo Group" may not always reconcile due to rounding. The presentation of these figures is to ensure that each line item corresponds to the relevant source and therefore rounding differences may arise in totals.
Forward Looking Statements

<<<


This Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements. The words "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "plan", "intend", "targets", "aims", "estimate", "project", "will", "would", "may", "could", "continue" and similar expressions are intended

<<<

 to identify forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Prospectus, including, without limitation, those regarding the financial position, business strategy, management plans and objectives

<<<

 for future operations of the Issuer,
- 3-

the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be) are forward looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors

<<<

, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These forward looking statements are based on numerous assumptions

<<<

 regarding our present and future business strategies and the environment in which we expect to operate in the future.
Factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially include, but are not limited to

<<<

, those discussed under "Risk Factors". Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Issuer speak only as at the date they are made. The Issuer does not undertake to update forward looking statements to reflect any changes in their

<<<

 expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.
Alternative Performance Measures ("APMs")
This Prospectus includes certain financial metrics which the Issuer considers

<<<

 to constitute APMs and which are provided in addition to the financial performance measures established by the International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), the Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies (Sw. Lag om årsredovisning

<<<

 i försäkringsföretag) (ARFL), the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and general recommendations on annual accounts in insurance companies (FFFS 2015:12) and the Swedish Insurance Business Act (Sw. Försäkringsrörelselagen

<<<

) (FRL) (together the "applicable accounting standards"). The Issuer believes the APMs provide investors with meaningful, additional insight as to underlying performance of the Issuer. An investor should not consider financial measures outside

<<<

 of the applicable accounting standards as alternatives to measures reflected in the financial information incorporated by reference herein, which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS. In particular, an investor should not consider such

<<<

 measures as alternatives to profit after tax, operating profit or any other performance measures derived in accordance with applicable accounting standards or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Issuer

<<<

's activity. The Issuer's financial measures outside of the applicable accounting standards may not be comparable with similarly titled financial measures reported by other companies.
In order to facilitate increased comparability, comments

<<<

 on changes in amounts and percentages between the current year and the preceding year are occasionally adjusted for the impact of changes in exchange rates, whereby amounts in foreign currency have been recalculated using the same exchange

<<<

 rates for the particular years.
For further explanation as to certain terms used in connection with the Description of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and the Sampo Group, please refer to "Glossary o f Terms" on page 86 of this Prospectus.
The

<<<

 Solvency II Group
As of the date of this Prospectus, the Solvency II Group is constituted by the Sampo Group, a group which is engaged in non-life insurance, life insurance and banking. As of the date of this Prospectus, events which may give

<<<

 rise to a Capital Disqualification Event, a Regulatory Deficiency Event or a Trigger Event apply in relation to the Solvency II Group only, which is a larger group than the Issuer or the Issuer's Group. Therefore, the level of own funds, Solvency

<<<

 Capital Requirement and Minimum Capital Requirement of the Solvency II Group is dependent upon the performance and capital requirements of several other companies (including Sampo plc) and not just the Issuer or the Issuer's Group. Currently

<<<

, the Issuer and the Issuer's Group are not subject to direct supervision by a national regulatory authority for Solvency II purposes. In the event of any change in the regulatory oversight of the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group, which results

<<<

 in direct supervision of the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group for Solvency II purposes (whether on a solo, group or consolidated basis), the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group may be required to raise further capital in order to maintain the

<<<

 then applicable Minimum Capital Requirement and Solvency Capital Requirement. See "Risk Factors --Risks relating to the structure o f the Notes - Regulatory oversight and application o f Minimum Capital Requirements and Solvency Capital Requirements

<<<

 to the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency II Group" and "Regulation --Supervision" for further details.

RISK FACTORS
Any investment in the Notes is subject to a number o f risks. Prior to investing in the Notes, prospective

<<<

 investors should carefully consider riskfactors associated with any investment in the Notes, the business o f the Issuer and the industry in which it operates together with all other information contained in this Prospectus, including, in particular

<<<

 the risk factors described below. Words and expressions defined in the Conditions or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same meanings in this section.
The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent

<<<

 in investing in the Notes. Additional risks and uncertainties relating to the Issuer that are not currently known to the Issuer, or that it currently deems immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 the business, prospects, results o f operations and/or financial position o f the Issuer and, i f any such risk should occur, the price o f the Notes may decline and investors could lose all or part o f their investment. Investors should consider

<<<

 carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable fo r them in light o f the information in this Prospectus and their personal circumstances.
Capitalised terms which are defined in the Conditions have the same meaning when used herein

<<<

.
Risks relating to the Issuer
The Issuer is a holding company and is dependent upon its subsidiaries
The Issuer is a holding company and carries out its business through its subsidiaries (together with the Issuer, the "If Group" or "If"). Accordingly

<<<

, the Issuer is dependent upon receipt of funds from other members of the If Group in order to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes. Accordingly, material adverse events affecting the If Group's business and financial

<<<

 conditions may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.
The I f Group is impacted by macro economic development and changes in general economic conditions
Macro economic development in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and the Baltic

<<<

 countries may impact on the If Group's business, as Underwriting volumes and Underwriting risks are affected by for instance, GDP growth, new car sales volumes, employment and unexpected changes in inflation rate. In some insurance segments

<<<

, such as business interruption and cargo, the insured volume is dependent upon factors such as turnover or the amount of transported goods. Thus, a general decrease in corporate turnover or in the amount of transported goods, following a fall

<<<

 in GDP or a slowing in GDP growth, will have an adverse effect on the If Group's insurance premium volumes. Similarly, fewer new car sales have a negative effect on premium volumes in the motor segment, whereas premium income related to workers

<<<

' compensation is impacted by employment rates. In addition, in the event of unexpected changes in the inflation rate, the business and financial performance and results of operations of the If Group could be adversely affected due to deviations

<<<

 in cost of claims from expected levels.
Over the last couple of years, the If Group has operated in an environment of significant volatility in global capital and equity markets, oil prices and liquidity, and widespread economic uncertainty

<<<

. Government interest rates remain at historically low levels. Although the If Group has a diversified investment portfolio and constantly monitors and manages the composition of its investments in relation to the characteristics of its insurance

<<<

 liabilities, fluctuations in the financial markets, such as the fixed income, equity and currency markets, could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This may, in turn

<<<

, adversely impact the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.
Competitive conditions affect the I f Group's results
The If Group conducts insurance operations in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and

<<<

 the Baltic countries. The five largest insurers (of which the If Group is the largest) comprise more than half of the Nordic property and casualty ("P&C") insurance market (measured by gross written premiums) and four of the five largest insurers

<<<

 are established in more than one Nordic country. Competition in the Nordic insurance market has been intense in recent years. The market has seen leading foreign insurers establishing themselves primarily within the industrial sector, along

<<<

 with banks expanding their P&C insurance product range. Competitive pressure has also come from new sources such as smaller competitors and competition from new distribution channels such as web-based service models. Increased competition from

<<<

 such insurers could lead to a reduction in market share, which may have a material adverse effect on the If
- 5-

Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

<<<


The I f Group is subject to insurance risk
Insurance risk is the risk that the cost of future and outstanding insurance claims will be higher than anticipated due to inadequate pricing, risk concentration, incorrect assumptions or random fluctuations

<<<

 in the frequency and/or size of claims. The If Group's insurance operations are exposed to the risk of unexpected changes in the frequency and severity of claims and timing in claims payments. The extent of this risk is largely dependent on

<<<

 the type of product and business. For example, the casualty business is exposed to medical and healthcare costs as well as legislative changes in respect of injury compensation, whilst property and motor hull insurance is sensitive to building

<<<

 cost inflation and prices of spare parts and repair cost. Claim frequency can fluctuate heavily over time. High economic activity usually correlates with a higher number of claims, while restrictions in terms and conditions and changes in legislation

<<<

 may serve to increase or decrease claims frequencies. Winter weather and cold periods traditionally increase the number of property and motor claims, whereas changes in interest rates might impact the value of discounted reserves (mainly annuities

<<<

 in the If Group's IFRS accounts) and thus have an effect on the financial result.
Changes in interest rates further affect the value of Technical Provisions and own funds in the regulatory solvency calculations for Solvency II. Under Solvency

<<<

 II, all balance sheet items are measured at fair value. The market value of Technical Provisions is equal to the sum of a best estimate and a risk margin. The best estimate is derived by discounting the undiscounted best estimate of the premium

<<<

 and claims provisions and the risk margin is calculated with a cost of capital method. The undiscounted best estimate of premium provisions is computed as the expected future cash flows arising from future claims events, expenses and premiums

<<<

 covered by existing insurance obligations. For claims provisions, a cash flow profile of the estimated future payments by relevant homogeneous risk groups is estimated using actuarial reserving methods, taking all relevant cash inflows and

<<<

 outflows into account. Discounting of the cash flows is performed using discount curves that are derived consistently with the principles for the risk-free interest rate curve under Solvency II. Consequently, when market interest rates decrease

<<<

, the Technical Provisions in the Solvency II balance sheet increase and own funds decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on the If Group's financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes. Conversely

<<<

, when market interest rates increase, the Technical Provisions in the Solvency II balance sheet decrease and own funds increase.
Insurance risk can be divided into Underwriting risk, provision risk, emerging risk, catastrophe risk and Reinsurance

<<<

 risk:
Underwriting risk
Underwriting risk is the risk of losses due to inadequate pricing of insurance contracts. The If Group's pricing models generally build on statistical evaluations and actuarial methods. Should the pricing models incorporate

<<<

 inaccurate methods (for example due to poor or incorrect data) and / or the pricing process fail to capture unexpected developments in claims costs, this could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the If Group. This may, in turn

<<<

, adversely impact the value of the Notes.
Provision risk
Provision risk is the risk of loss due to the Technical Provisions not being sufficient to cover the cost of claims (e.g. due to higher inflation than expected) from insurance business

<<<

 already written (see "Description o f the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and the Sampo Group -- Technical Provisions (Reserves)"). The level of provisions deemed to be sufficient is established by use of relevant actuarial methods that reflect

<<<

 assumptions and empirical outcomes. The If Group continuously monitors the adequacy of Technical Provisions and makes necessary adjustments as soon as new information is available. Unexpected increases in the cost of claims when measured against

<<<

 the level of provisions may occur nonetheless, for example due to the appearance of risks that have not yet been recognised or because the methods used for setting provisions prove to be inaccurate, which might have an adverse effect on the

<<<

 If Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

Emerging risk

The If Group is also subject to emerging insurance risks. By their very nature these risks

<<<

 are evolving, uncertain and difficult to quantify. Potential emerging risk exposures include, for example, areas such as nanotechnology, the environmental impact of climate change (for example, destruction caused to property by events such

<<<

 as flooding) and cyber related risks. Due to the difficulty in predicting these risks, potential emerging insurance risks could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. This may

<<<

, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

Catastrophe risk

Catastrophe risk (the risk of low frequency, high severity events that are often not captured adequately by the premium and reserve risk charge) is related to the type of

<<<

 events which could trigger multiple insured losses to property or to the person and thus might have a large financial impact on the If Group. Catastrophe risk can either result from natural catastrophes, for example windstorms, floods or other

<<<

 weather phenomena or man-made catastrophes such as acts of terrorism. Catastrophe risk is assessed at the If Group level and handled and mitigated through Reinsurance protection in order to protect the If Group balance sheet from severe outcomes

<<<

.

An unexpected increase in catastrophe claims could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

Reinsurance risk

Reinsurance

<<<

 is utilised for the purpose of protecting the If Group's capital against adverse outcomes of large claims and event losses (including, but not limited to, catastrophe risk) and to achieve tolerable result volatility aligned with an established

<<<

 risk tolerance level.

External Reinsurance programmes are purchased annually on an If Group-wide basis. In order to ensure that no legal entity within the If Group has an excessive risk level, intra-group Reinsurance arrangements are used

<<<

.

The If Group has Reinsurance programmes in place for all major lines of business including a group wide event programme. In addition there are separate Reinsurance programmes in place to cover specific risks, for example Reinsurance for terrorism

<<<

 risks in the United States which is purchased due to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and related legislation.

The If Group's Reinsurance protection is exposed to the following risks:

·

default of reinsurer(s) participating in the

<<<

 If Group's current or historic Reinsurance programme;

·

misinterpretation of Reinsurance wording resulting in lack of cover for specific risks or exposures;

·

mismatch in the timing of payments of claims against collection of Reinsurance

<<<

 recoveries;

·

claims outcome exceeding the amount of Reinsurance capacity purchased; and

·

reduced market capacity for certain risks or exposures, which makes it difficult to renew specific

programmes.

A failure of, or deficiency in,

<<<

 the level of Reinsurance cover could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

The I f Group is subject to investment

<<<

 and other market relatedfinancial risks

Investment returns are an important part in determining the If Group's overall profitability. Investment returns are susceptible to changes in general economic conditions, including changes affecting

<<<

 the general creditworthiness of the debt and equity securities held in the If Group's portfolios. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by, amongst other things, changes in the Issuer's creditworthiness. Where the

- 7-

creditworthiness

<<<

 of the issuer of a debt security worsens, the credit ratings of the security may change and the value of the security may decline.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk refers to the uncertainty in the values of assets and liabilities as

<<<

 well as interest income and expenses resulting from changes in market interest rates. When market interest rates rise, the balance sheet values of fixed income securities fall and this has an immediate impact on the If Group's equity capital

<<<

 and earnings (however, it is possible to reduce and even eliminate these effects by using interest rate derivatives). On the other hand, higher interest rates mean increased interest income for new investments, which gradually improves profitability

<<<

 and the If Group's capital position.

When market interest rates decrease, the balance sheet values of fixed income securities rise and this has an immediate impact on the value of the If Group's investment portfolio. Conversely, consistently

<<<

 low market interest rates would result in a reduction in the return on the If Group's future fixed income investments. Generally, investment income may be reduced during sustained periods of lower interest rates as higher yielding fixed income

<<<

 securities are called, mature or are sold and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates even though prices of fixed income securities tend to rise and gains realised upon their sale tend to increase at lower rates.

Credit spread volatility

<<<



The If Group's exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads will generally reduce the value of fixed income securities that the

<<<

 If Group holds.

Equity risk

The If Group is exposed to changes in the prices of its equity portfolio, which consists mainly of Scandinavian equities and global funds, which are generally subject to greater volatility and hence risks than

<<<

 fixed income securities. The policy of the If Group is to have a diversified portfolio among industry sectors and geographic regions, although general economic conditions and many other factors beyond the control of the If Group can adversely

<<<

 affect the equity markets and hence the If Group. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that an insurance undertaking will be unable to realise investments and other assets in

<<<

 order to settle its financial obligations when they fall due. Liquidity risk can be divided into the refinancing risk of debt and the market liquidity risk of investments.

·

Market liquidity risk of investments

Market liquidity risk is the

<<<

 risk that insurance undertakings are unable to realise investments and other assets in order to settle their financial obligations when they fall due. Market liquidity risk is reduced by placing certain amounts of investment in instruments

<<<

 generally considered to be liquid or with short maturities. However, if the If Group faces large-scale demands requiring immediate realisation of liquid assets, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations

<<<

 or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

·

Refinancing risk of debt

Refinancing risk is the risk that the If Group could face increased costs in relation to refinancing its debt. The If Group's

<<<

 refinancing risk is related mainly to the credit rating of its debt. Should the credit rating of the If Group or any of its main operating companies drop to a level such that the investment guidelines or regulations applicable to key investors

<<<

 prohibit the holding of the If Group's securities, these investors might be forced to decrease their investments in the If Group, which, in turn, could lead to an increase in the cost of new funding or restrict the If Group's ability to obtain

<<<

 new funding.

- 8-

Currency risk
Currency risk refers to the sensitivity of the values of assets, liabilities and financial instruments to changes in the level or in the volatility of currency exchange rates.
Currency risk is part of the

<<<

 If Group's normal business activities and investment decisions. Currency risk occurs in insurance activities where most of the written insurance policies are denominated in Scandinavian currencies and in Euros. This currency risk is reduced

<<<

 by matching Technical Provisions with investment assets in the corresponding currencies or by using currency derivatives. The currency exposure in the insurance operations is hedged to the base currency on a regular basis. The currency exposure

<<<

 in investment assets is controlled weekly and is hedged when the exposure reaches a specified level, which is set with respect to cost efficiency and minimum transaction size. Currency risk also arises in investment management, where active

<<<

 currency positions are taken, (see "Risk factors - risks relating to the Notes generally --Exchange rate risks and exchange controls").
The If Group is also exposed to translation risk. Translation risk refers to currency risk that arises when

<<<

 consolidating the financial statements of foreign operations that have a different base currency than the Issuer in the If Group's financial statements. The major functional currencies other than Swedish kronor are Euro, Norwegian kroner and

<<<

 Danish kroner. Since the If Group presents its consolidated financial statements in Swedish kronor, the If Group's consolidated balance sheet and income statement may be affected by exchange differences between the Swedish kronor and the other

<<<

 functional currencies. The translation risk is not hedged.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise from a borrower, issuer of bonds or counterparty failing to make required payments. Credit risk is closely tied to the potential

<<<

 return of an investment in the sense that a higher potential return usually means a higher credit risk. The If Group is exposed to credit risk through, amongst other things, holdings of fixed income instruments, Reinsurance agreements and loan

<<<

 advances. A failure by an issuer of a security or of a counterparty to a Reinsurance agreement to meet its obligations could have a material impact on the If Group's financial position. The counterparty risk in the If Group's investment portfolios

<<<

 mainly arises from financial institutions and corporations in the Nordic region. In addition, when it comes to credit risk, the If Group is exposed to concentration risk, which is managed by taking into account the If Group's concentration

<<<

 exposure by industry sectors, products and creditworthiness when setting individual issuer-specific limits in the investment policy. The If Group's investments are also exposed to the spread risk which relates mainly to changes in the credit

<<<

 spreads of fixed income investments. Additionally, counterparty risk related to reinsurers arises through Reinsurance receivables and through the reinsurers' portion of outstanding claims. The If Group has substantial exposure to reinsurers

<<<

 through Reinsurance arrangements. Under such arrangements other insurers assume a portion of the costs, losses and expenses associated with policy claims and maturities, and reported and unreported losses, in exchange for a portion of the policy

<<<

 premiums. The availability, amount and cost of Reinsurance depend on general market conditions and may vary significantly. Any decrease in the amount of Reinsurance cover purchased will increase the If Group's risk of loss. When Reinsurance

<<<

 is obtained, the If Group is still liable for those transferred risks if the reinsurer does not meet its obligations. Therefore, the inability or failure of reinsurers to meet their financial obligations could materially affect the If Group

<<<

's operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.
Systemic risk
The If Group is exposed to systemic risk which is the risk whereby default by a financial institution, or general concerns as to

<<<

 its creditworthiness, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions because the stability of many financial institutions may be closely linked to credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between

<<<

 such financial institutions. Such liquidity problems may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing houses, banks and securities firms with which the If Group interacts on a daily basis and, therefore, could adversely affect

<<<

 the If Group both directly and indirectly.
Asset Liability Management
Asset Liability Management ("ALM") risk is the risk of a change in value resulting from a deviation between assets and liability cash flows, prices or carrying amounts caused

<<<

 by a change in actual cash flows
- 9-

or a change in expectations of future cash flows. ALM risk is caused by differences in the sensitivity of investments and Technical Provisions to interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

The If Group

<<<

's ALM risk is mainly attributable to the following:

·

discrepancies in the impact of fluctuations in the level of, or volatility of, interest rates on assets

and liabilities; and

·

discrepancies in currency exposure between assets and

<<<

 liabilities, causing sensitivity to currency

movements against Swedish kronor which might have an adverse financial impact.

The I f Group is subject to operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed

<<<

 internal processes and systems, from human errors, or from external events. Each business area, as well as the corporate functions, of the If Group has responsibility for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing operational risks within

<<<

 its various units.

The If Group's business is dependent on processing a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse products. Systems and processes are designed to ensure that the operational risks associated with the

<<<

 If Group's activities are appropriately controlled, but a weakness in the systems could negatively impact its results of operations.

The If Group is also dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of its IT and telephone systems

<<<

, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunication failure, negligence or similar misconduct or events beyond its control. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the If Group

<<<

's operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

The I f Group is subject to reputational risk

The If Group is vulnerable to adverse market perception as it operates in a regulated industry

<<<

 where it must display a high level of integrity and maintain the trust and the confidence of customers. Reputational risks are related to the way the If Group is perceived from the perspective of different stakeholders (shareholders, customers

<<<

, staff, business partners or the general public). Reputational risks may arise through external distribution channels, the behaviour of which could be difficult to control. Mismanagement, fraud or failure to satisfy regulatory responsibilities

<<<

, which may result from actions and conduct of individual employees and thus may be difficult to control, and the resulting negative publicity from such activities could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations

<<<

 and/or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

The I f Group is subject to litigation risk

There are a number of legal proceedings currently ongoing against the If Group, arising in the ordinary course

<<<

 of business. An unfavourable outcome of potential future litigation could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

<<<



The If Group conducts its business subject to regulation and associated regulatory risks, including the effects of changes in the laws, regulations, policies and interpretations and any accounting standards in the markets in which it operates

<<<



Regulatory compliance and regulatory changes

Insurance is a highly regulated business with formal rules for minimum capital and capital structure and the If Group's business is subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it conducts

<<<

 business. Supervisory authorities have broad jurisdiction over many aspects of the If Group's business, which may include capital adequacy, marketing and selling practices, licences, policy terms and conditions, terms of business and permitted

<<<

 investments. The If Group believes that it complies with all current legal requirements. However, regulation in countries in which the If Group operates may change, which could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results

<<<

 of operations and/or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.

On the 1st of January 2016, the Solvency II Directive was implemented in each of the markets in which the If Group operates. Solvency

<<<

 II is a risk-based solvency regime, which aims to deepen the integration of the insurance and Reinsurance market, enhance the protection of policyholders and beneficiaries, improve international competitiveness of EU insurers and reinsurers

<<<

 and promote better regulation. Compared with Solvency I, the regulatory capital requirements under Solvency II are designed to more accurately reflect the specific risk profile of each undertaking.
Having prepared for the implementation of

<<<

 Solvency II over a number of years before it entered into force on 1 January 2016, the If Group now believes that it has adapted well to the challenges and opportunities presented in the new regulatory framework. However, while the aim of Solvency

<<<

 II is to introduce a harmonised, risk-based approach to solvency capital, there is a risk of differences in interpretation and a risk of a failure by financial supervisory authorities to align Solvency II approaches across Europe, resulting

<<<

 in an unequal competitive landscape. Compliance with the Solvency II requirements cannot be guaranteed and potential non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations and/or financial condition

<<<

. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.
All financial services groups face the risk that regulators may find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required

<<<

. Regulatory proceedings could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the If Group, as well as diverting management's attention and resources away from the day-to-day management of the business. A significant regulatory

<<<

 action against the If Group could have a material adverse effect on the business of the If Group, its results of operations and/or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.
In addition, changes in government

<<<

 policy, legislation or regulatory interpretation applying to the financial services industry in the markets in which the If Group operates may adversely affect its product range, distribution channels, capital requirements and, consequently

<<<

, its results of operations and financing requirements.
Capital may not be completely fungible between different regulated legal entities within the Issuer's Group and the Solvency II Group (as the case may be), which may have negative consequencesfo

<<<

 r such legal entities
The Issuer Group and the Solvency II Group's regulated legal entities must satisfy local regulatory capital requirements. There could potentially be some local regulatory constraints, which in certain circumstances could

<<<

 affect the Issuer Group and the Solvency II Group's ability to transfer capital from one legal entity to another, and in particular from one subsidiary or a branch to another, or to the parent legal entity. This may have negative consequences

<<<

 for the legal entity concerned and could have a material adverse impact on the Issuer Group and the Solvency II Group, in particular if some own funds are deemed to be not transferable by the Issuer Supervisor and therefore not recognised as

<<<

 own funds eligible to meet the solvency capital requirements of the Issuer Group (if applicable) and the Solvency II Group. This may have a material impact on the solvency position of the Issuer Group (if applicable) and the Solvency II Group

<<<

, and therefore have an adverse effect on the value of the Notes.
Accounting compliance and riskfrom possible accounting changes
Financial statements presented for the Issuer are prepared in accordance with Swedish laws and regulations. The

<<<

 If Group has prepared the consolidated accounts in accordance with international accounting standards (IFRS including IAS, SIC and IFRIC), as adopted by the European Union. In addition, the If Group applies the supplementary provisions ensuing

<<<

 from legislation, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and recommendations as well as appropriate parts of recommendations issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.
Issued, but not yet effective, international accounting

<<<

 standards are currently assessed as not likely to have any significant impact on the financial statements when first applied, except IFRS 9 Financial Instruments ("IFRS 9") and IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts ("IFRS 17"), and, to a certain extent

<<<

, IFRS 16 Leases ("IFRS 16").
IFRS 9 has been adopted for use in the European Union but in an adopted amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, the IASB has decided that in certain circumstances insurance companies can delay their first application

<<<

 of IFRS 9. The If Group fulfils these conditions since the If Group has not previously applied
- 11 -

IFRS 9 and the carrying amount of the liabilities connected to insurance is greater than 90 per cent. of the total carrying amount of the

<<<

 liabilities. The If Group plans to implement IFRS 9 later than its ordinary effective date on 1 January 2018. The transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 is not expected to have any significant effects on the If Group's accounts until 2021, although

<<<

 some expanded disclosure will be added in 2018. Since, among other considerations, the notion of business model will be important and IFRS 9 includes some optionality, the If Group believes that there will be significant cross-influences to

<<<

 the published, (but not yet adopted) standard for IFRS 17 that need to be carefully assessed.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("IFRS 15") has been adopted by the European Union and took effect on 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 replaces

<<<

 existing standards and interpretations pertaining to revenue recognition, with the exception of the recognition of insurance contracts. For the If Group, IFRS 15 applies to revenue in the insurance operations other than revenue involving a

<<<

 transfer of insurance risk. Such revenue is recognised as "other technical income" in profit and loss and comprises an insignificant share of the If Group's overall operations and earnings. According to the If Group's assessment, transitioning

<<<

 from revenue recognition in accordance with the existing IAS 18 standard to revenue recognition in accordance with IFRS 15 will not have any material impact on the If Group's financial position or earnings.
IFRS 16 has been adopted by the European

<<<

 Union and will take effect on 1 January 2019, at which time the If Group plans to apply it. IFRS 16 replaces the existing IAS 17. The current assessment is that IFRS 16 is expected to have a limited impact on the If Group's financial position

<<<

 and earnings, although total assets will increase slightly since a portion of the If Group's leases will be recognised in the balance sheet as fixed assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The If Group's Technical Result may

<<<

 also improve slightly since current leasing costs, which are included in operating costs, are divided between depreciation/amortisation and interest expense, respectively, which are included in profit from asset management.
IFRS 17 was published

<<<

 in May 2017 and is expected to take effect on 1 January 2021. IFRS 17 has not yet been adopted by the European Union. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and, unlike its predecessor, contains a complete framework for the measurement

<<<

 and presentation of insurance contracts. Based on an initial, preliminary assessment, the measurement rules in IFRS 17 are expected to have a limited effect on the If Group's profit and loss and balance sheet, while the presentation rules may

<<<

 have a material impact.
Changes in tax legislation may result in adverse tax consequences fo r the I f Group
Tax rules, including those relating to the insurance industry, and their interpretation, may change, possibly with retrospective effect

<<<

, in any of the jurisdictions in which the If Group operates. Significant tax disputes with tax authorities, and any change in the tax status of any member of the If Group or in taxation legislation or its scope or interpretation could affect

<<<

 the If Group's financial condition and results of operation. This may, in turn, adversely impact the value of the Notes.
On 20 June 2017, a memorandum proposing new interest deduction limitation rules regarding both internal and external interests

<<<

, was published by the Swedish government. The proposal contains two alternatives: a general limitation of interest deductions in the corporate sector is firstly proposed as an earnings before interest and tax ("EBIT") rule (the "EBIT rule"

<<<

), where the cap for a deduction of net interest expenses is calculated as 35 per cent. of tax EBIT and, secondarily, as an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ("EBITDA") rule (the "EBITDA rule"), where the cap for

<<<

 deduction of net interest expenses is calculated as 25 per cent. of tax EBITDA. The rules are proposed to enter into force on 1 July 2018 and are to be applied for the first time in the financial year beginning after 30 June 2018. The Swedish

<<<

 government is expected to present a final law proposal during the spring of 2018. If the If Group's net interest expenses, following any implementation of legislation based on this proposal, represent a substantial portion in relation to its

<<<

 tax EBIT or tax EBITDA, or if any other additional restriction on the deductibility of interest expenses is introduced in Sweden, the If Group's tax burden could increase and this could have a negative impact on the If Group's business, results

<<<

 of operations and financial position.
As a part of the memorandum published on 20 June 2017, the Swedish government proposes that tax losses carried forward in a company can, at a maximum, be deducted with 50 per cent. of the company's taxable

<<<

 profit. Losses, which are thus non-deductible, may be carried forward to subsequent years. These limitations are proposed to be in effect only during a certain period of time. As regards the EBIT rule, the limitations are proposed to apply

<<<

 to financial years beginning after 30 June 2018 and before 1 July 2020. As regards
- 12 -

the EBITDA rule, the limitations are proposed to apply to financial years beginning after 30 June 2018 and before 1 July 2021. The proposed limitation

<<<

 applies regardless of whether a company has net interest expenses or not.
Moreover, an additional part of the memorandum published on 20 June 2017 included proposed taxation of the contingency reserve of an insurance company. The memorandum

<<<

 includes a temporary standard taxable income, in relation to a decreased corporate tax rate, and a permanent standard taxable income. The permanent standard income is to be calculated as the security reserve of an insurance company at the beginning

<<<

 of the year, multiplied by the Swedish government loan rate (a minimum 0.5 per cent.). The temporary standard income is to be calculated as 10 per cent. of the security reserve of an insurance company at the beginning of the financial year

<<<

 to be taxed over six years or at the election of the company during the first financial year starting after the proposed enactment on 1 July 2018.
The tax payable by the If Group could also increase as a result of the proposal to make changes

<<<

 in the tax deductibility for reserves in Norway. On 7 February 2018 the Norwegian Ministry of Finance published a proposal for changes in the tax regulation for insurance and pension entities in Norway, including inter alia a proposal to amend

<<<

 the regulation related to tax deductibility for reserves. The Ministry of Finance propose that the changes become effective from the income year of 2018. The proposal are subject to the parliamentary process in Norway and it is currently unclear

<<<

 if, and to what extent, the proposal will enter into law.
Risks relating to the structure of the Notes
There is no scheduled redemption datefo r the Notes and Noteholders have no right to require redemption
The Notes are undated securities

<<<

 in respect of which there is no fixed redemption or maturity date. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Notes at any time and the Noteholders have no right to require the Issuer to redeem or purchase any Notes at any time. Any redemption

<<<

 of the Notes and any purchase of any Notes by the Issuer will be subject always to the preconditions to redemption set out in Condition 7(f) (Conditions to redemption, purchase, variation and substitution), and the prior approval of the Issuer

<<<

 Supervisor (if required).
Therefore, Noteholders will have no ability to exit their investment, except (i) in the event of the Issuer exercising its right to redeem or purchase the Notes in accordance with the Conditions, (ii) by selling their

<<<

 Notes, or (iii) upon a Liquidation (Sw. likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) of the Issuer, in which limited circumstances the Noteholders may receive some or any resulting bankruptcy or liquidation proceeds following payment being made

<<<

 in full to all senior and more senior subordinated creditors. The proceeds, if any, realised by the action described in (iii) above may be substantially less than the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes or the amount of the investor's

<<<

 investment in the Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should, therefore, be aware that they will be required to bear the financial risks associated with an investment in long term securities.
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are

<<<

 subordinated
The claims of Noteholders and Couponholders against the Issuer in respect of payments of principal and interest on the Notes will, in the event of the Liquidation (Sw. likvidation), dissolution, administration or other winding

<<<

-up of the Issuer, be subordinated in right of payment to the claims of all creditors of the Issuer (i) who are policyholders from time to time or who are other unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer, (ii) whose claims constitute (or would,

<<<

 but for any application limitation of such capital) constitute Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital of the Issuer, and (iii) whose claims are to other subordinated obligations of the Issuer expressed to rank senior to the Notes, or otherwise rank

<<<

 or are expressed to rank senior to the Notes ("Senior Creditors"). If, on a winding-up which commences prior to a Trigger Event, the assets of the Issuer are insufficient to enable the Issuer to repay the claims of more senior-ranking creditors

<<<

 in full, the Noteholders will lose their entire investment in the Notes. If there are sufficient assets to enable the Issuer to pay the claims of senior-ranking creditors in full but insufficient assets to enable it to pay claims in respect

<<<

 of its obligations in respect of the Notes and all other claims that rank pari passu with the Notes, Noteholders will lose some (which may be substantially all) of their investment in the Notes.
In addition, as further described below under

<<<

 "Upon the occurrence o f a Trigger Event, the principal amount o fthe Notes will be Written Down", the principal amount of the Notes will, in certain circumstances,
- 13 -

be Written Down, (without the need for consent of the Noteholders

<<<

) as set out in Condition 6 (Principal Loss Absorption).
Although subordinated notes may pay a higher rate of interest than comparable notes which are not subordinated, there is a real risk that an investor in the Notes will lose all or some

<<<

 of his investment should the Issuer become insolvent.
As the Issuer is a holding company, Noteholders are structurally subordinated to the creditors o f the Issuer's Subsidiaries
The Notes are the obligations of the Issuer alone. The Issuer

<<<

 is a holding company and the Issuer's Subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities with no obligation to pay, or provide funds in respect of, any amounts due and payable in respect of the Issuer's payment obligations under the Notes

<<<

.
Payments on the Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Issuer's Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries will have priority as to the assets of such Subsidiaries over

<<<

 the Issuer and its creditors, including the Noteholders. Neither the Conditions nor the Trust Deed contain any restrictions on the ability of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries or associates to incur additional unsecured or secured indebtedness

<<<

.
As a holding company, the level o f the Issuer's Distributable Items is affected by a number o ffactors and insufficient Distributable Items will restrict the Issuer's ability to make Interest Payments on the Notes
As a holding company, the

<<<

 level of the Issuer's Distributable Items is affected by a number of factors, principally its ability to receive funds, directly or indirectly, from its Subsidiaries in a manner which creates Distributable Items. Consequently, the Issuer's

<<<

 future Distributable Items, and therefore the Issuer's ability to make interest payments on the Notes, are a function of the Issuer's existing Distributable Items, future profitability of the Issuer's Group and its performance and the ability

<<<

 to distribute or dividend profits from the Issuer's Subsidiaries up the If Group structure to the Issuer. In addition, the Issuer's Distributable Items will also be reduced by the servicing of other debt and equity instruments.
The ability

<<<

 of the Issuer's subsidiaries to pay dividends and the Issuer's ability to receive distributions and other payments from the Issuer's investments in other entities is subject to applicable local laws and other restrictions, including their respective

<<<

 regulatory, capital and leverage requirements, statutory reserves, financial and operating performance and applicable tax laws, and any changes thereto. These laws and restrictions could limit the payment of dividends, distributions and other

<<<

 payments to the Issuer by the Issuer's Subsidiaries, which could in time restrict the level of the Issuer's Distributable Items. The Issuer's Distributable Items as at 31 December 2017 were SEK 15,036 million.
Interest Payments on the Notes

<<<

 are discretionary and the Issuer may cancel Interest Payments (in whole or in part) at any time. Cancelled Interest Payments shall not be due and shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter and investors shall have no rights thereto

<<<


Interest on the Notes will be due and payable only at the sole and absolute discretion of the Issuer and is subject to Condition 4(b) (Mandatory Interest Cancellation). The Issuer may at any time elect to cancel any Interest Payment, in whole

<<<

 or in part, which would otherwise be due and payable on any Interest Payment Date. At the time of publication of this Prospectus, it is the intention of the Directors to take into account the relative ranking in the Issuer's capital structure

<<<

 of its Ordinary Shares and its outstanding Tier 1 securities (including, but not limited to, the Notes) whenever exercising its discretion to declare dividends on the former or to cancel interest on the latter. However, the Directors may depart

<<<

 from this policy at any time in their sole discretion.
Any Interest Payment (or relevant part thereof) which is cancelled shall not accumulate and shall not become due and payable at any time thereafter. In the event of such cancellation, Noteholders

<<<

 will have no rights in respect of the Interest Payment (or relevant part thereof) which is cancelled. In addition, cancellation or non-payment of interest in accordance with the Conditions shall not constitute a default or event of default

<<<

 on the part of the Issuer for any purpose.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of Interest Payments will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation provision of the

<<<

 Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market price of other debt securities on which interest
- 14 -

accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in

<<<

 the financial condition of the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency II Group. Noteholders should be aware that any announcement relating to the future cancellation of Interest Payments or any actual cancellation of Interest

<<<

 Payments may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. Noteholders may find it difficult to sell their Notes in such circumstances, or may only be able to sell their Notes at a price which may be significantly lower than the

<<<

 price at which they purchased their Notes. In such event, Noteholders may lose some or substantially all of their investment in the Notes.

Payments by the Issuer are conditional upon the Issuer being solvent

Payments in respect of or arising

<<<

 from (including any damages for breach of any obligations under) the Notes shall be conditional upon the Issuer being solvent at the time for payment by the Issuer and no amount shall be due and payable by the Issuer in respect of or arising

<<<

 from (including any damages for breach of any obligations under) the Notes except to the extent that the Issuer could make such payment and still be solvent immediately thereafter. For these purposes, the Issuer will be solvent if (i) it is

<<<

 able to pay its debts owed to Senior Creditors as they fall due and (ii) its Assets exceed its Liabilities. Any payment of interest that would have been due and payable but for the inability to comply with the Solvency Condition shall be cancelled

<<<

 in full pursuant to Condition 4(b) (Mandatory Interest Cancellation).

Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the principal amount of the Notes will be Written Down

If at any time a Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer shall immediately notify

<<<

 the Issuer Supervisor and, without delay and by no later than one month (or such other period as the Issuer Supervisor may then require) from the occurrence of the relevant Trigger Event, shall:

(i)

cancel all interest accrued to (but excluding

<<<

) the Write Down Date (whether or not such interest

has become due for payment and including any interest scheduled for payment on the Write Down

Date);

(ii) (without the need for the consent of the Noteholders) reduce the then Prevailing

<<<

 Principal Amount to SEK 0.01.

Any such decision shall be binding on the Noteholders as described in the Conditions.

The Write Down of the Notes will affect the claims of the Noteholders in various respects. Firstly, in the event of a Liquidation

<<<

 (Sw. likvidation) of the Issuer, the claims of the Noteholders will be in respect of the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes at the time of the Liquidation (Sw. likvidation) of the Issuer, and not for the Initial Principal Amount. Similarly

<<<

, upon a redemption or purchase of the Notes by the Issuer following the occurrence of a Special Event, the redemption or purchase of each Note will be at its Prevailing Principal Amount (together with accrued and unpaid interest) and not its

<<<

 Initial Principal Amount.

Secondly, interest will accrue only on the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes from time to time, and accordingly for so long as the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes is less than their Initial Principal

<<<

 Amount, the maximum amount of interest which may be paid by the Issuer (subject always to applicable payment restrictions and interest cancellation as provided above) on any Interest Payment Date shall be less than if no Write Down had occurred

<<<

.

In addition, as the occurrence of a Trigger Event is linked to the Solvency Capital Requirement and the Minimum Capital Requirement of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be), any actual or perceived

<<<

 reduction in such Solvency Capital Requirement or the Minimum Capital Requirement may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.

A Write Down may occur on any one or more occasions, and the Prevailing Principal Amount of the

<<<

 Notes may be reduced to SEK 0.01. Noteholders will not be entitled to any compensation or other payment as a result of any Write Down of their Notes. Accordingly, if a Trigger Event occurs, Noteholders could lose all of the value of their investment

<<<

 in the Notes if the Issuer subsequently redeems the Notes following the occurrence of a Special Event or if a Liquidation (Sw. likvidation) of the Issuer occurs.

The occurrence of a Trigger Event is inherently unpredictable and depends on

<<<

 a number of factors, which may be outside the control of the Issuer. The determination by the Issuer or the Issuer Supervisor (as applicable) that a Trigger Event has occurred shall be based on information (whether or not published)

- 15 

<<<

-

available to management of the Issuer, including information internally reported within the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group and/or shared with the Issuer Supervisor (as applicable) pursuant to the procedures for ensuring

<<<

 effective on-going monitoring of the applicable capital ratios. Accordingly, investors may be unable to predict accurately if and when a Trigger Event may occur. See "The circumstances surrounding or triggering a Write Down are unpredictable

<<<

, and there are a number o f factors, any o fwhich may be outside the Issuer's control, that could affect the Solvency Capital Requirement or Minimum Capital Requirement o f the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency II Group 

<<<

(as the case may be)" below.
The Issuer intends to publish information regarding its solvency capital as part of its financial statements each year. However, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will publicly report such information at

<<<

 such intervals or at any other time.
Whilst the Conditions provide for Discretionary Reinstatement of the principal amount of the Notes in certain circumstances, any such Discretionary Reinstatement will be in the sole and full discretion of

<<<

 the Issuer, there is no provision for the automatic Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes in any circumstances and any Discretionary Reinstatement will be subject to certain restrictions. Discretionary Reinstatement may only occur if the

<<<

 Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be) is in compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement and will not be implemented by reference to Own Fund Items issued or increased in order to restore such compliance

<<<

 with the Solvency Capital Requirement. Further, a Discretionary Reinstatement will occur only on the basis of profits which contribute to the Issuer's Distributable Items and will not be permitted in the situation where an Insolvent Insurer

<<<

 Winding-up has occurred or is continuing or where a Discretionary Reinstatement would cause a Trigger Event. Discretionary Reinstatement is also subject to compliance with the Relevant Rules. See "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes --Condition

<<<

 6(c) (Discretionary Reinstatement)" for further details. Even if, following a Trigger Event, the Issuer records sufficient Distributable Items, there can be no assurance that any Discretionary Reinstatement of any part of the principal amount

<<<

 of the Notes will be effected.
The circumstances surrounding or triggering a Write Down are unpredictable, and there are a number of factors, any of which may be outside the Issuer's control, that could affect the Solvency Capital Requirement

<<<

 or Minimum Capital Requirement of the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be)
A Trigger Event occurs if at any time the Issuer determines that any of the following: (i) the amount of Own Fund Items

<<<

 eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be) determined under the Relevant Rules is equal to or less than 75 per cent. of the Solvency Capital Requirement

<<<

; or (ii) the amount of Own Fund Items eligible to cover the Minimum Capital Requirement of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be) determined under the Relevant Rules is equal to or less than the Minimum

<<<

 Capital Requirement; or (iii) the amount of Own Fund Items eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be) has been less than the Solvency Capital Requirement

<<<

 for a continuous period of three months (commencing on the date on which non-compliance with such Solvency Capital Requirement was first observed).
The occurrence of a Trigger Event and, therefore, Write Down of the Prevailing Principal Amount

<<<

 pursuant to Condition 6(a) (Write Down), is to some extent unpredictable and depends on a number of factors, some of which may be outside of the Issuer's control, including actions that the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency

<<<

 II Group (as the case may be) are required to take at the direction of the relevant supervisor or as a result of regulatory changes. Accordingly, the trading behaviour of the Notes may not necessarily follow the trading behaviour of other types

<<<

 of subordinated securities, including the Issuer's other subordinated debt securities. Any actual or perceived indication that a Trigger Event may occur can be expected to have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes

<<<

. The level of the Solvency Capital Requirement or Minimum Capital Requirement may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with

<<<

 a yield comparable to other types of subordinated securities, including the Issuer's other subordinated debt securities.
- 16 -

Redemption payments under the Notes must, under certain circumstances, be deferred
Notwithstanding that a notice

<<<

 of redemption has been delivered to Noteholders, the Issuer must defer redemption of the Notes on any date set for redemption of the Notes pursuant to Condition 7 (Redemption, Purchase, Substitution and Variation) in the event that, inter alia

<<<

, the Issuer cannot make the redemption payments in compliance with the Solvency Condition or the Regulatory Pre-Conditions, or an Insolvent Insurer Winding-up has occurred and is continuing.
The deferral of redemption of the Notes will not

<<<

 constitute a default under the Notes for any purpose and will not give Noteholders or the Trustee any right to take any enforcement action under the Notes or the Trust Deed. Where redemption of the Notes is deferred, the Notes will be redeemed

<<<

 by the Issuer on the earlier of (a) the date falling 10 Business Days after the date on which the Regulatory Pre-Conditions are (and provided that they continue to be) met or (where capable of waiver) waived pursuant to Condition 7(g) (Exceptional

<<<

 Waiver o fRegulatory Pre-Conditions) or (b) the date on which an order for the liquidation of the Issuer is made.
Any actual or anticipated deferral of redemption of the Notes will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes

<<<

. In addition, as a result of the redemption deferral provision of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities without such deferral feature, including dated securities where

<<<

 redemption on the scheduled maturity date cannot be deferred, and the Notes may accordingly be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition.
The Notes are subject to optional redemption by the Issuer
The Issuer

<<<

 may, at its option and subject to the Regulatory Pre-Conditions, redeem the Notes at their Prevailing Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest (or substitute the Notes for, or vary the terms of the Notes so that they become or remain

<<<

, Qualifying Notes) upon the occurrence of certain events, including a Tax Event, a Capital Disqualification Event, an Accounting Event or a Rating Agency Event, as further described in Condition 7 (Redemption, Purchase, Substitution and Variation

<<<

).
The right of the Issuer to redeem the Notes in certain circumstances may limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise above the

<<<

 price at which they can be redeemed.
An investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower

<<<

 rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
Notes may be traded with accrued interest which may subsequently be subject to cancellation
The Notes may trade, and/or the prices

<<<

 for the Notes may appear, in trading systems with accrued interest. Purchasers of Notes in the secondary market may pay a price which reflects such accrued interest on purchase of the Notes.
If an Interest Payment is cancelled (in whole or

<<<

 in part) as described above, a purchaser of Notes in the secondary market will not be entitled to the accrued interest (or part thereof) reflected in the purchase price of the Notes.
No limitation on issuingfurther debt
There is no restriction

<<<

 on the amount of debt which the Issuer may issue ranking equal or senior to the obligations under or in connection with the Notes subject to prior approval from the Issuer Supervisor. Such issuance of further debt may reduce the amount recoverable

<<<

 by the Noteholders upon insolvency or winding-up of the Issuer or may increase the likelihood that payments of the principal amount or interest under the Notes will be mandatorily suspended or deferred or may, in the case of interest payments

<<<

, be cancelled at the option of the Issuer.
In addition, the Notes do not contain any "negative pledge" or similar clause, meaning that the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may pledge its or their assets to secure other obligations without granting

<<<

 similar security in respect of the Notes.
- 17 -

There are no events o f default under the Notes
The Conditions do not provide for events of default allowing acceleration of the Notes if certain events occur. Accordingly, if the Issuer fails

<<<

 to meet any obligations under the Notes, including the payment of any interest when due, investors will not have any right of acceleration in respect of the Notes.
Upon a payment default, the sole remedy available to Noteholders for recovery

<<<

 of amounts owing in respect of any payment of principal or interest on the Notes will be the institution of proceedings to enforce such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not, by virtue of the institution of any such proceedings

<<<

, be obliged to pay any sum or sums sooner than the same would otherwise have been payable by it.
Variation or substitution o f the Notes without Noteholder consent
Subject as provided in Condition 7 (Redemption, Purchase, Substitution and Variation

<<<

), the Issuer may, at its option and without the consent or approval of Noteholders, elect to substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes for, or vary the terms of the Notes so that they become or remain, Qualifying Notes (i) in the event

<<<

 of certain changes in the tax treatment of the Notes or payments thereunder due to a Tax Event, or (ii) following the occurrence of a Capital Disqualification Event or, (iii) following the occurrence of an Accounting Event, or (iv) following

<<<

 the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event, the Issuer may elect to substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes for, or vary the terms of the Notes so that they become or remain, Qualifying Notes.
Qualifying Notes are securities issued by

<<<

 the Issuer that have, inter alia, terms not materially less favourable to the Noteholders than the terms of the Notes (as reasonably determined by the Issuer in consultation with a bank of financial advisor of international standing). There

<<<

 can be no assurance that, due to the particular circumstances of each Noteholder, any Qualifying Notes will be as favourable to each Noteholder in all respects or that, if it were entitled to do so, a particular Noteholder would make the same

<<<

 determination as the Issuer as to whether the terms of the relevant Qualifying Notes are not materially less favourable to Noteholders than the terms of the Notes. The Issuer bears no responsibility towards the Noteholders for any adverse effects

<<<

 of such substitution or variation (including, without limitation, with respect to any adverse tax consequences suffered by any Noteholder).
Set-offrisk
Subject to applicable law, no Noteholder who shall be indebted to the Issuer shall be entitled

<<<

 to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against moneys owed to the Issuer in respect of such indebtedness.
The market value o fthe Notes could decrease if the creditworthiness o f the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group

<<<

 worsens
If the likelihood that the Issuer will be in a position to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due decreases, for example, because of the materialisation of any of the risks regarding the Issuer, the Issuer

<<<

's Group and/or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be), the market value of the Notes may suffer. In addition, even if the likelihood that the Issuer will be in position to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due

<<<

 has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless have a different perception.
In addition, the market participants' estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating in the same business

<<<

 as the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group could adversely change. If any of these risks occurs, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower price than before the materialisation of the aforementioned risk

<<<

. Under these circumstances, the market value of the Notes may decrease.
Uncertainties remain in the manner in which Solvency II will be interpreted
The defined terms in the Conditions will depend in some cases on the interpretation of Solvency

<<<

 II. The implementation of the Solvency II Directive in Finland and the "level two" implementation measures set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 entered into force on 1 January 2016.
- 18 -

There can be

<<<

 no assurance that the "level two" implementation measures and "level three" guidance will not be amended. Moreover, although the Solvency II Regulation is directly applicable in each Member State, the Solvency II Regulation leaves a number

<<<

 of interpretational issues to be resolved through binding technical standards that have been adopted, and will be adopted in the future, and leaves certain other matters to the discretion of regulators, including the Financial Supervisory Authority

<<<

 in Finland (Fi. Finanssivalvonta). There is therefore a degree of uncertainty as to how the Financial Supervisory Authority in Finland (Fi. Finanssivalvonta) will interpret the Solvency II Directive as implemented in Finland, the "level two

<<<

" implementation measures and/or "level three" guidance and apply them to the Solvency II Group, the Issuer or the Issuer's Group.
In addition to capital requirement framework changes in the insurance industry such as Solvency II, the capital

<<<

 requirement framework changes in the banking industry such as fundamental reforms to the regulatory capital framework for internationally active banks proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ("BCBS") are relevant for the Sampo

<<<

 Group through its associated company Nordea. Nordea is required to meet more stringent and extensive capital requirements in the future, including, but not limited to, Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2

<<<

6 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms and the direct application of a European Parliament and Council regulation in each member state of the EEA

<<<

, the directive providing for the establishment of a European-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and the Financial Stability Board's Total Loss Absorbing Capacity standard for global systemically

<<<

 important banks. Potential non-compliance by Nordea could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Sampo Group, which could adversely impact the Issuer's ability to fulfill its obligations

<<<

 under or in connection with the Notes. On 6 September 2017, Nordea announced that the Nordea Bank AB (publ) board of directors has initiated a re-domiciliation of its parent company to Finland, and on 7 December 2017, the BCBS published the

<<<

 finalised measures to reform the regulatory capital framework for internationally active banks (known as "Basel III"). Both of these developments could also have a negative effect on Nordea's capital requirements and the Sampo Group's regulatory

<<<

 solvency position.
Further, in addition to changes to the abovementioned regulatory framework and the impact of the contemplated change in Nordea Bank AB (publ), Sampo has recently announced investments in each of Nets A/S, Saxo Bank A/S and

<<<

 Nordax Group AB (publ), which may also have an impact on Sampo Group SCR and own funds. See "Description o f the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and the Sampo Group --Sampo Group - Recent developments" for further details.
Changes to Solvency II

<<<

 or other applicable law or regulation may increase the risk o f the occurrence o f a Trigger Event, cancellation o f interestpayments or the occurrence o f a Capital Disqualification Event
Solvency II requirements adopted in Finland, whether

<<<

 as a result of further changes to Solvency II or changes to the way in which the Issuer Supervisor interprets and applies these requirements to the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be) may change. Any

<<<

 such changes, either individually and/or in aggregate, may lead to further unexpected requirements in relation to the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement, and such changes may make the applicable regulatory capital requirements

<<<

 more onerous. Such changes that may occur in the application of Solvency II in Finland subsequent to the date of this Prospectus and/or subsequent changes to such rules and other variables may individually or in aggregate negatively affect

<<<

 the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement and thus increase the risk of cancellation of interest payments, the occurrence of a Capital Disqualification Event and subsequent redemption of the Notes by the Issuer, or a Trigger Event

<<<

 occurring, which will lead to a reduction of the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes, as a result of which a Noteholder could lose all of the value of its investment in the Notes.
Additionally, the Issuer may be required to raise further

<<<

 capital pursuant to applicable law or regulation or the official interpretation thereof in order to maintain the then applicable Minimum Capital Requirement and Solvency Capital Requirement.
Regulatory oversight and application o f Minimum

<<<

 Capital Requirements and Solvency Capital Requirements to the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency II Group
As of the date of this Prospectus, events which may give rise to a Trigger Event, a Capital Disqualification Event and a Regulatory

<<<

 Deficiency Event (each of which may lead to a Write Down of the Notes, an optional early redemption of the Notes, or a mandatory cancellation of interest payments under the Notes,
- 19 -

as the case may be) apply in relation to the Solvency

<<<

 II Group only and not to the Issuer or the Issuer's Group.
As of the date of this Prospectus, the Solvency II Group is constituted by the Sampo Group. As further described in "Description o f the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and the Sampo Group

<<<

", the Sampo Group is engaged in non-life insurance, life insurance and banking. The Sampo Group is also one of the largest investors in the Nordic countries. Therefore, the level of own funds, the Solvency Capital Requirement and Minimum Capital

<<<

 Requirement of the Solvency II Group is dependent upon the performance and capital requirements of several other companies in the Solvency II Group, in addition to the Issuer and the Issuer's Group.
Currently, the Solvency II Group is subject

<<<

 to regulation by the Financial Supervisory Authority in Finland (Fi. Finanssivalvonta) and for Solvency II purposes, neither the Issuer nor the Issuer's Group is subject to direct supervision by a national regulatory authority. Individual operating

<<<

 members of the Issuer's Group are subject to direct supervision by national regulatory authorities (see "Regulation - Supervision"). In the event that in the future, the regulatory oversight of the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group changes such

<<<

 that the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group are subject to direct supervision by a national regulatory authority for Solvency II purposes, then pursuant to the terms of the Notes, from such time a Capital Disqualification Event, a Trigger Event

<<<

 or a Regulatory Deficiency Event shall also apply at the level of the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group, which will be a smaller regulatory group than the Solvency II Group.
In the event of any change in the regulatory oversight of the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Issuer's Group, which results in direct supervision of the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group for Solvency II purposes (whether on a solo, group or consolidated basis), the Issuer and/or the Issuer's Group may be required to raise

<<<

 further capital in order to maintain the then applicable Minimum Capital Requirement and Solvency Capital Requirement.
Other capital instruments issued by the Issuer may not absorb losses at the same time, or to the same extent as the Notes

<<<


The terms and conditions of other regulatory capital instruments issued from time to time by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may vary and accordingly such instruments may not be written-down at the same time, or to the same extent, as

<<<

 the Notes, or at all. Further, regulatory capital instruments issued by a member of the Issuer's Group and/or the Solvency Group (as the case may be) with terms that require such instruments to be converted into equity and/or written-down when

<<<

 a solvency or capital measure falls below a certain threshold may have different capital or solvency measures for triggering a conversion or write down to those set out in the definition of Trigger Event or may be determined with respect to

<<<

 a group or sub-group of entities that is different from the Solvency II Group, with the effect that they may not be converted into equity and/or written down on the occurrence of a Trigger Event. Therefore, the Notes may be subject to a greater

<<<

 degree of loss absorption than would otherwise have been the case had such other instruments been written down or converted at the same time as or prior to the Notes.
Risks relating to the Notes generally
Meeting of Noteholders, modification

<<<

 and waivers
The Conditions contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not

<<<

 attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
The Conditions also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, agree to any modification of

<<<

, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, subject to the conditions or any of the provisions set out in the Trust Deed.
Change o f law
The Conditions

<<<

 are based on English and Swedish law in effect as at the date of this Prospectus. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English or Swedish law or administrative practice after the date of

<<<

 this Prospectus.
- 20 -

There is no active trading marketfo r the Notes
The Notes are new securities which may not be widely distributed and for which there is currently no active trading market. If the Notes are traded after their initial

<<<

 issuance, they may trade at a discount to their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and the financial condition of the Issuer or other members of the

<<<

 If Group, or the Solvency II Group. Although applications have been made for the Notes to be admitted to listing on the official list and trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market, there is no assurance that such applications

<<<

 will be accepted or that an active trading market will develop. Accordingly, there is no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Notes.
Floating Rate Notes and interest rate risks
Noteholders should be aware

<<<

 that the floating rate interest income is subject to changes to the 3-months STIBOR and therefore cannot be anticipated. Hence, Noteholders are not able to determine a definite yield of the Notes at the time of purchase, so that their return

<<<

 on investment cannot be compared with that of investments in simple fixed rate instruments.
Since the Margin is fixed at the time of issuance of the Notes, Noteholders are subject to the risk that the Margin does not reflect the spread that

<<<

 investors require in addition to the 3-months STIBOR as a compensation for the risks inherent in the Notes (market spread). The market spread typically changes on a daily basis. As the market spread changes, the price of the Notes changes in

<<<

 the opposite direction. A decrease in the market spread has a positive impact on the price of the Notes; an increase in the market spread has a negative impact on the price of the Notes. However, the price of the Notes is subject to changes

<<<

 in the market spread, changes in the 3-months STIBOR or both. Noteholders should be aware that movements in the market spread can adversely affect the price of the Notes and can lead to losses for the Noteholders.
In addition, Noteholders are

<<<

 exposed to reinvestment risk with respect to proceeds from coupon payments or early redemptions by the Issuer. If the market yield (or market spread respectively) declines, and if Noteholders want to invest such proceeds in comparable transactions

<<<

, Noteholders will only be able to reinvest such proceeds in comparable transactions at the then prevailing lower market yields (or market spreads respectively).
Regulation and reform o f "benchmarks" could adversely affect Notes linked to such

<<<

 "benchmarks"
Rates and indices which are deemed to be "benchmarks" are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective whilst others are still

<<<

 to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on Notes

<<<

 linked to such a "benchmark".
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the "Benchmark Regulation") was published in the official journal on 29 June 2016 and has applied since 1 January 2018. The Benchmark Regulation could have a material impact on Notes

<<<

 linked to a "benchmark" rate or index, in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the "benchmark" are changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmark Regulation, and such changes could (amongst other things) have the effect

<<<

 of reducing or increasing the rate or level, or affecting the volatility of, the published rate or level, of the benchmark. In addition, the Benchmark Regulation stipulates that each administrator of a "benchmark" regulated thereunder must

<<<

 be licensed by the competent authority of the Member State where such administrator is located. There is a risk that administrators of certain "benchmarks" will fail to obtain a necessary licence, preventing them from continuing to provide

<<<

 such "benchmarks". Other administrators may cease to administer certain "benchmarks" because of the additional costs of compliance with the Benchmark Regulation and other applicable regulations, and the risks associated therewith.
In certain

<<<

 circumstances, the ultimate fallback of interest for a particular Interest Period may result in the rate of interest for the last preceding Interest Period being used. This may result in the effective application of a fixed rate for the Notes

<<<

 based on the rate which was last observed on the Relevant Screen Page. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of successor rates and alternative reference rates, the fallback provisions may not operate as intended at

<<<

 the relevant time.
- 21 -

Any such consequences could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Notes. Moreover, any of the above matters or any significant change to the setting or existence of the Rate of Interest could have a

<<<

 material adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Notes. Investors should consider these matters when making their investment decision with respect to the Notes.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks

<<<


The Notes are expected to be rated BB+ by S&P. S&P is established in the European Economic Area and registered under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009, as amended (the "CRA Regulation") and is, as of the date of this Prospectus, included in the

<<<

 list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority on its website (http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certifiedCRAs) in accordance with the CRA Regulation. The rating may not reflect the

<<<

 potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be

<<<

 suspended, revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. Any adverse change in an applicable credit rating could adversely affect the trading price for the Notes. In addition, rating agencies other than S&P could seek to rate the Notes

<<<

 and if such unsolicited ratings are lower than the comparable ratings assigned to the Notes by S&P, those unsolicited ratings could have an adverse effect on the value and the marketability of the Notes.
Taxation
Potential purchasers and sellers

<<<

 of the Notes should be aware that they may be required to pay taxes or documentary charges or duties in accordance with the laws and practices of the jurisdiction where the Notes are transferred to other jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions

<<<

, no official statements of the tax authorities or court decisions may be available for financial instruments such as the Notes. Potential investors cannot rely upon such tax summary contained in this Prospectus but should ask for their own

<<<

 tax adviser's advice on their individual taxation with respect to the subscription, acquisition, holding, disposal and redemption of the Notes. Only this adviser is in a position to duly consider the specific situation of the potential investor

<<<

. This investment consideration has to be read in connection with the taxation sections of this Prospectus.
The proposedfinancial transactions tax (FTT)
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal

<<<

") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (each such Member State, other than Estonia, a "participating M ember State"). However, Estonia has ceased

<<<

 to participate.
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions) where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party

<<<

 is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating

<<<

 Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States and the scope of any such tax is

<<<

 uncertain. It may therefore be altered prior to implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation

<<<

 to the FTT.
Payments on the Notes may be subject to Foreign Account Tax Compliance A ct withholding
Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within Euroclear and Clearstream Luxembourg (together, the "ICSDs" ), in all but the most remote

<<<

 circumstances, it is not expected that the new reporting regime and potential withholding tax imposed by sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") will affect the amount of any payment received by the ICSDs

<<<

. However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding

<<<

. It may also affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary

<<<

 from which it receives payment) with any
- 22 -

information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with

<<<

 care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary

<<<

 to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. Investors should consult their own tax adviser to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has made

<<<

 payment to, or to the order of, the common depositary for the ICSDs (as bearer of the Notes) and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the ICSDs and custodians or intermediaries. Further, foreign

<<<

 financial institutions in a jurisdiction which has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States (an "IGA") are generally not expected to be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) from

<<<

 non-U.S. source payments they make.
OECD base erosion andprofit shifting
In May 2013, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") Council at Ministerial Level adopted a declaration on base erosion and profit shifting

<<<

 urging the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs to develop an action plan to address base erosion and profit shifting in a comprehensive manner and in July 2013 the OECD launched an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, identifying

<<<

 15 specific actions to achieve this (the "BEPS Project"). These action points relate to, amongst other things, restricting the deductibility of interest payments (Action 4), preventing the granting of tax treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances

<<<

 (Action 6) and preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status (Action 7). All of the action points have been subject to public consultation and on 5 October 2015 the OECD Secretariat published 13 final reports and an

<<<

 explanatory statement outlining consensus actions. The BEPS Project is expected to generate changes to tax policy and systems in numerous jurisdictions. However, it is not yet known when the actions will be implemented and which countries will

<<<

 implement them. It is not possible to assess at this stage whether there would be any impact to the tax payable by the If Group or other adverse tax consequences, any of which could reduce amounts available for distribution to Noteholders.

<<<


Exchange rate risks and exchange controls
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in Swedish Krona. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally

<<<

 in a currency or currency unit (the Investor's Currency) other than Swedish Krona. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of Swedish Krona or revaluation of the Investor's Currency

<<<

) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to Swedish Krona would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency

<<<

-equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes (see "RiskFactors - Risks relating to the Issuer - Currency

<<<

 risk").
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or

<<<

 no interest or principal.
Because the Global Notes are held by or on behalfo fEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on their procedures fo r transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will be

<<<

 represented by the Global Notes except in certain limited circumstances described in the Permanent Global Note. The Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in certain limited

<<<

 circumstances described in the Permanent Global Note, investors will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are

<<<

 represented by the Global Notes, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.
The Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to or to the

<<<

 order of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg for distribution to their account holders. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
- 23 -

Clearstream, Luxembourg

<<<

 to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in the Global Notes.

Holders of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will

<<<

 not have a direct right to vote in respect of the Notes. Instead, such holders will be permitted to act only to the extent that they are enabled by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to appoint appropriate proxies.

Independent review and

<<<

 advice

Each prospective investor in the Notes must determine, based on its own independent review and such professional advice as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, that its acquisition of the Notes is fully consistent with its

<<<

 financial needs, objectives and condition, complies and is fully consistent with all investment policies, guidelines and restrictions applicable to it and is a fit, proper and suitable investment for it, notwithstanding the clear and substantial

<<<

 risks inherent in investing in or holding the Notes.

Each prospective investor should consult its own advisers as to legal, tax and related aspects of an investment in the Notes. A prospective investor may not rely on the Issuer or the Joint

<<<

 Lead Managers or any of their respective affiliates in connection with its determination as to the legality of its acquisition of the Notes or as to the other matters referred to above.

The Notes may not be a suitable investmentfo r all investors

<<<



The Notes are complex financial instruments that involve a high degree of risk. Sophisticated institutional investors generally purchase complex financial instruments as part of a wider financial structure rather than as standalone investments

<<<

. They purchase complex financial instruments as a way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless it has

<<<

 the expertise (either alone or with a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's

<<<

 overall investment portfolio.

Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each investor should:

(i)

have sufficient knowledge and experience to

<<<

 make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits

and the risks of investing the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in

this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;

(ii) have access to, and knowledge of

<<<

, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;

(iii) have sufficient financial resources and

<<<

 liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency;

(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes, such

<<<

 as the provisions governing Write Downs and the situations in which interest payments may be cancelled or deemed cancelled, and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and

(v) be able to evaluate (either

<<<

 alone or with the help of a financial advisor) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

Legal investment considerations may restrict certain

<<<

 investments

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether

<<<

 and to what extent (1) the Notes are legal investments for it, (2) the Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Notes. Financial institutions should consult

<<<

 their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES

The following is the text o f the Terms and Conditions o f the Notes (the "Conditions") which (subject to completion

<<<

 and amendment) will be endorsed on each Note in definitive form (if issued):

The SEK 1,000,000,000 Perpetual Floating Rate Restricted Tier 1 Notes (the "Notes", which expression shall in these Conditions, unless the context otherwise requires

<<<

, include any further notes issued pursuant to Condition 15 (Further Issues) and forming a single series with the Notes) of If P&C Insurance Holding Ltd. (the "Issuer") are constituted by a Trust Deed dated 22 March 2018 (the "Trust Deed") made

<<<

 between the Issuer and Citicorp Trustee Company Limited (the "Trustee", which expression shall include its successor(s)) as trustee for the holders of the Notes (the "Noteholders", which expression shall, unless the context otherwise requires

<<<

, include the Couponholders) and the holders of the interest coupons appertaining to the Notes (the "Couponholders" and the "Coupons" respectively, which expressions shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include the talons for further

<<<

 interest coupons (the "Talons") and the holders of the Talons).

The statements in these Conditions include summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed provisions of and definitions in the Trust Deed. Copies of the Trust Deed and the Agency

<<<

 Agreement dated 22 March 2018 (the "Agency Agreement") made between the Issuer, Citibank, N.A., London Branch as principal paying agent (the "Principal Paying Agent", which expression shall include any successor thereto) and the other paying

<<<

 agents appointed thereunder from time to time and any successors thereto (together with the Principal Paying Agent, the "Paying Agents"), Citibank, N.A., London Branch as calculation agent or agent bank (the "Agent Bank", which expression shall

<<<

 include any successor thereto and together with the Principal Paying Agent and the Paying Agents, the "Agents") and the Trustee are available for inspection during normal business hours by the Noteholders and the Couponholders at the specified

<<<

 office of each of the Agents. The Noteholders and the Couponholders are entitled to the benefit of, are bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement applicable to them. Any references

<<<

 in these Conditions to any legislation (whether primary legislation or regulations or other subsidiary legislation made pursuant to primary legislation) shall be construed as a reference to such legislation as the same may have been, or may

<<<

 from time to time be, amended or re-enacted.

1.

Form, Denomination and Title

The Notes are in bearer form, serially numbered, in the denominations of SEK 2,000,000 and integral multiples of SEK 1,000,000, each with Coupons and Talons attached

<<<

 on issue. Notes of one denomination may not be exchanged for Notes of any other denomination. Title to the Notes and to the Coupons will pass by delivery. The Issuer, any Paying Agent and the Trustee may (to the fullest extent permitted by

<<<

 applicable laws) deem and treat the bearer of any Note, principal amount or Coupon as the absolute owner for all purposes (whether or not the Note, principal amount or Coupon shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership thereof

<<<

 or writing thereon, or any notice of loss or theft or of any trust or interest therein) and shall not be required to obtain any proof thereof or as to the identity of such bearer.

2.

Status and Subordination

(a) Status: The Notes and Coupons

<<<

 constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer, conditional as described below, and at all times rank: (i) junior to Senior Creditors; (ii) pari passu without any preference among themselves and among Parity Obligations

<<<

 outstanding from time to time (whether actual or contingent); and (iii) senior to all classes of Junior Obligations.

(b) Subordination: The right to payment in respect of the Notes and the Coupons is subordinated in the event of the Liquidation

<<<

 of the Issuer and (except in the event of the Liquidation of the Issuer) all payments of principal and interest by the Issuer in respect of the Notes and the Coupons are conditional upon the Issuer being Solvent at the time of payment and immediately

<<<

 thereafter (the "Solvency Condition") and (except as aforesaid) no principal or interest shall be payable in respect of the Notes or the Coupons.

The payment of interest on the Notes is also subject to the provisions of Condition 4 (Interest

<<<

 Cancellation).

- 26 -

The provisions of this Condition 2 (Status and Subordination) apply only to the principal and interest in respect of the Notes and nothing in this Condition 2(b) (Subordination) shall affect or prejudice the payment

<<<

 of the costs, charges, expenses, liabilities or remuneration of the Trustee or the rights and remedies of the Trustee in respect thereof.
A certificate as to the solvency of the Issuer signed by two Authorised Signatories shall, in the absence

<<<

 of manifest error, be treated and accepted by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders and all other interested parties as correct and sufficient evidence thereof, shall be binding on all such persons and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely

<<<

 on such certificate without liability to any person.
The Notes do not contribute to a determination that the liabilities of the Issuer exceed its assets; therefore the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, if any, will not contribute to

<<<

 the determination of over-indebtedness.
Any Interest Payment that would have been due and payable but for the operation of this Condition 2(b) (Subordination) shall be cancelled pursuant to Condition 4(b) (Mandatory Interest Cancellation).

<<<


(c) No Set-off: No Holders of Notes or Coupons who shall be indebted to the Issuer shall be entitled to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against moneys owed to the Issuer in respect of such indebtedness.

3.

Interest

(a) Interest

<<<

 Payment Dates: The Notes bear interest on their Prevailing Principal Amount from and including the Issue Date, payable (subject to Condition 4 (Interest Cancellation) below) quarterly in arrear on 22 March, 22 June, 22 September and 22 December

<<<

 in each year commencing on 22 June 2018 (each an "Interest Payment Date"). Any payment of interest in respect of the Notes shall be payable only out of the Issuer's Distributable Items.

If any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on

<<<

 a day which is not a Business Day it shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day unless it would then fall into the next calendar month in which event such Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward to the immediately preceding

<<<

 Business Day.
Whenever it is necessary to compute an amount of interest in respect of the Notes for a period other than an Interest Period, such interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the relevant period divided

<<<

 by 360 and otherwise in accordance with Condition 3(d) (Determination o f Rate o f Interest and Interest Amount) below. The Interest Payment to each Noteholder shall be rounded to the nearest öre, half an öre being rounded upwards, or otherwise

<<<

 in accordance with applicable market convention.
(b) Interest Accrual: Each Note will cease to bear interest from and including its due date for redemption (which due date shall, in the case of suspension of a redemption date in accordance

<<<

 with Condition 7(f) (Conditions to redemption, purchase, substitution and variation), be the latest date to which redemption of the Notes is so suspended) unless, upon due presentation, payment of the principal in respect of the Note is improperly

<<<

 withheld or refused or unless default is otherwise made in respect of payment, in which event interest shall continue to accrue as provided in the Trust Deed.

(c) Interest Rate: The rate of interest payable from time to time in respect of

<<<

 the Notes (the "Rate of Interest") will be determined (subject to Condition 3(h) (Benchmark Replacement)) on the basis of the following provisions:

(i)

the Rate of Interest for the Interest Period shall be the Screen Rate plus the Margin

<<<

.

On each Interest Determination Date, the Agent Bank will determine the Screen

Rate at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on that Interest Determination

Date;

- 27 -

(ii) if the Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will request

<<<

 the principal Stockholm office of each of the Reference Banks to provide the Agent Bank with the rate at which deposits in Swedish Krona are offered by it to prime banks in the Stockholm interbank market for three months at approximately 1

<<<

1.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on the Interest Determination Date in question and for a Representative Amount;
(iii) if at least two of the Reference Banks provide such rates, the Rate of Interest for the Interest Period shall be the arithmetic

<<<

 mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) as established by the Agent Bank of such rates, plus the Margin; and
(iv) if the Rate of Interest cannot be determined in accordance with the above

<<<

 provisions, the Rate of Interest shall be determined as at the last preceding Interest Determination Date.
(d) Determination o fRate o fInterest and Interest Amount: In respect of each Interest Period, the Agent Bank shall, as soon as practicable

<<<

 after 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on each Interest Determination Date determine the Swedish Krona amount (the "Interest Amount") payable in respect of interest on each Note for the relevant Interest Period. The Interest Amount shall be determined

<<<

 by applying the Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount, multiplying the sum by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360, rounding the resultant figure to the nearest öre (half an öre being rounded upwards

<<<

, or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention) and multiplying such rounded figure by a fraction equal to the denomination of such Note divided by the Calculation Amount.
(e) Publication o fRate o f Interest and Interest Amount

<<<

: The Agent Bank shall cause the Rate of Interest and the Interest Amount for each Interest Period and the relevant Interest Payment Date to be notified to the Issuer, the Paying Agents and the Trustee and to any stock exchange or other relevant

<<<

 authority on which the Notes are at the relevant time listed (by no later than the first day of each Interest Period) and to be published in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices) as soon as possible after their determination, and in no event

<<<

 later than the second Business Day thereafter. The Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening

<<<

 of the Interest Period. If the Calculation Amount is less than the minimum denomination, the Agent Bank shall not be obliged to publish each Interest Amount but instead may publish only the Calculation Amount and the Interest Amount in respect

<<<

 of a Note having the minimum denomination.
(f) Notifications, etc. to be final: All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions

<<<

 of this Condition 3 (Interest), whether by the Reference Banks (or any of them), the Agent Bank or the Trustee (or its agent), shall (in the absence of the Reference Banks', the Agent Bank's or the Trustee's, as applicable, own gross negligence

<<<

, fraud or wilful default) be binding on the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agent Bank, the Paying Agents and all Noteholders and Couponholders and (in the absence of the Reference Banks', the Agent Bank's or the Trustee's, as applicable, own gross

<<<

 negligence, fraud or wilful default) no liability to the Issuer, or the Noteholders or the Couponholders shall attach to the Reference Banks (or any of them), the Agent Bank or, if applicable, the Trustee (or its agent) in connection with the

<<<

 exercise or non-exercise by any of them of their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 3 (Interest).
(g) Agent Bank: The Issuer shall procure that, so long as any of the Notes remains outstanding (as defined in the Trust Deed

<<<

), there is at all times an Agent Bank for the purposes of the Notes and the Issuer may, subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee, terminate the appointment of the Agent Bank. In the event of the appointed office of any bank being

<<<

 unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Agent Bank or failing duly to determine the Rate of Interest and the Interest Amount for any Interest Period, the Issuer shall, subject
- 28 -

to the prior written approval of the Trustee, appoint

<<<

 the Stockholm office of another major bank engaged in the Stockholm interbank market to act in its place. The Agent Bank may resign its duties without a successor having been appointed however; such resignation will only take effect upon appointment

<<<

 of a successor. The Agent Bank may not be removed without a successor having been appointed.

(h) Benchmark Replacement: In addition, notwithstanding the provisions in Conditions 3(c) (Interest Rate) or 3(d) (Determination o f Rate o f Interest

<<<

 and Interest Amount) above, if the Screen Rate has ceased to be published on the Relevant Screen Page as a result of such benchmark ceasing to be calculated or administered or the Issuer considers that there may be a Successor Rate (as defined

<<<

 below) when any Rate of Interest (or the relevant component part thereof) remains to be determined by such Screen Rate, (a "Benchmark Event") then the following provisions shall apply:

(i)

the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint

<<<

, as soon as reasonably

practicable, an Independent Adviser to determine, no later than 5 Business Days

prior to the relevant Interest Determination Date relating to the next succeeding

Interest Period (the "IA Determination Cut-off Date

<<<

"), a Successor Rate (as

defined below) or, alternatively, if there is no Successor Rate, an Alternative

Reference Rate (as defined below) for purposes of determining the Rate of

Interest (or the relevant component part thereof) applicable

<<<

 to the Notes;

(ii) if the Issuer is unable to appoint an Independent Adviser, or the Independent Adviser appointed by it fails to determine a Successor Rate or an Alternative Reference Rate prior to the IA Determination Cut-off Date, the Issuer

<<<

 (acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner) may determine a Successor Rate or, if there is no Successor Rate, an Alternative Reference Rate;

(iii) if a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Reference Rate (as

<<<

 applicable) is determined in accordance with the preceding provisions, such Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) shall be the Screen Rate for each of the future Interest Periods (subject to the subsequent

<<<

 operation of, and to adjustment as provided in, this Condition 3(h) (Benchmark Replacement); provided however, that if sub-paragraph (ii) applies and the Issuer is unable to or does not determine a Successor Rate or an Alternative Reference

<<<

 Rate prior to the relevant Interest Determination Date, the Rate of Interest applicable to the next succeeding Interest Period shall be equal to the Rate of Interest last determined in relation to the Notes in respect of the preceding Interest

<<<

 Period (subject, where applicable, to substituting the Margin that applied to such preceding Interest Period for the Margin that is to be applied to the relevant Interest Period); for the avoidance of doubt, the proviso in this sub-paragraph

<<<

 (iii) shall apply to the relevant Interest Period only and any subsequent Interest Periods are subject to the subsequent operation of and to adjustment as provided in, this Condition 3(h) (Benchmark Replacement);

(iv) if the Independent Adviser

<<<

 or the Issuer determines a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) in accordance with the above provisions, the Independent Adviser or the Issuer (as applicable), may also specify changes to these Conditions

<<<

, including but not limited to the Day Count Fraction, Relevant Screen Page, Business Days and/or the Interest Determination Date applicable to the Notes, and the method for determining the fallback rate in relation to the Notes, in order to

<<<

 follow market practice in relation to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable). If the Independent Adviser (in consultation with the Issuer) or the Issuer (as applicable), determines that an Adjustment Spread (as

<<<

 defined below) is required to be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) and determines the quantum of, or a formula or methodology for determining, such Adjustment Spread, then such Adjustment Spread

<<<

 shall be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable). If the Independent Adviser or the Issuer (as applicable) is unable to determine the quantum of, or a formula or methodology for determining, such Adjustment

<<<

 Spread, then such Successor Rate

- 29 -

or Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) will apply without an Adjustment Spread. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and Principal Paying Agent shall, at the request and expense of the Issuer

<<<

, but subject to receipt by the Trustee of the certificate referred to in sub-paragraph (v) below, without the requirement for any consent or approval of the Noteholders, effect such amendments to the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and these

<<<

 Conditions as may be required by the Issuer in order to give effect to this Condition 3(h) (Benchmark Replacement) (such amendments, the "Benchmark Amendments" which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be treated as being within the scope

<<<

 of the Reserved Matters)), provided that the Trustee shall not be obliged so to concur if in the opinion of the Trustee, doing so would impose more onerous obligations upon it or expose it to any additional duties, responsibilities or liabilities

<<<

 or reduce or amend the protective provisions afforded to the Trustee in these Conditions or the Trust Deed (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any supplemental trust deed);

(v) the Issuer shall promptly, following the determination of

<<<

 any Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) and the specific terms of any Benchmark Amendments to these Conditions and/or the Trust Deed, give notice thereof to the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent and the Noteholders

<<<

 in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices). No later than notifying the Trustee of the same, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by two Authorised Signatories (as defined in the Trust Deed) of the Issuer:

(A) confirming

<<<

 (i) that a Benchmark Event has occurred, (ii) the Successor Rate or, as the case may be, Alternative Reference Rate and, (iii) where applicable, the specific terms of any Benchmark Amendments, in each case as determined in accordance with the

<<<

 provisions of this Condition 3(h); and

(B) certifying that the Benchmark Amendments are necessary to ensure the proper operation of such Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate, as the case may be.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely

<<<

 on such certificate (without further enquiry and without liability to any person) as sufficient evidence thereof. The Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) and the Benchmark Amendments (if any) specified in such certificate

<<<

 will (in the absence of manifest error or bad faith in the determination of the Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) and the Benchmark Amendments (if any) and without prejudice to the Trustee's ability to rely on such

<<<

 certificate as aforesaid) be binding on the Issuer, the Trustee, the Calculation Agent, the Paying Agents and the Noteholders.

(vi) any determination to be made by or any changes to the Conditions to be specified by the Independent Adviser

<<<

 or the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of this Condition 3(h) (Benchmark Replacement) shall at all times be made by such Independent Adviser or the Issuer acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner,

provided that the determination

<<<

 of any Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate, and any other related changes to the Notes, shall be made in accordance with the Relevant Rules (if applicable).

4.

Interest Cancellation

(a) Discretionary Interest Cancellation: Without

<<<

 prejudice to Condition 4(b) (Mandatory Interest Cancellation), the Issuer may at any time elect to cancel any Interest Payment in whole or in part, which would otherwise be due and payable on an Interest Payment Date.

(b) Mandatory Interest

<<<

 Cancellation:

- 30 -

(i)

To the extent required by the Relevant Rules from time to time and subject to

Condition 4(b)(ii) below, Interest Payments by the Issuer will be mandatorily

cancelled (in whole or in part (as applicable)) on each

<<<

 Mandatory Interest

Cancellation Date.

(ii) Notwithstanding that an Interest Payment Date may be a Mandatory Interest Cancellation Date, Interest Payments may still be paid on that relevant Interest Payment Date to the extent that:

(A) the

<<<

 Issuer Supervisor has exceptionally waived the cancellation of any such Interest Payments;

(B) such Interest Payments do not further weaken the solvency position of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be

<<<

);

(C) the Minimum Capital Requirement is complied with immediately after such Interest Payments are made; and

(D) the relevant Regulatory Deficiency Event is of the type described in paragraph (i) of the definition of Regulatory Deficiency

<<<

 Event set out in Condition 18 (Definitions).

(iii) At the same time as notifying the Trustee and the Noteholders of a Mandatory Interest Cancellation Date in accordance with Condition 4(d) (Notification in respect o f Interest Payments), the

<<<

 Issuer shall send to the Trustee a certificate signed by two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer confirming that the relevant Interest Payment Date is a Mandatory Interest Cancellation Date. Any such certificate shall, in the absence of manifest

<<<

 error, be treated and accepted by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders and all other interested parties as correct and sufficient evidence thereof, shall be binding on all such persons and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such certificate

<<<

<<<

 time thereafter, and the Noteholders shall have no right thereto (whether in a Liquidation of the Issuer or otherwise) and any such cancellation or non-payment will not constitute a default or an event of default by the Issuer for any purpose

.
If the Issuer does not make an Interest Payment or part thereof on the relevant Interest Payment Date, such non-payment shall evidence the non-payment and cancellation of such Interest Payment (or part thereof) by reason of the Issuer's exercise

 the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or (without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 8 (Taxation)) any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto.

(i)

immediately notify the Issuer Supervisor;

(ii) cancel any interest which is accrued and unpaid up to (and including) the Write Down Date (whether

<<<

 or not such interest has become due for payment);

(iii) by no later than one month (or such other period as the Issuer Supervisor shall require) from the occurrence of the Trigger Event, (without the need for the consent of the Noteholders

<<<

) write down the Notes by reducing the Prevailing Principal Amount to SEK 0.01 (such action a "Write Down" and "Written Down" being construed accordingly), the date on which such Write Down takes effect, the "Write Down Date";

A Write Down

<<<

 of the Notes shall not constitute an event of default in respect of the Notes or a breach of the Issuer's obligations or duties or a failure to perform by the Issuer in any manner whatsoever, and shall not entitle Noteholders to petition for

<<<

 the insolvency or dissolution of the Issuer or to take any other action.

Following a Write Down, Noteholders will be automatically deemed to irrevocably waive their rights to receive, and no longer have any rights against the Issuer with respect

<<<

 to, any principal amount by which the Notes have been Written Down or payment of interest on any principal amount that has been Written Down or cancelled (without prejudice to the rights of Noteholders in respect of any reinstated principal

<<<

 amounts following a Discretionary Reinstatement).

A Trigger Event may occur on one or more occasions and each Note may be Written Down on more than one occasion.

To the extent permitted by the Relevant Rules applicable at the time of the

<<<

 Trigger Event, a Write Down may be exceptionally waived by the Issuer Supervisor to the extent that there is a high likelihood that the tax effects of such Write Down could significantly weaken the solvency position of the Issuer, the Issuer

<<<

's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be).

- 33 -

(b) Write Down Notice: The Issuer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination that a Trigger Event has occurred, and in any event not more than five 

<<<

(5) days following such determination, give notice (which notice shall be irrevocable) to the Noteholders (the "Write Down Notice") in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices), the Trustee and to the Paying Agent stating:

(i)

that the Trigger

<<<

 Event has occurred; and

(ii) the Write Down Date.

Any failure or delay by the Issuer in giving any such notice to the Noteholders referred to under this Condition 6(b) (Write Down Notice) or the notification to the Issuer Supervisor under

<<<

 Condition 6(a) (Write Down) will not in any way impact on the effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any Write Down or give Noteholders any rights as a result of such failure or delay and shall not constitute a default by the Issuer under

<<<

 the Notes or for any purpose.

(c) Discretionary Reinstatement: Following a Write Down, the Issuer may, at its discretion at any time while the Prevailing Principal Amount is less than the Original Principal Amount, elect to reinstate some

<<<

 or all of the principal amount of the Notes, subject to compliance with the Relevant Rules (a "Discretionary Reinstatement") and provided that such Discretionary Reinstatement:

(i)

is permitted only after there is compliance with the Solvency

<<<

 Capital Requirement

by the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be);

(ii) is not implemented by reference to Own Fund Items issued or increased in order to restore compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement

<<<

 of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be);

(iii) occurs only on the basis of profits which contribute to the Issuer's Distributable Items made subsequent to the restoration of compliance with the Solvency

<<<

 Capital Requirement of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group (as the case may be) in a manner that does not undermine the loss absorbency intended by Article 71(5) of the Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35, to the extent

<<<

 such Article is applicable to the Issuer;

(iv) does not result in a Trigger Event;

(v) is not permitted in the situation where an Insolvent Insurer Winding-up has occurred and is continuing;

(vi) will not result in the Prevailing Principal

<<<

 Amount being greater than the Initial Principal Amount; and

(vii) is approved by the Issuer Supervisor, provided that any such approval is required pursuant to the Relevant Rules.

Any Discretionary Reinstatement should be made on a pro rata

<<<

 basis among all Written Down Loss Absorbing Instruments that have been subject to a Write Down. The Issuer will not reinstate the principal amount of any Written Down Loss Absorbing Instrument that has terms permitting a write-up of such principal

<<<

 amount to occur on a similar basis to that set out in respect of the Notes unless it does so on a pro rata basis with a Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes.
A Discretionary Reinstatement may occur on more than one occasion. A Discretionary

<<<

 Reinstatement shall be operated at the sole and absolute discretion of the Issuer and there shall be no obligation for the Issuer to operate or accelerate a Discretionary Reinstatement in any circumstance.

- 34 -

To the extent that the Prevailing

<<<

 Principal Amount of the Notes has been reinstated as described above, interest shall accrue on such increased Prevailing Principal Amount in accordance with these conditions as from the date of the relevant Discretionary Reinstatement and 

<<<

(for the avoidance of doubt) such interest shall be subject to Condition 4 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 6 (Principal Loss Absorption).

(d) Notice o f Discretionary Reinstatement: In the event of a Discretionary Reinstatement in accordance

<<<

 with Condition 6(c) (Discretionary Reinstatement), the Issuer will give notice to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices) and to the Trustee and the Paying Agent not more than ten (10) days following the day on which it resolves

<<<

 to effect such Discretionary Reinstatement, which notice shall specify the date on which such Discretionary Reinstatement will be effected.

<<<

 specified in the notice of redemption by the Issuer under Conditions 7(b) (Redemption at the Option o f the Issuer) or 7(c) (Special Event redemption), as a result of the operation of Condition 7(f) (Conditions to redemption, purchase, substitution

<<<

 Prevailing Principal Amount together with any other accrued and unpaid interest (in each case to the extent that such payments have not previously been cancelled pursuant to these Conditions), upon the earliest of:
(A) the date falling ten

<<<

 of Regulatory Deficiency Event to the extent waived under Conditions 7(g) (Exceptional Waiver o f Regulatory Pre-Conditions)) in which case the provisions of Condition 7(f)(i) to 7(f)(v) (Conditions to redemption, purchases, substitution and

(i) of the definition of Regulatory Deficiency Event;

(ii) the Issuer Supervisor has exceptionally waived the suspension of redemption or as the case may be, purchase of the Notes;

shall be automatically rescinded and shall be of no force and effect. Accordingly, the Notes

will not be redeemed, purchased, substituted or varied on the

Trustee role on redemption, purchase, variation or substitution: Trustee not obliged to

monitor: The Trustee shall not be obliged to co-operate in or agree to any such substitution

or variation of the terms

<<<

 referred to in this Condition 7 (Redemption, Purchase,

Substitution and Variation) if the securities into which the Notes are to be substituted or

are to be varied or such substitution or variation imposes, in the Trustee's opinion, more

<<<



onerous obligations or duties upon it or exposes it to liabilities or reduces its protections.

If the Trustee does not so co-operate or agree as provided above, the Issuer may instead,

subject as provided above, redeem the Notes as provided

<<<

 above.

The Trustee shall not be under any duty to monitor whether any event or circumstance has happened or exists for the purposes of this Condition 7 (Redemption, Purchase, Substitution and Variation) and will not be responsible to the Noteholders

<<<

 for any loss arising from any failure by it to do so. Unless and until the Trustee has written notice of the occurrence of any event or circumstance within this Condition 7 (Redemption, Purchase, Substitution and Variation), it shall be entitled

<<<

 to assume that no such event or circumstance exists.

(k) Replacement Solicitation: If a Capital Disqualification Event has occurred, and to the extent that the Notes are not otherwise as a result of such Capital Disqualification Event called

<<<

 or redeemed pursuant to Condition 7(c) (Special Event redemption), the Issuer shall, (i) promptly appoint an Independent Agent, and, (ii) with the advice and assistance of the Independent Agent, and, as soon as reasonably practicable but in

<<<

 any event no later than 12 months from the Capital Disqualification Event occurring, solicit interest from new investors for the purchase and subscription of Replacement Securities (the "Replacement Solicitation"), provided that no Market Disruption

<<<

 Event has occurred and subject to the Relevant Rules.

If, following the Replacement Solicitation and subject to Condition 7(f) (Conditions to redemption, purchase, substitution and variation) and the Regulatory Pre-Conditions, the Issuer would

<<<

, using its best efforts and with the advice and assistance of the Independent Agent, be able to proceed with the issuance of the Replacement Securities on terms that do not materially weaken the income capacity of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group

<<<

 and the Solvency II Group and which are consistent with the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and the Solvency II Group's medium-term capital plan, the Issuer shall issue the Replacement Securities and redeem the Notes at a price equal to their Prevailing

<<<

 Principal Amount together with any accrued interest and unpaid interest in respect thereof up to (but excluding) the redemption date (other than interest which has been cancelled in accordance with the provisions of Condition 4 (Interest Cancellation

<<<

)) out of the proceeds of such issuance.

If, despite using its best efforts, the Issuer would not be able, within 12 months of the Capital Disqualification Event occurring, to proceed with such issuance of Replacement

- 38 -

Securities on

<<<

 such terms, the Issuer will thereafter continue to conduct periodical Replacement Solicitations, provided no Market Disruption Event shall have occurred and subject to applicable laws and regulations, until such time as the Issuer would, using

<<<

 its best efforts and with the advice and assistance of the Independent Agent, be able to proceed with the issuance of Replacement Securities on terms that do not materially weaken the income capacity of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and the

<<<

 Solvency II Group which are consistent with the Issuer, the Issuer's Group's and the Solvency II Group's medium-term capital plan and in an aggregate amount which would enable the Issuer to redeem the Notes in full. At such time, subject to

<<<

 Condition 7(f) (Conditions to redemption, purchase, substitution and variation) and the Regulatory Pre-Conditions, the Issuer shall issue the Replacement Securities and redeem the Notes at an amount equal to their Prevailing Principal Amount

<<<

 together with any accrued interest and unpaid interest in respect thereof up to (but excluding) the redemption date (other than interest which has been cancelled in accordance with the provisions of Condition 4 (Interest Cancellation)) out

<<<

 of the proceeds of such issuance or issuances.

Subject and without prejudice to Condition 7(f) (Conditions to redemption, purchase, substitution and variation), any notice of redemption in respect of a Special Event or pursuant to Condition

<<<

 7(d) (Substitution and Variation) shall, except in the circumstances described in Condition 7(i) (Trigger Event following notice of redemption, purchase, substitution or variation), be irrevocable and on the date of redemption, substitution

<<<

 or variation (as applicable) specified in such notice, the Issuer shall be bound to redeem, or as the case may be, vary or substitute the Notes in accordance with the terms of the relevant Condition.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer

<<<

 may not give a notice of redemption, purchase, variation or substitution of the Notes pursuant to Condition 12 (Notices) if a Write Down Notice has been given. If a Write Down Notice is given after a notice of redemption has been given by the

<<<

 Issuer but before the relevant redemption date, such notice of redemption shall be null and void and the relevant redemption shall not be made.

Taxation

(a) Payment without Withholding: All payments in respect of the Notes by or on behalf

<<<

 of the Issuer shall be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Relevant Jurisdiction, unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required by

<<<

 law. In that event, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Noteholders and Couponholders after the withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts which would

<<<

 have been receivable in respect of the Notes or, as the case may be, Coupons in the absence of the withholding or deduction; except that no additional amounts shall be payable in relation to any payment in respect of any Note or Coupon ("Additional

<<<

 Amounts"):

(iii) presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note or Coupon to another

<<<

 Paying Agent in a Member State of the European Union; or

(iv) presented for payment more than thirty (30) days after the Relevant Date except to the extent that a holder would have been entitled to additional amounts on presenting the same

<<<

 for payment on the last day of the period of thirty (30) days assuming, whether or not such is in fact the case, that day to have been a Presentation Date (as defined in Condition 5(e) (Payment only on a Presentation Date)).

- 39 -

(b) Additional

<<<

 Amounts: Any reference in these Conditions to any amounts in respect of the Notes and/or Coupons shall be deemed also to refer to any additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition 8 (Taxation) or under any undertakings given

<<<

 presented for payment within periods of ten (10) years (in the case of principal) and five (5) years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date in respect of the Notes or, as the case may be, the Coupons, subject to the provisions of

<<<

 Condition 5 (Payments and Exchanges of Talons). There shall not be included in any Coupon sheet issued upon exchange of a Talon any Coupon which would be void upon issue under this Condition 9 (Prescription) or Condition 5 (Payments and Exchanges

<<<

(a) Enforcement by the Trustee: The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such proceedings and/or other action as it may think fit against or in relation

<<<

 to the Issuer to recover any amounts due in respect of the Notes (other than any payment obligation of the Issuer under or arising from the Notes or the Trust Deed or in respect of any damages awarded for breach of any obligation thereunder

<<<

) which are unpaid or to enforce its rights under the Trust Documents (as defined in the Trust Deed). The Trustee shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action in relation to the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons unless

<<<

 (a) it has been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least onequarter in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and (b) it has been indemnified and/or secured

<<<

 and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction against all liabilities to which it may thereby render itself liable or which it may incur by so doing and provided that the Trustee shall not be liable for the consequences of taking any such action and

<<<

 may take such action without having regard to the effect of such actions on individual Noteholders or Couponholders.

(b) Liquidation: In the case of the Liquidation of the Issuer, any Noteholder may prove or claim in such proceedings in respect

<<<



1.

The Temporary

<<<

 Global Note will be exchangeable, in whole or in part, for interests in a separate permanent global note (the "Permanent Global Note") not earlier than 40 days after the Issue Date of the Notes upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership

<<<

.

The Permanent Global Notes will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for Definitive Notes only if one of the following events (each an "Exchange Event") occurs:

(a) either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg

<<<

<<<

 to the Trustee is available; or

(b) the Issuer would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation or otherwise) or as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which

<<<

 would not be suffered were the Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two (2) Directors is given to the Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of paragraph (a) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting on

<<<

 the instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Issuer and (in the case of paragraph (b) above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the Noteholders of its intention to

<<<

<<<

 Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent. In exchange for the Permanent Global Note the Issuer will deliver, or procure the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of, an equal aggregate principal amount of Definitive

<<<

 is located.

So long as the Notes are represented by the Temporary Global Note or the Permanent Global Note and the relevant clearing system(s) so permit, the Notes will be tradeable only in the minimum authorised denomination of SEK 2,000

<<<

,000, notwithstanding that no Definitive Notes will be issued with a denomination above SEK 2,000,000.

<<<

 of interest on the Temporary Global Note (if permitted by the first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUER, THE ISSUER'S GROUP AND THE SAMPO GROUP
The Issuer
If P&C Insurance Holding Ltd (publ) (the "Issuer" and, together with its subsidiaries, the "If Group" or "If") (registered

<<<

 under the Swedish name "If Skadeförsäkring Holding AB (publ)") is the Swedish insurance holding company of the If Group. The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated on 25 January 1984 under the laws of, and registered in,

<<<

 Sweden with corporate registration number 556241 7559. The registered offices of the Issuer are in Stockholm, Sweden (visiting address: Barks väg 15, postal address: SE-106 80 Stockholm, Tel: +46 771 43 00 00).
The main role of the Issuer is

<<<

 to manage shares in wholly-owned property and casualty ("P&C") insurance operations as well as other significant holdings. The Issuer does not conduct any insurance operations. Beginning in September 2017, the Issuer has managed parts of the

<<<

 cash surplus in an investment portfolio of its own. On 31 December 2017, this investment portfolio amounted to SEK 2,932 million, consisting of 100 per cent. fixed income instruments. The Issuer is also the main account holder for an If Group

<<<

 cash pool account system comprising the major part of the flow of liquid funds from the insurance operations of the If Group. Underlying flows give rise to intra-group transactions within the Issuer's balance sheet. Intra group transactions

<<<

 also arise in connection with dividend payments from subsidiaries which are not passed on or invested outside of the If Group. On 31 December 2017, the Issuer had tier 2 subordinated debt of SEK 1,989 million outstanding.
The Issuer is a wholly

<<<

 owned subsidiary of Sampo plc (together with its subsidiaries, "Sampo Group"), a Finnish company listed on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki. Sampo plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Finland. Its registered office and headquarters

<<<

 are in Helsinki, Finland.
Sampo Group
History
Currently, Sampo Group's main business areas include P&C insurance and life insurance. Sampo Group divested its 100 per cent. owned banking business in 2007 by selling the Sampo Bank Group to Danske

<<<

 Bank A/S.
The roots of Sampo Group's P&C insurance business reach back to the 18th century and its life insurance business dates back to the 19th century. At the beginning of 2002, the P&C insurance operations of Sampo Group were combined with

<<<

 the Issuer. Through this transaction and two other transactions, the Issuer became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sampo plc.
During recent years, Sampo Group has, through the Issuer, also increased its shareholdings in the Danish insurer, Topdanmark

<<<

 A/S ("Topdanmark"). The Issuer's holding in Topdanmark exceeded 20 per cent. in May 2011 and Topdanmark was recorded as an associated company in If Group's accounts as well as in Sampo Group's accounts from 16 May 2011 until 7 September 20

<<<

16.
In September 2016, Sampo Group restructured its ownership in Topdanmark. In the period from 6 September 2016 to 7 September 2016, Sampo plc acquired 200,000 additional Topdanmark shares in the market and thereby caused Sampo Group to cross

<<<

 the applicable Danish threshold of one-third of the total outstanding voting rights of Topdanmark. In connection with this, Sampo plc also acquired 31,476,920 Topdanmark shares, representing approximately 33.13 per cent. of the entire issued

<<<

 share capital and voting rights of Topdanmark (including treasury shares), from the Issuer. Following Sampo plc's acquisition of the Issuer's shareholding in Topdanmark, the Issuer no longer holds any shares in Topdanmark.
As a result, Sampo

<<<

 plc announced an obligation to make a mandatory offer to the shareholders of Topdanmark (the "M andatory Offer") on 7 September 2016. The offer period of the Mandatory Offer commenced on 27 September 2016 and expired on 25 October 2016. The

<<<

 cash price offered in the Mandatory Offer was DKK 183 for each Topdanmark share. Sampo plc received acceptance from shareholders in Topdanmark representing 7,374,306 shares, corresponding to approximately 7.76 per cent. of the entire issued

<<<

 share capital and voting rights in Topdanmark (including Topdanmark's holding of treasury shares). Following completion of the offer, Sampo plc held 41.11 per cent. of the entire issued share capital and all voting rights in Topdanmark.
- 

<<<

56 -

During 2017, Sampo plc continued to acquire Topdanmark shares and on 30 September 2017 Sampo plc held 41,997,070 Topdanmark shares. Taking into consideration the treasury shares held by Topdanmark, Sampo plc's share of voting rights was

<<<

 49.1 per cent. at that date. Prior to 30 September 2017, Topdanmark was recorded as an associated company in Sampo Group's accounts. In accordance with IFRS, Sampo plc has since gained control of Topdanmark and Topdanmark has been consolidated

<<<

 as a subsidiary in the financial reporting of Sampo Group from 30 September 2017 onwards.

Sampo plc is also the largest shareholder in the Nordic banking group, Nordea Bank AB (publ) (''Nordea'') with a holding of 21.2 per cent. as of 31 December

<<<

 2017. Sampo plc's holding in Nordea exceeded 20 per cent. in December 2009 and since 2010 Nordea has been recorded as an associated company in Sampo Group's accounts.

In connection with the acquisition of Sampo's banking operations by Danske

<<<

 Bank A/S in early 2007, Sampo Bank plc (now Danske Bank Plc), and Sampo Life Insurance Company Ltd (now Mandatum Life Insurance Company Ltd) signed an agency agreement that guaranteed Sampo Life the exclusive right to sell life and pension

<<<

 insurance products through Danske Bank's branch network in Finland. In October 2016, Mandatum Life Insurance Company Ltd announced that it would not be continuing its insurance agency agreement with Danske Bank A/S after 31 December 2016 and

<<<

 that it would exercise its right to sell the insurance portfolio that had been generated through the agency agreement to Danske Bank. The valuation process was finalised in June 2017 and the value of the insurance portfolio as at 31 December

<<<

 2016 was determined to be EUR 334 million less theoretical results from 1 January 2017 to the date of completion of the sale. The transfer of the portfolio is expected to take place during 2018. The sales gain is taxable under Finnish tax law

<<<

. The transaction will have a positive impact on Mandatum Life's solvency position.

Capital position and Solvency The Sampo Group regulatory capital requirements and own funds are calculated under both the Solvency II Directive and Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 200

2 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate (the "Conglomerate Directive"). However, for the purposes of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, only the regulatory

<<<

Sampo Group ratio o f eligible ownfunds to group SCR

Sampo Group's own funds for deriving its ratio of eligible own funds to group SCR are calculated from

<<<

 its consolidated Solvency II balance sheet. Asset and liabilities are valued in accordance with article 75 of the Solvency II Directive. This means that the values are determined at the amount for which the assets could be exchanged and the

<<<

 liabilities could be transferred or settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction (i.e. on an economic value basis). Transitional measures are applied on Mandatum Life's Technical Provisions in respect of original

<<<

 pension policies with 3.5 per cent. and 4.5 per cent. guarantee rates. Also, the volatility adjustment is applied when calculating Mandatum Life's Technical Provisions. Topdanmark applies a volatility-adjusted Solvency II interest rate curve

<<<

 as well when calculating its Technical Provisions.

The Sampo Group group SCR is calculated through two phases:

(i)

The capital requirement of risks other than foreign exchange-risk and concentration risk are

calculated for the consolidated

<<<

 group including the respective standard formula SCRs of the parent

company Sampo plc, If Group, Mandatum Life and Topdanmark and its subsidiaries (the

"Topdanm ark Group"). The company SCRs may include simplifications and other options as

<<<



applied by them. The capital requirement for foreign exchange-risk and concentration risks are

calculated based on group-wide exposures calculated separately for this purpose. With respect to

the capital requirement for foreign exchange

<<<

-risk, translation risk exposures related to the SEK-

denominated equity of the If Group and the DKK-denominated equity of the Topdanmark Group

are also taken into account. A diversified capital requirement for the consolidated group SCR is

<<<



then calculated from these risk-specific SCRs.

(ii) Sampo plc's portion of Nordea's capital requirement is added to the consolidated group's capital requirement. Mandatum Life's capital requirement for other financial sectors is added as

<<<

 well.

Transitional measures are used for equity risk when calculating the Sampo Group group SCR. The Sampo Group group SCR accounts for diversification within the consolidated insurance group only and thus excludes the diversification effects

<<<

 of Nordea. Nordea is included in Sampo Group's ratio of eligible own funds to group SCR as an associated undertaking according to sectoral rules. As of 31 December 2017, the Sampo Group ratio of eligible own funds to group SCR was 156 per cent

<<<

.

Nordea's capital requirement in Sampo Group's solvency changed with effect from 1 January 2018 due to the expiration of the Basel I floor in Sweden. Until 31 December 2017, Sampo's share of Nordea's capital requirement was based on the minimum

<<<

 requirement including the Basel I floor, but as of 1 January 2018, Sampo has started to use Minimum Capital Requirement for Own funds including Capital Buffers (as defined in Nordea's quarterly Factbook) as the capital requirement in Sampo

<<<

 Groups' solvency. At the end of 2017, this change would have increased Sampo's Group SCR by approximately EUR 380 million. As of 31 December 2017, the ratio of eligible own funds to Sampo Group group SCR would have been 148 per cent. taking

<<<

 the new Minimum Capital Requirement for Own funds (14.3 per cent.) into account.

Sampo Group ratio o f eligible ownfunds to minimum consolidated group SCR

Sampo Group's own funds for deriving its ratio of eligible own funds to minimum consolidated

<<<

 group SCR is calculated from the consolidated Solvency II balance sheet excluding holdings in associated company Nordea. The Sampo Group minimum consolidated group SCR is the sum of minimum capital requirements ("MCR") of all the individual

<<<

 insurance companies of the If Group, Topdanmark Group and Mandatum Life only. As of 31 December 2017, the Sampo Group ratio of eligible own funds to minimum consolidated group SCR was 288 per cent.

As there is no concept of a minimum capital

<<<

 requirement on a group basis, in accordance with article 331(2)(b) of the Solvency II Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, the MCR applicable to the Sampo Group refers to the minimum consolidated group SCR.

Conglomerate Directive
According to the Conglomerate Directive, Sampo Group's total minimum requirement for own funds is the sum of the separate sub-group's requirements (sectoral rules) and the parent company's

<<<

 requirement (banking rules) for the solvency capital. The Conglomerate capital requirement does not take into account any diversification between the sub-groups. For own funds, the starting point is the consolidated group equity. The sectoral

 items are added to group equity and the intangibles and other Deductibles are subtracted from it. As of 31 December 2017, the Sampo Group Conglomerate solvency ratio was 154 per cent. (31 December 2016: 154 per cent.).
If Group
History
The

<<<

 If Group's P&C insurance business is centred around the Nordic (specifically Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish) insurance markets. The current operations of the Issuer and If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) in Sweden were formed in March 199

<<<

9, through the merger of the P&C insurance operations of Försäkringsaktiebolaget Skandia (publ) in Sweden and Storebrand ASA in Norway. In January 2002, the P&C insurance operations of the Sampo Group were acquired by the Issuer.
The following

<<<

 insurance companies (also shown in the structure chart on page 58) are wholly-owned by the Issuer: If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) and If Livförsäkring AB in Sweden (the latter company having been acquired from Sampo in 2008) and If P&C Insurance

<<<

 AS in Estonia. In October 2017, the If Group structure was consolidated through the merger of If P&C Insurance Company Ltd (Finland) and If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ).
The If Group's operations in Denmark, Norway, Finland, and to a limited extent

<<<

 in Estonia and Latvia, are conducted via branches of If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) in each country. In addition, If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) has branch offices in France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany to support customers with

<<<

 international operations. The Estonian company If P&C Insurance AS also conducts operations in Latvia and Lithuania via branches.

Vision and Strategy

The If Group's vision is to offer insurance solutions that provide customers with

<<<

 security and stability in their daily lives and business operations with such excellence that the If Group is the preferred insurance provider in the Nordic and Baltic markets - expressed through the customer promise: "Relax, we'll help you

<<<

".

In order to fulfil this vision, the If Group has adopted a strategy based on three goals:

·

Most satisfied customers through strong focus on customer value

·

To achieve this, the If Group must have the best in-depth understanding of

<<<

 its customers'

insurance needs and, correspondingly, the best Underwriting skills. The If Group strives

to be the most service-oriented company in the industry and continues to develop its digital

communication.

·

Europe's most professional

<<<

 and innovative P&C insurance people

·

The If Group continues to strengthen its Underwriting competencies within the "Best in

Risk" concept. The concept focuses on understanding all aspects of risk management,

including product, pricing

<<<

 and risk quality, throughout the organisation.

·

Stable profitability through Underwriting excellence and operational efficiency

·

Profitability of the core business by accurate pricing of risk. Continuous focus on cost

efficiency, an

<<<

 investment strategy based on balanced risk and creditworthiness also

contribute to a strong and stable profitability.

The If Group's financial targets are to achieve a long-term Return on Equity of at least 17.5 per cent. (after tax) through

<<<

 a Combined Ratio of less than 95 per cent.

Business overview

The If Group is one of the leading insurers in Sweden, Norway and Finland with market shares of 18 per cent., 21 per cent. and 22 per cent. respectively6. In the Danish market,

<<<

 the If Group (not including Sampo's share in Topdanmark) is the sixth largest insurer (by market share) with a market share of 6 per cent7. The If Group also commands a strong position in the Baltic insurance markets, holding approximately

<<<

 11 per cent. of the total market8. In the relatively consolidated Estonian P&C insurance market, the If Group is the largest insurer with a market share of 22 per cent.9 . In Latvia and Lithuania, where markets are more fragmented, the If Group

<<<

 is the fifth largest P&C insurer, with a market share of 8 per cent. in Latvia10 and 7 per cent. in Lithuania11.

The Nordic P&C insurance market is relatively consolidated. The four largest players account for approximately 70 to 90 per cent

<<<

. of the markets in Norway, Finland and Sweden (by market share) and many are established in more than one Nordic country. In Denmark, the market is less consolidated. O f the six leading Nordic P&C insurers, two are mutually owned and the rest

<<<

 are publicly traded (the If Group through Sampo plc).

Since the beginning of the year 2000, the Nordic P&C market has generally experienced good profitability. The low interest rate environment has become the new normal for the P&C insurance

<<<

 industry, producing lower rates of return on insurers' investment portfolios. As a result, the industry's focus on Underwriting profitability has, in general, increased during the past years and at the same time competition remains

Technical Provisions

<<<

 (Reserves) Premiums are paid in advance, hence it is necessary to set provisions for premiums not yet earned. Furthermore, claims are paid after they have occurred, so it is also necessary to set aside provisions for claims not yet paid. The

 Technical Provisions are the sum of provisions for premiums not yet earned and provisions for claims not yet paid. Technical Provisions include an inherent degree of uncertainty as such provisions represent an estimate of the size and the frequency

<<<

 of future claims payments. The uncertainty of Technical Provisions is normally greater for new portfolios for which complete run-off statistics are not yet available, and for portfolios that include claims which take a long time to settle which

 include (but are not limited to) products relating to workers' compensation, motor third party liability, personal accident and liability insurance. The If Group's gross Technical Provisions as at 31 December 2017 were SEK 89,775 million (SEK

 gross Technical Provisions by SEK 16 million. The If Group's Technical Provisions are, with the exception of annuity related provisions, reported with undiscounted values in the IFRS accounts. Reinsurance is bought to balance the relationship

The Duration of the provisions, and thus the sensitivity to changes in interest rates, varies with each product portfolio

. The weighted average Duration for 2017 across all product portfolios was 6.5 years.

Anticipated movements in inflation are taken into account when calculating all such provisions and are of particular importance for claims settled over a

 long period of time. The anticipated trend is calculated based on external assessments of the movements in inflation in various areas, such as the consumer price index and payroll index, combined with the If Group's own evaluation of cost increases

 for various types of claims cost.

As at 31 December 2017, gross provisions for claims outstanding amounted to SEK 69,815 million for the If Group (SEK 70,095 million at the end of December 2016). Net provisions for claims outstanding amounted

<<<

 to SEK 68,045 million (SEK 68,263 million at the end of December 2016). Reserve ratios (the provision for claims outstanding for own account in relation to either (i) paid claims for own account, or (ii) in relation to premiums written for

<<<

 own account) remained strong and were 162 per cent. of net written premiums and 233 per cent. of claims paid as at 31 December 2017.

Risk Management System

The If Group has an effective Risk Management System comprising strategies, processes

<<<

 and reporting procedures which are necessary to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report potential or actual risks on a continuous basis at an individual and aggregated level and their interdependencies. The Risk Management function facilitates

<<<

 the implementation and development of the Risk Management System within the If Group.

The Risk Management System is part of the larger internal control system and is linked with the If Group Risk Management System, ensuring that all risks

<<<

 are managed from a legal entity perspective as well as from a group-wide perspective.

The objectives of the Risk Management System are to create value for the If Group's stakeholders by securing its long-term solvency, minimising the risk

<<<

 of unexpected financial loss and giving input to business decisions by taking into account the effect on risk and capital.

A high quality risk management process is a prerequisite for running the business and for assuring stable results and

<<<

 the delivery of long-term returns.

Risk Management Strategy

The If Group's risk management strategy is part of the governing principles for its operations. The Risk Management policy defines the overall risk strategy and risk appetite for

<<<

 the business. The risk management strategies comprises:

·

ensuring a sound and well established risk culture;

·

ensuring that risks affecting the profit and loss account and the balance sheet are identified,

assessed, managed, monitored

<<<

 and reported;·

·

ensuring that the riskiness of the insurance business is reflected in the pricing;

- 71 -

·

ensuring adequate long-term investment returns within set risk levels;

·

ensuring that risk buffers - in the form of capital

<<<

 and foreseeable profitability - are adequate in

relation to the current risks in business activities and external risks;

·

limiting fluctuations in the economic values of group companies; and

·

ensuring the overall efficiency, security

<<<

 and continuity of operations.

The Risk Appetite Framework

The If Group's risk appetite framework defines the boundaries for what risk the If Group is willing to accept in the pursuit of its objectives and includes the risk appetite statement

<<<

, risk tolerances, capital adequacy, steering documents, processes, controls, and systems through which the risk appetite is established, communicated and monitored.

The risk appetite framework, the risk profile and the status of the If Group

<<<

's capital are analysed and reported in the quarterly risk and solvency assessment process which includes analysis o f the capital adequacy and regulatory capital requirements under various risk scenarios. Consequently, the process influences

<<<

 the If Group's capital management, business planning and product development and design.

Responsibilities within the Risk Management System

The Board of Directors

The Board of Directors is the corporate body with overall responsibility for

<<<

 internal control and ensuring that the If Group has appropriate risk management systems and processes in place. The Board of Directors approve the Risk Management Policy and other risk related policies, receives risk reporting from the Risk

<<<

 Management function as well as from the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and has an active role in the forward-looking own risk and solvency assessment ("ORSA") process.

CEO

The CEO is responsible for organising and overseeing the daily business

<<<

 activities in accordance with instructions and guidelines from the Board of Directors. The CEO has the ultimate responsibility for the effective implementation of the Risk Management System by ensuring appropriate Risk Management set up and

<<<

 promoting the sound risk culture within If.

Risk committees

There are separate committees in place for key risk areas. It is the responsibility of these committees to monitor the management and control of risks as decided by the Board of

<<<

 Directors. The chairmen of the risk committees are responsible for reporting to the ORSA committee. None of the committees have any decision-making mandate.

The ORSA committee assists the CEO in fulfilling the responsibility of overseeing

<<<

 the risk and risk management system. The ORSA committee reviews the effectiveness of the If Group's internal control and gives input to, and follows up on coordination of efforts and actions relating to these areas. The committee receives analysis

<<<

 and reporting on risks to the If Group. The ORSA committee further supervises the If Group's and its subsidiaries' solvency position, monitoring that both the short-term and long-term aggregated risk profile is in line with the risk strategy

<<<

, risk appetite and capital requirements.

Risk Management Function

The risk management function is responsible for coordinating the risk management activities on behalf of the Board of Directors and the CEO. The function is headed by the Chief

<<<

 Risk Officer ("CRO"). Units within the risk management function are operationally independent, and therefore not part of the governance of, or the decision making process in, the operations of the If Group's licensed activities.

- 72 -

Line

<<<

 organisation

The line organisation (business areas and corporate functions) has the day-to-day responsibility of managing risks within the limits and restrictions set by the risk policies, guidelines and instructions and shall ensure that

<<<

 it has resources and tools in place. On behalf of the heads of the business areas/corporate functions, a risk coordination structure is established within the first line of defence.

The line organisation has an obligation to inform the risk

<<<

 management function of material risks relevant for the performance of their duties.

Implementation o f the Risk Management System

The risk committee structure together with the coordination network ensures that there are efficient processes

<<<

 and routines in place with clear ownership to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report all material risks and that they are reported according to the If Group's reporting structure.

Risks identified within the Risk Management System,

<<<

 especially those measured through the internal model, are observed in important business decisions such as the yearly financial plan, investment allocation, Reinsurance programmes and possible new business opportunities.

Capital management

<<<



The Risk management function focuses on both capital efficiency and maintaining the capital resources of the If Group and its subsidiaries at an appropriate level in relation to the risks taken. At a minimum, this means ensuring that the available

<<<

 capital exceeds capital requirements which are set according to requirements of third parties such as regulators and rating agencies.

Capital management approach

One purpose of capital is to act as a buffer against future losses. It is therefore

<<<

 appropriate to define risk in terms of capital. The starting point for capital management is the risk tolerance implemented through a framework of risk limits, policies and authorisations, approved by the Board of Directors. Risks are continuously

<<<

 monitored and the implications of such risks on the available capital of the If Group and its subsidiaries are assessed. The risk exposures, required capital and available capital are reported to the ORSA committee and the Board of Directors

<<<

 on a quarterly basis by the CRO, or more often if the situation so requires. The policy of the If Group, in addition to maintaining capital resources at a sufficient level, is to:

·

retain at least a single "A" (or equivalent) rating from

<<<

 each of Standard & Poor's Credit Market

Services ("S&P") and Moody's Investors Service Limited ("Moody's");·

·

ensure that risk buffers - in the form of capital and foreseeable profitability - are adequate in

relation to the current risks

<<<

 inherent in its business activities and existing market environment;

·

maintain a sustainable dividend capacity;

·

manage the debt-to-equity ratio in order to enhance returns to shareholders while maintaining

sufficient financial flexibility

<<<

;

·

support growth in profitable businesses by allocating capital efficiently; and

·

ensure the overall efficiency, security and continuity of operations.

Capital position and Solvency

The If Group monitors its capital position by reference

<<<

 to the relationship between available capital and required capital. To fulfil the differing requirements of various third parties (including but not limited to, regulators and rating agencies), the If Group uses different measures to describe

<<<

 its capital position, namely regulatory measures, internal capital measures and rating agency measures.

- 73 -

Regulatory measures

The Solvency II Directive, implemented on 1 January 2016, introduces a regulatory framework where solvency

<<<

 capital requirements and own funds are risk-based and based on economic valuation principles. Due to the rules related to group supervision within Solvency II, the group solvency capital requirement is calculated at the level of the Sampo Group

<<<

. From a regulatory point of view, as at the date of this Prospectus, the If Group is not supervised as a group under Solvency II and hence solvency capital requirements are only subject to regulatory supervision on a solo level with respect

<<<

 to each operating insurance company within the If Group. However, the balance sheet and operations of the If Group contribute significantly to the consolidated group solvency capital requirement at the Sampo Group level. The Solvency II standard

<<<

 formula including the equity transitional rule is applied for all subsidiaries of the If Group in calculating their solvency capital requirements and minimum capital requirements, except If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) which utilises a partial

<<<

 internal model for the main Underwriting risks and the standard formula with the equity transitional rule for other risks. The partial internal model was approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw. Finansinspektionen) in November

<<<

 2016. In October 2017, the operations in If P&C Insurance Company Ltd (Finland) were merged into If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ), and If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) filed as a part of the merger an application to include the insurance operations from

<<<

 If P&C Insurance Company Ltd (Finland) into the partial internal model for Underwriting risks. In February 2018, the application was approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The equity transitional rule allows for applying a

<<<

 lower equity charge for equities bought before the introduction of Solvency II on 1 January 2016.

All operating insurance companies within the If Group met the regulatory solvency capital requirements under Solvency II as of 1 January 201

<<<

6, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017. The solvency position is reported quarterly to the supervisory authorities.

As a measure of capital adequacy, the table below shows the standard formula based solvency capital requirement for the If

<<<

 Group, corresponding to what would be the regulatory requirement if Solvency II group rules were enforced at the If Group level. Until September 2016, Topdanmark's solo own funds and solvency capital requirement were included in the overall

<<<

 If Group solvency calculation using the deduction and aggregation method.

Risk and capital modelling and Internal

<<<

 capital measures

In order to assess the overall risk profile, it is necessary to consider the interrelationships between the various types of risk the If Group faces, as some of the risks may develop in opposite directions creating natural

<<<

 hedges. For this purpose, the If Group has used an internal model for several years. The internal model is used for internal risk management only, and covers both the If Group and all material subsidiaries. The internal model covers the risks

<<<

 related to the insurance and investment operations of the If Group.

Through simulations of both investment and insurance operations, the effect of, for example, Reinsurance structure and investment allocations can be analysed simultaneously

<<<

.

In addition to the calculation of the overall capital need, the internal model is also used as a basis for decisions regarding:

·

allocation of capital to the various business areas in order to achieve consistent profit targets

throughout

<<<

 the If Group;

·

minimum and maximum weightings for each investment class, to be used as reference in the

investment policy; and

·

the retention level which affects purchase of the If Group's Reinsurance.

As described under the section

<<<

 entitled Regulatory measures above, the internal model is approved for the regulatory solvency requirements for Underwriting risks in If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ).

Rating agency measures

The rating agencies have their own models which are

<<<

 used to assess the capital position of the If Group. Due to the If Group's rating objective (to maintain an "A" insurance financial strength rating at its main operating company), meeting the capital standards set by the rating agencies is

<<<

 also a key capital requirement.

The If Group's main operating company, If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ), have financial strength ratings from S&P and Moody's, with a rating of "A+ (stable outlook)" since 2016 from S&P and "A1 (stable outlook)"

<<<

 since 2016 for Moody's. The Issuer is rated A- (stable outlook) since 2016 from S&P. Moody's is established in the EEA and registered under the CRA Regulation and appears on the latest update of the list of registered credit rating agencies

<<<

 (as of 13 November 2017) on the ESMA website (http://www.esma.europa.eu).

- 75 -

As of 31 December 2017, S&P's insurance capital model showed a diversified target capital of SEK 30,501 million (based on an "A" rating) and total adjusted

<<<

 capital of SEK 33,544 million for the If Group. If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) is regarded as a core subsidiary of Sampo Group.

Personnel

The average number of employees of the If Group in 2017 was 6,366. As at 31 December 2017 the number of

<<<

 employees of the Issuer was 1.

Applied accounting principles

Financial statements presented for the Issuer are prepared in accordance with Swedish laws and regulations. The If Group has prepared its consolidated accounts in accordance with

<<<

 international accounting standards (IFRS including the International Accounting Standards, Standard Interpretations Committee and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee), as adopted by the European Union. In addition, the

<<<

 If Group applies the supplementary provisions ensuing from legislation, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and general recommendations as well as appropriate parts of recommendations issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting

<<<

 Board. For the fiscal year 2017, the Issuer's and the If Group's accounting presentation was not subject to any significant amendments or new regulations as compared with the fiscal year 2016.

Management

In accordance with the Issuer's Articles

<<<

 of Association, the Board of Directors consists of at least three and not more than five members elected by the general meeting of shareholders for the period until the end of the annual general meeting taking place in the second financial

REGULATION
If Group
Set forth below is a summary of certain material information concerning the regulatory and supervisory environment of the insurance business conducted by the If Group. This description is a

<<<

 summary of certain legal issues and does not purport to be complete.
Supervision
The insurance companies within the If Group are subject to regulation in all countries in which they operate. The Swedish insurance companies are licensed and

<<<

 supervised by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw. Finansinspektionen) ("SFSA") and the Financial Supervision Authority in Estonia (Es. Finantsinspektsioon) is responsible for the supervision of If P&C Insurance AS, its branches

<<<

 in Latvia and Lithuania and its subsidiaries. The If Group operates its cross-border activities through branches of If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Norway, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom

<<<

. Accordingly, the SFSA is responsible for the financial supervision of such branch activities. The operations must, however, still be in compliance with the laws of the countries where the branches operate in respect of activities such as marketing

<<<

, consumer protection, insurance contract requirements and data protection.
The Issuer is a Swedish insurance holding company and is as such not a licensed company. There are however certain rules of the Swedish Insurance Business Act (Sw. forsakringsrorelselag

<<<

 (2010:2043)) and the Solvency II regulation directly applicable to the Issuer's business.
European Union regulatoryframework
The European Union ("EU") has adopted legislation with a view to harmonising the member states' regulation of the insurance

<<<

 industry, thus creating a single European market in this respect. This was to a large extent achieved through the adoption of the third generation of insurance directives in 1992. These EU directives have been implemented in the countries where

<<<

 the insurance companies within the If Group are licensed. Through the adoption of the 1992 EU directives, the single passport principle was established in the insurance business. Accordingly, a licence from a competent authority in a member

<<<

 state (the "home supervisory authority") is valid throughout the European Economic Area ("EEA"). A licensed company may carry out its business within the EEA directly or through branches, without any further requirements for authorisations

<<<

 in the countries concerned.
Furthermore, these directives also provided for minimum requirements for life and non-life insurance companies, especially in relation to capitalisation levels (today often referred to as the Solvency I regime).

<<<

 Insurance companies had to ensure that they were able to meet the obligations under their insurance contracts at any given time. They were also required to maintain a level of their own funds equal to or in excess of the solvency margin, which

<<<

 was based on the particular insurance company's business volume.
Solvency II Directive
As of 1 January 2016, the EU has adopted a full-scale revision of the solvency framework and prudential regime applicable to insurance, Reinsurance companies

<<<

 and insurance groups known as "Solvency II". The Solvency II framework replaces previous life, non-life, Reinsurance and insurance groups directives. The regime became binding on insurers and reinsurers within each Member State from 1 January

<<<

 2016.
The main aim of the Solvency II framework is to ensure the financial stability of the insurance industry across the EU and protect policyholders through establishing solvency requirements better matched to the true risks of the business

<<<

. Solvency II adopts a three-pillar approach as adopted in the banking sector in Europe. These pillars are quantitative requirements (Pillar 1); qualitative requirements (Pillar 2); and supervisory reporting and public disclosure requirements

<<<

 (Pillar 3).
With Solvency II, economic risk-based solvency requirements across all Member States of the EU has been introduced for the first time. While Solvency I included a relatively simple solvency formula based on Technical Provisions

<<<

 and insurance premiums, Solvency II introduced a new 'total balance sheet' type and risk-based regime where insurers' material risks and their interactions are considered.
- 78 -

Under Pillar 1 of Solvency II, insurers are required to hold

<<<

 own funds equal to or in excess of a solvency capital requirement ("SCR"). Solvency II rules categorise own funds into three tiers with differing qualifications as eligible available regulatory capital. Under Solvency II, basic own funds are

<<<

 derived from the solvency balance sheet in which the undertaking's assets and liabilities are valued in accordance with the Solvency II regulations. The basic own funds consist of the positive difference between assets and liabilities (including

<<<

 Technical Provisions), which are reduced by the amount of own shares held. In addition, qualifying subordinated liabilities are also included in basic own funds. A basic principle of Solvency II is that assets and liabilities are valued on

<<<

 the basis of their economic value. This is the price which an independent party would pay or receive for acquiring the assets or liabilities. The SCR is a risk based capital requirement which will be determined using either the standard formula

<<<

 (set out in level 2 implementing measures), or, where approved by the relevant supervisory authority, an internal model, or a mixture of both methods (partial internal model). A breach in SCR triggers first level intervention in the supervision

<<<

 of the entity's solvency. In addition to the SCR requirement, there is also the minimum capital requirement which intends to reflect a level of own funds that, where breached, triggers ultimate supervisory action, which may involve a transfer

<<<

 of the entity's liabilities to another issuer, withdrawal of its license or liquidation of its in-force business.

Under Pillar 2 of Solvency II, requirements for insurance companies include requirements to:

·

have effective governance systems

<<<

 in place, proportionate to their business;

·

meet specific requirements regarding risk management functions, internal controls, data quality

controls, internal audit functions, actuarial functions, compliance functions and control over


<<<


outsourcing arrangements;

·

ensure that the directors and officers of insurance companies have the required professional

qualifications and expertise;

·

integrate effective risk management systems, including strategies, processes and reporting

<<<



procedures, in order to monitor, manage and report risk exposures;

·

conduct an own risk and solvency assessment ("ORSA") on a regular basis; and

·

be effectively supervised by the National Competent Authorities.

Under Pillar 3 of Solvency

<<<

 II, extensive and frequent reporting to supervisory authorities, and additional external reporting, is required.

As of 1 January 2016, each individual insurance company within the If Group is subject to the Solvency II requirements.

Insurance

<<<

 Distribution Directive

On 23 February 2016, a new directive on insurance distribution ("IDD") entered into force in the EU. Member States have 24 months to transpose its provisions into national law. According to a recent proposal from the

<<<

 European Commission, the rules will, however, not become binding until 1 October 2018. While preparatory work is on-going with a view to implement IDD in Sweden before the 1 October 2018 deadline, IDD has not yet been implemented in Sweden

<<<

. The IDD will extend the scope of the current Insurance Mediation Directive to cover direct sales by insurance and Reinsurance companies without the use of an intermediary. Key features are, among others, mandatory disclosure requirements regarding

<<<

 remuneration, obliging insurers to disclose to their customers the nature of remuneration they receive. Further, insurers will be required to comply with information and disclosure requirements and certain conduct of business rules including

<<<

 a general obligation to act honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with customers' best interests. In the case of the sale of bundled products, for instance, the insurance company will have to inform customers about the possibility

<<<

 to purchase the components of the package separately and about the costs of each component when purchased separately. In addition, IDD sets out stricter requirements on remuneration of sales staff and introduces a mandatory product oversight

<<<

 and governance process for assessing the suitability of insurance products for customers.

- 79 -

General Data Protection Regulation
On 25 May 2018, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on

<<<

 the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) ("GDPR"), will enter into force. The GDPR contains

<<<

 a number of obligations for data controllers in their processing of personal data, and include features such as expanded territorial reach, the obligation to have a designated data protection officer, content to be included in data processing

<<<

 agreements and data breach notifications. The GDPR also sets out direct obligations for the data processors. In addition, the GDPR include a number of rights for the data subjects, such as a right to require information about data being processed

<<<

, access to data in certain circumstances, correction of incorrect data and data portability. The GDPR further establish a penalty scheme for breaches enabling data processing authorities to impose administrative fines for infringements.
Sampo

<<<

 Group
Insurance groups and financial conglomerates
In October 1998, the EU adopted a directive (98/78/EC) on the supplementary supervision of insurance undertakings within insurance groups otherwise known as the Solvency I Directive. These

<<<

 rules have been further amended and succeeded by Solvency II. The rules impose among other things, group reporting including reporting of group solvency, supervision of intra-group transactions, risk concentrations and governance on a group

<<<

 level. Furthermore, own funds and SCR are calculated on a group level. The Solvency II group definition includes an insurance company, its subsidiaries and associated insurance companies in which the group owns at least 20 per cent. of the

<<<

 share capital or the votes as well as its ultimate parent undertaking, which is an insurance holding undertaking, mixed activity insurance holding company, a mixed financial holding company or a foreign insurer established outside the EEA.

<<<

 The consolidated group will also include any subsidiaries and associated companies of the ultimate parent undertaking. In addition to the reports that each insurance company needs to submit, several of the Pillar 3 reporting requirements also

<<<

 apply to the level of the group (including the ORSA report and the annual narrative reports such as the Solvency and Financial Condition Report) and these need to be submitted to the group supervisor. In the event that a group operates in several

<<<

 Member States, a group supervisor shall be appointed among the relevant financial supervisory authorities to be responsible for the coordination and exercise of the supplementary supervision. Representatives of the relevant financial supervisory

<<<

 authorities will participate in a college of supervisors to supervise the group. The ultimate parent of the Issuer is Sampo plc. In line with this, group rules in Solvency II are applicable at the Sampo Group level. This includes group supervision

<<<

 and group solvency assessment including the calculation of group SCR, minimum consolidated group SCR, and group own funds. Furthermore, the SFSA has not made an application to apply any of the group provisions at Swedish sub-group level. As

<<<

 of the date of this Prospectus, from a regulatory point of view, the effect of this is that the If Group is not required to calculate group own funds and SCR at a sub-group level. As of 1 July 2015, the Financial Supervisory Authority in Finland

<<<

 (Fi. Finanssivalvonta) has the responsibility as group supervisor of the Sampo Group under Solvency II.
In 2002 the EU adopted Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision

<<<

 of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate (the "Conglomerate Directive"). The Conglomerate Directive introduced specific legislation for the supplementary supervision of financial groups

<<<

 that provide cross-sectoral services, typically banking and insurance services. A supervisory authority shall be the coordinator in respect of each conglomerate and shall be responsible for the supplementary supervision of the conglomerate

<<<

. In case there are several competent supervisory authorities, one of the home supervisory authorities shall act as coordinator of the conglomerate. The supervision would include regular meetings with the representatives of conglomerates, receipt

<<<

 of solvency reports, risk concentrations and internal transactions and other requested reports regarding the conglomerate, which would include an assessment as to whether the capital of the conglomerate is adequate having regard to risk concentrations

<<<

 and internal transactions etc. The assessment would also include the structure of the conglomerate, its organisation and internal control systems. With Nordea Bank AB as its associated company, the Sampo Group has, since 31 December 2009 been

<<<

 classified as a financial conglomerate under the Finnish Act on the Supervision of Financial and Insurance Conglomerates (2004/699).
As of 1 January 2016, the Sampo Group is hence subject to regulatory group capital requirements as stipulated

<<<

 by the Solvency II Directive as well as by the Conglomerate Directive.

TAXATION Swedish Taxation The following summary outlines certain Swedish tax consequences relating to Noteholders. The summary is based on the laws of Sweden as

<<<

 currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only. The summary does not address, inter alia, situations where the Notes are held in an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto), the tax consequences following

<<<

 variation or substitution (instead of redemption) of the Notes or the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers of interest. Further, the summary does not address credit of foreign taxes. Investors should consult their

<<<

 professional tax advisers regarding the Swedish tax and other tax consequences (including the applicability and effect of tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation) of acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes in their particular

<<<

 circumstances. Holders not tax resident in Sweden Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to the holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax, provided that

<<<

 such a holder (i) is not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and (ii) does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are effectively connected. Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed

<<<

 on payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes, except for certain payments of interest (and other return on Notes) to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual

<<<

) who is resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes (see "Holders tax resident in Sweden"below). Holders tax resident in Sweden In general, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) with residence

<<<

 in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, all capital income (for example, income that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on Notes) will be taxable. Specific tax consequences may be applicable to certain categories

<<<

 of corporations, for example, life insurance companies. Moreover, specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder of Notes realises a capital loss on the Notes and to any currency exchange gains or losses. If

<<<

 amounts that are deemed as interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in Sweden, including a Swedish branch or a clearing institution within the EEA, to a private individual (or the estate of a deceased individual

<<<

) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld by the legal entity on such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes should normally also be withheld on other returns on Notes (but not capital

<<<

 gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to above.
