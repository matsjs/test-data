14 September 2009

To the Bondholders in ISlN NO 001 036763.4 - 11.625 per cent SeaMetric International AS Senior Secured

<<<

 Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012

Background information to the Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
As informed previously, SeaMetric is facing major challenges with the progress and the shipyard's performance in relation to the two heavy transport

<<<

 vessels / Twin Marine Lifters ("HTVs") under construction in Panjin, China. The progress of the construction has been very slow, and the delivery dates are: uncertain. The Builder has failed to manage and perform the project in an acceptable

<<<

 way,
Despite continuous discussions during 2008 with ESSCA and. during 2009 directly with ESSCA's subcontractor CPLEC shipyard (and its parent company), no solution has been reached for bringing the project back on track and securing a reliable

<<<

 and firm delivery date.
As no solution has been found despite the efforts made by SeaMetric, it will be necessary for SeaMetric to Implement immediate steps in order to take control over the situation.
For the sake of good order, we will recapitulate

<<<

 the contract structure for the HTVs:
SeaMetric has entered into two separate (but identical) construction contracts (the "Contracts") With ESSCA (Hohg Kong) Ltd ("ESSCA") dated 31 May 2007 for the construction and delivery of the HTVs, ESSCA

<<<

 has again (as ESSCA is not a yard) entered into two back to back shipbuilding subcontracts (the "Subcontracts") with CPLEC shipyard regarding the delivery of HTVs.
SeaMetric would like to pursue various alternative solutions in the forthcoming

<<<

 discussions with ESSCA and CPLEC shipyard:
One likely alternative is that the Contracts and Subcontracts are cancelled, and that SeaMetric negotiates a new direct shipbuilding agreement with CPLEC shipyard for the completion of the two vessels

<<<

 in accordance with a revised specification for two barges (or similar simplified construction compared to the HTVs) to be delivered to SeaMetric. This alternative will involve negotiations of new shipbuilding contracts and the commercial terms

<<<

 involved for the delivery of such barges.
Another alternative is a "soft" termination involving the agreement of all parties whereby CPLEC shipyard and/or its parent company takes over and purchases the HTVs presently under construction and

<<<

 the Contracts, Subcontracts and the Refund Guarantees executed under the Contracts and Subcontracts respectively are terminated in agreement between the parties. The purchase price (whatever this will be), and any other payment received by

<<<

 SeaMetric as part of the terms of the termination, will be for the benefit of the Bondholders, with the limitations suggested in the Proposal.
The above are some of the alternatives to be discussed, but the flexibility of SeaMetric during the

<<<

 discussions with ESSCA and CPLEC shipyard should not be limited to the alternatives included herein. SeaMetric will however always provide for the interests of the Bondholders, and aim for the best possible outcome of the negotiations.
If any

<<<

 other alternative should fail, SeaMetric would like to have the option of terminating the Contracts, the Subcontracts (under the assumption that SeaMetric will be entitled to step into the

SeaMetric

Page 2

rights of ESSCA under the Subcontracts

<<<

) and make claims under the Refund Guarantees executed under the Contracts and the Subcontracts respectively. Most likely SeaMetric would have to initiate arbitration in London in order to receive payments under any of the Contracts or the Refund

<<<

 Guarantees. The outcome of an arbitration process will be uncertain, but any payments received will be for the benefit of the Bondholders, with the limitations suggested in the Proposal.
Either way, the actions described above will require

<<<

 the consent of the Bondholders. The Loan Agreement Clause 13.2 (f) provides that SeaMetric shall not make any material changes to the Contract and Clause 15.1 (g) provides that it will constitute an Event of Default if any of the Contracts

<<<

 are terminated or cease to be effective. The provision regarding "Mandatory Redemption" in Clause 10.3 (b) provides that the Loan shall be prepaid at 105% of par if the Contracts are cancelled.
Subject to the Bondholders' consent to the above

<<<

, SeaMetric is prepared to make an extraordinary prepayment of the Loan of USD 3 million, to be applied as set out in the Proposal.
Provided the Bondholders have consented to a potential termination in advance, SeaMetric will be in a much better

<<<

 and more flexible bargaining position than if SeaMetric has to make any outcome of the discussions in China subject to a retrospective consent from the Bondholders.
Please also be informed that SeaMetric has discussed the strategy referred

<<<

 above with major Bondholders. The waiver request has already been approved by Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Outstanding Loan.
