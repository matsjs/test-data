Summons to Bondholders' Meetings
1. INTRODUCTION

<<<


Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Existing Bondholders") of USD 88,000,000 15 per cent Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2011/2014 (the "Existing Bonds" or the "Existing Loan") and for the holders

<<<

 (the "New Bondholders") of USD 20,000,000 20 per cent Super Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2012/2013 (the "New Bonds" (and together with the Existing Bonds, the "Bonds") or the "New Loan"), in each case where EOAL Cyprus Holdings Limited

<<<

 (the "Company") is the issuer and borrower. In this Summons, the Existing Bondholders and the New Bondholders are referred to as the "Bondholders".
All capitalised terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in

<<<

 the loan agreement for the Existing Loan (the "Existing Loan Agreement") between the Company and the Loan Trustee dated 15 July 2011 (as amended and restated on 31 January 2012 and further amended and restated on 20 June 2012) or, as applicable

<<<

, the loan agreement for the New Loan (the "New Loan Agreement") between the Company and the Loan Trustee dated 20 June 2012.
The information in this Summons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status o f the Company is provided by

<<<

 the Company, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its entirety.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1 ARV1
EOAL Cyprus ARV1 Limited, a wholly-owned

<<<

 subsidiary of the Company, owns the converted passenger/Ro-Ro vessel known as "ARV1" and registered in the Madeira Ship Registry with call sign CQMX ("ARV1"). ARV1 is currently located in Angolan waters whilst ongoing efforts are made to relocate

<<<

 the vessel. New insurance coverage in respect of ARV1 is required from 1 August 2012 and as a result of ARVl's current location and situation, it is proposed that the hull and machinery insurance ("H&M Insurance") and protection and indemnity

<<<

 insurance in relation to ARV1 are reduced. It is proposed that H&M Insurance be reduced from its current level of USD 114,000,000 to provide coverage of USD 50,000,000, and insurance in respect of war risks will also be reduced to USD 50,0

<<<

00,000. The premium payable in respect of H&M Insurance will be USD 291,000.
The Company now seeks Bondholder consent to approve the reduction of H&M Insurance cover for ARV1. The Company believes that the reduction of premium payments in relation

<<<

 to insurance of ARV1 is of benefit to the Bondholders as it will allow the Company to preserve liquidity.
2.2 ARV2
EOAL Cyprus ARV2 Limited ("Cyprus ARV2"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company owns the passenger/Ro-Ro vessel known as 

<<<

"Normandy" and registered in the Cyprus Ship Registry with call sign 5BDU2 ("ARV2"). ARV2 is currently located at the Sembawang shipyard in Singapore. An insurance survey of ARV2 (the "Survey") was carried out on 3 July 2012 at the request of

<<<

 the current insurer of ARV2 (the "Insurer"). It was noted in the Survey that ARV2 has been stationed at the Sembawang shipyard since 2008 during which time no maintenance has been carried out on the vessel. Additionally, preventive care procedures

<<<

 have not been implemented since ARV2 arrived in Sembawang shipyard. As a result, it is likely that all electronic equipment and switchboards are nonoperational and the vessel remains in an advanced state of disrepair. It is expected that ARV

<<<

2's condition will continue to deteriorate as the Company lacks funds to support basic care and maintenance procedures.
As a result of the Survey, the Company has been informed that the Insurer wishes to cancel the protection and indemnity insurance

<<<

 that it currently provides in respect of ARV2. Replacement insurance will be difficult to obtain and will be costly. In addition, ARV2 continues to accrue port and mooring fees whilst it remains at the Sembawang shipyard.
The Company now seeks

<<<

 Bondholder consent to approve the sale of ARV2 for scrap. The Company believes that the elimination of ongoing insurance and mooring costs in relation to ARV2 is of benefit to the Bondholders.
The security for the Bonds which relates to the

<<<

 ARV2 is the following:
· a mortgage granted by Cyprus ARV2 over ARV2 dated 17 August 2011 (the "Mortgage");
· a deed of assignment of earnings and insurances granted by Cyprus ARV2 dated 17 August (the "Assignment");
· an earnings account pledge

<<<

 agreement in relation to the [ARV2] Earnings Account (together with the Mortgage and the Assignment, the "Existing Bond Security") ; and

3/7
· a mortgage granted by Cyprus ARV2 over ARV2 dated 20 June 2012 (the "New Bond Security"),
(the

<<<

 Existing Bond Security and the New Bond Security, together, the "ARV2 Security"). The Company also seeks Bondholder approval to release the ARV2 Security in connection with the disposal of ARV2.
2.3 Amendments
If the level of cover under the

<<<

 H&M Insurance in respect of ARV1 is reduced then the Company will not be able to comply with all the provisions in the Existing Loan Agreement in relation to maintaining H&M Insurance at the same or greater value than 120% of the aggregate

<<<

 outstanding amounts under the Finance Documents. The Company will also not be able to comply with all the provisions in the Existing Loan Agreement or the New Loan Agreement in relation to a scrapping of ARV2.
Given the above background, the

<<<

 Company is seeking approval to amend the terms of the Existing Loan Agreement and the New Loan Agreement and, to this end, has been in discussions with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "Committee") and certain other Bondholders

<<<

 which together hold in excess of 66 %% of the principal amount of both the outstanding Existing Bonds and the New Bonds (the "Majority Holders").
In general terms, the Company seeks to amend the terms of the Existing Loan Agreement such that

<<<

 a requirement to maintain H&M Insurance at the same or greater value than 120% of the aggregate outstanding amounts under the Finance Documents is replaced with a requirement to maintain H&M Eisurance with a value of at least USD 50,000,00

<<<

0. The Company also seeks to amend the terms of the Existing Loan Agreement and the New Loan Agreement to provide that the disposal of ARV2 shall not trigger a Mandatory Prepayment Event under the Existing Loan Agreement which would otherwise

<<<

 require the Company to redeem 100% of the Outstanding Bonds at a price equal to 108% of par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount) or a Mandatory Prepayment Event under the New Loan Agreement which would otherwise require the

<<<

 Company to redeem all remaining New Bonds (together with accrued interest on the redeemed amount) and also pay a Sale Fee and Repayment Premium to the New Bondholders.
Any proceeds that remain after the disposal of ARV2 are therefore to be

<<<

 retained as working capital by the Company and not returned to Bondholders. It is not expected that there will be significant, if any, proceeds from the disposal of ARV2 once all port and mooring fees incurred in connection with its time at

<<<

 the Sembawang shipyard have been paid.
The Company has informed the Loan Trustee that Majority Holders have entered into voting agreements with the Company agreeing to vote their Existing Bonds and/or New Bonds in favour o f the Proposal as

<<<

 set forth in paragraph 3 {Proposal) below.
3. PROPOSAL
Based on the foregoing, the Company hereby asks the Bondholders' meetings to approve the following proposal (the "Proposal"):

3.2 Accompanying approval of payment of principal in relation to ARV1

3.3 The approval of the sale of ARV2 for

<<<

 scrap metal
In relation to a sale of ARV2 for scrap, it is proposed that the Bondholders agree to amend the Existing Loan Agreement and the New Loan Agreement to remove any references to ARV2 and any trigger of a mandatory repayment of the

<<<

 Bonds in connection with the sale of ARV2 for scrap, together with such other amendments to the Existing Loan Agreement and the New Loan Agreement as are deemed necessary or desirable by the Loan Trustee in connection with the above.
3.4 Accompanying

<<<

 release of ARV2 security

<<<

 Trustee deems appropriate.
4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
4.1 The Company's evaluation:
The Company believes that the Proposal is the best solution for all stakeholders including the Bondholders in view of the Company's current financial situation

<<<

.
4.2 Non-reliance of the Loan Trustee:
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee, the Committee or the Majority Holders. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether
