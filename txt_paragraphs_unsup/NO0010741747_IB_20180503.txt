DigiPlex
DigiPlex Rosenholm AS (the Company) Board of Directors' report
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Registration no. 994 817 477
We are pleased to present the 2017 annual financial report for the Company.
BACKGROUND
DigiPlex Rosenholm

<<<

 AS forms part of the privately-owned DigiPlex Group of Companies, which specialises in building and operating data centres in the Nordic region. Founded in 2002, the Group is one of the longest standing data centre builders and operators in

<<<

 Europe, with companies registered in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The Group provides safe, secure and future ready IT housing for our customers' mission critical systems. This is not a one-size-fits-all service but

<<<

 one that is tailored to suit each customer's individual needs.
The Company operates from a facility in Rosenholm, Oslo, Norway. The facility was fully renovated in 2010 into 1,500m2 of white space. It has a large range of clients from various

<<<

 sectors including the government, telecommunications and corporates.
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Throughout 2017 the Company has continued investing in and operating from the facility at Rosenholm in Oslo providing a secure IT Housing service for its

<<<

 clients.
GOING CONCERN
Notwithstanding that the Company's equity is in a negative position (NOK 14.0 million), the Board confirms that there are sufficient funds available to the Company from its operating revenues and its existing funding

<<<

 arrangement to operate as a going concern.
The Board have evaluated the Company's value adjusted equity. The valuation of the data centre operations was based on external advice, and the Board conclude that the market value of the Company's

<<<

 equity is positive.
The Company has loans from DigiPlex Norway AS (DNAS), in the amount of NOK 143.8 million, received as guarantor to DNAS bond loan agreement. There is a shareholder loan of NOK 105.5 million, and the agreement does not contain

<<<

 restrictive covenants. Although the loan is stated to be payable on demand, there are contractual restrictions that restrict repayment thereof.
As at the date of this report, the Board do not have any reason to believe that either the related

<<<

 party, DNAS or its shareholders do not support the going concern of the Company.
Consequently, the Board is of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the activities of the Company.

In accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act section 3-3, the Board confirms that the conditions for continued operations as a going concern are present for the Company and that the annual financial statements have been prepared

<<<

 under this presumption.
INCOME STATEMENT AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
The Directors have noted continued improvement in market conditions and have decided to expand the data centre with an additional area of approximately 700 m2. The

<<<

 Company has maintained its 2016 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) level of NOK 19 million. The operating profit for the year amounts to NOK 7.6 million (2016: NOK 8.4 million).
The Company reports revenues

<<<

 of NOK 45.8 million (2016: NOK 49.1 million). The reduction was mainly driven by a lower electricity revenue, due to power tax relief, which also led to a reduction in electricity costs. IT Housing revenues increased by 1.6% from 2016 to 2

<<<

017.
EBITDA for 2017 was in the amount of NOK 19.0 million (2016: NOK 19.5 million) which represents an EBITDA margin of 41.4% (2016: 39.8%). This is the result of strict control of operating expenses such as site operation and maintenance costs

<<<

.
Total equity as of 31 December 2017 is negative NOK 14.0 million (2016: negative NOK 13.8 million). The Company's financials are as expected. Due to the signing of several new contracts and effective cost control, the Company's outlook is

<<<

 positive.
CAPITAL AND FINANCING
Net cash inflow for the year was NOK 13.3 million (2016: outflow of NOK 0.8 million). Cash inflow from operating activities amounted to NOK 15.8 million (2016: NOK 12.9 million). Cash outflow to investing activities

<<<

 amounted to NOK 2.5 million (2016: NOK 3.7 million) and there were no cash flow related to financing activities (2016: cash outflow of NOK 10 million). A detailed cash flow statement is included in the financial statements.
The difference between

<<<

 operating results and cash flow from operating activities, mainly relates to depreciation and change in trade receivable. The Company's investments are financed primarily via its operating cash flow.
There have been no changes to the Bond issue

<<<

 made in July 2015.
The Company is making interest payments to DNAS in accordance with the loan agreement drawn up on similar terms to the Bond Agreement.
No interest is due on the shareholder loans. As noted above under the `Going Concern'

<<<

 section of the report, at balance sheet date shareholder loans of NOK 105.5 million were outstanding.
The Board is confident that with the current financial resources that are available to the Company, the business's cash flow is currently

<<<

 self-sustaining.

RISKS
The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks namely; market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk

<<<

 and liquidity risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. The Company does not use derivative

<<<

 financial instruments to hedge any risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the Company's finance department under policies approve d by the Board. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written

<<<

 policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
Market risk
The Company operates nationally and is therefore exposed

<<<

 to a limited foreign exchange risk. However, its interest rate risk arises from a long-term bond loan (see note 2). Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. The interest on the loan is adjusted

<<<

 quarterly. The Company also holds borrowings issued by the shareholder. The shareholder loan is not interest bearing.
Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis
At 31 December 2017, if the Norwegian key policy rate had been 10 basis points higher/lower

<<<

 with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been NOK 144k higher/lower, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on Bond borrowings.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents

<<<

 and deposits with banks, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience

<<<

 and other factors. Credit risk related to bank insolvency is closely monitored.
Liquidity risk
The Company's finance department monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational

<<<

 needs, while maintaining sufficient headroom at all times so that the Company does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.
The Board is not aware of any additional financial risk factors

<<<

 facing the Company other than those outlined in this report.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND WORK ENVIRONMENT
As of 31 December 2017, the Company employed 2 full time staff of which there were 1 male and 1 female. None of these employees were in a leading

<<<

 management positions. The Company gives equal opportunities to its employees regardless of gender and will continue this policy in the future. The Company aims to conduct its operations with zero injuries through effective risk management.

<<<

 The Company considers the working environment as positive and there have been no serious work incidents or accidents resulting in personal injury or damages to material

or equipment during the course of

<<<

 2017. The Company also maintains a log of sick leave days taken and the absence percentage due to sick leave for 2017 was 1.7%.
All employees are part of a pension scheme.
EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
Within our environmental impact it is energy use

<<<

 and consequently carbon emissions that determine the biggest part of our environmental agenda. The Company is committed to operating sustainably with continuous improvements in environmental performance.
The initial target for the DigiPlex

<<<

 group of entities in this area was to purchase all our electricity from certified, renewable sources. We first achieved this in July 2004. We have maintained this achievement ever since.
Our aim is to be the most environmentally friendly data

<<<

 centre provider in Europe and we have put this into action with our fiercely competitively low PUE achievements to date. We particularly welcome the opportunity to work with our customers and help them to achieve their own environmental performance

<<<

 improvement goals. With the above processes and initiative in place, the Board is very proud of the small environmental footprint that it leaves behind.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Company's policy is designed and implemented in a way

<<<

 to help tackle the challenges we face in today's society. The DigiPlex policy ensures that we responsibly and fairly recruit and manage DigiPlex employees on the basis of competence and performance regardless of age, nationality, race, gender

<<<

, religious beliefs, sexuality, physical ability or cultural background. We strive on our ability to provide our customers an unprecedented level of support and flexibility in all aspects of providing a Data Centre service and do so in a manner

<<<

 that ensures our businesses future and the prosperity of all stakeholders involved.
The Company is committed to maintaining an open working environment in which employees and contractors are able to report instances of unethical, unlawful or

<<<

 undesirable conduct without fear of intimidation or reprisal. In order to maintain a current and effective responsibility strategy we promote transparency in the actions of all stakeholders and act on all relevant concerns highlighted for attention

<<<

.
We take the responsibility of fairness and equality beyond our own walls and ensure that external parties with whom we engage in business are also focused on their responsibility to the wider community. The Company's tendering process clarifies

<<<

 whether the supplier has established its own policy and guidelines for corporate social responsibility, and whether it has been involved in incidents related to corruption, child labour or breaches of human rights or the rights of employees

<<<

 to unionise.
Information on such matters is obtained from the suppliers themselves or from other investigations. Possible conditions uncovered will be significant in qualifying the supplier for participation in the tendering process.

 and practices generally accepted in Norway.
Basisfor Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs

Independent Auditor's Report - Digiplex Rosenholm AS

Responsibilities of the Board o f Directors and the Managing Directorfor the Financial Statements
The

<<<

 Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and

<<<

 accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to

<<<

 fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements use the

<<<

 going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations.
Auditors Responsibilitiesfor the Audit o f the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the

<<<

 financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an

<<<

 audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and

<<<

 are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations

<<<

, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement

<<<

 of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting

<<<

 a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding of

<<<

 internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness

<<<

 of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence

<<<

 obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw

<<<

 attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
( 2)

pwc

Independent Auditor's Report - Digiplex Rosenholm

<<<

 AS

audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial

<<<

 statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters

<<<

, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Opinion on the Board

<<<

 o f Directors' report
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors' report concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption, and

<<<

 the proposal for the coverage of the loss is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations.
Opinion on Registration and Documentation
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and

<<<

 control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews ofHistorical Financial Information, it is our opinion that

<<<

 management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the Company's accounting information in accordance with the law and bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway

Accounting principles
The annual accounts have been prepared in compliance with the Accounting Act and Norwegian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for small enterprises

<<<

 (NGAAP).
Sales Revenues IT housing service revenues are recognised and expensed over the life time for each contract. Sales costs incurred in relation to new customers contracts are deferred and expensed over the contract. Classification and

<<<

 valuation of balance sheet items Assets intended for long-term ownership or use have been classified as fixed assets. Assets relating to the trading cycle have been classified as current assets. Receivables are classified as current assets

<<<

 if they are recoverable within one year after the transaction date. Similar criteria apply to liabilities. Current assets are valued at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value. Short term liabilities are reflected in the balance

<<<

 sheet at nominal value on the establishment date.
Tangible assets Tangible assets are reflected in the balance sheet and depreciated to residual value over the asset's expected useful life on a straight-line basis. If changes in the depreciation

<<<

 plan occur the effect is distributed over the remaining depreciation period. Direct maintenance of an asset is expensed under operating expenses as and when it is incurred. Additions or improvements are added to the asset's cost price and depreciated

<<<

 together with the asset. The split between maintenance and additions/improvements is calculated in proportion to the asset's condition at the acquisition date. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost

<<<

 or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds

<<<

 and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement for the period.
Debtors Trade debtors and other debtors are reflected in the balance sheet at nominal value less provisions for doubtful debts. Provisions for doubtful

<<<

 debts are calculated on the basis of individual assessments. In addition, for the remainder of accounts receivables outstanding balances, a general provision is carried out based on expected loss.
Foreign currencies Monetary items in foreign

<<<

 currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Tax The tax charge in the income statement includes both payable taxes for the period and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at 23% on the basis of the

<<<

 temporary differences which exist between accounting and tax values, and any carry forward losses for tax purposes at the year-end. Tax enhancing or tax reducing temporary differences, which are reversed or may be reversed in the same period

<<<

, have been eliminated. Deferred tax and tax benefits which may be shown in the balance sheet are presented on a net basis. The Company elected to capitalise the deferred tax advantage.
Cash Flow Statement The Cash Flow Statement is prepared

<<<

 using the indirect method. Cash available includes petty cash, deposits on bank accounts and other short term placements which can be transformed to cash within a short time.
