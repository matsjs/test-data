<<<

 meeting dated 16 April 2009. This document contains a proposal from Krill Seaproducts for an extension of the date of securing the remaining funding of NOK 80 million.
BACKGROUND As earlier communicated Krill Seaproducts has encountered cost

<<<

 overruns on the construction project of the harvesting and factoring vessel MS Thorshovdi. The total capital expenditure ("CAPEX") of the project has increased by NOK 285,000,000 from a total of NOK 525,000,000 to a total of NOK 810,000,00

<<<

0. Part of the CAPEX increase has already been covered by a capital injection of NOK 128,482,000 by existing shareholders, partly through a convertible loan of NOK 113,482,000 (the "Shareholder Convertible Loan") and partly through new convertible

<<<

 loan of NOK 15,000,000 (the "Liquidity Convertible Loan") on March 26th 2009. Krill Seaproducts has a signed term sheet from Innovasjon Norge as a first priority debt of NOK 100,000,000. Krill Seaproducts is also in close dialog with other

<<<

 financial institutions for NOK 80,000,000. Krill Seaproducts has over a long period of time been working with various financial institutions and banks to get in place the remaining funding of NOK 80,000,000 to secure a total financial package

<<<

 for completion of the vessel. Krill Seaproducts were expecting to get this in place last week. Tuesday 28th April we were informed by one of the potential financial institutions that we cannot expect to get a final confirmation before 2-3 weeks

<<<

. Despite a positive dialogue we are still running the potential risk of not getting the necessary financing commitment.
1

TM
The Board of Directors of Krill Seaproducts are of the opinion that Krill Seaproducts under current circumstances

<<<

 should not accumulate any further credit to yard and suppliers and in anticipation of having a total financial package in place all work related to the vessel should be stopped. Krill Seaproducts has today informed yard and suppliers about

<<<

 the request to stop. Krill Seaproducts has continuously informed the ship yard, suppliers and other relevant stakeholders about the situation and despite a difficult situation the mentioned parties have shown positive goodwill during the last

<<<

 few weeks. Krill Seaproducts will continue to pursue any alternative solution and hope to be able to present a financial solution within the next few weeks. It is Krill Seaproducts intention to complete the construction.
PROPOSAL The Borrower

<<<

 proposes the following amendments of the Loan Agreement (the "Proposal"): Extension of final maturity The maturity date for securing the remaining funding shall be extended from 30 April 2009 until 31 May 2009.
All other terms unchanged
