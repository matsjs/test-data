RISK FACTORS
The following are certain risk factors o f the offering o f the Capital Securities o f which

<<<

 prospective investors should be aware. Prior to making an investment decision, prospective investors should consider carefully all o f the information set out in this Prospectus, including in particular the riskfactors detailed below. This

<<<

 description is not intended to be exhaustive and prospective investors should make their own independent evaluations o f all risk factors and should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus.
The terms defined

<<<

 in the Conditions shall have the same meaning where used below.
Factors that may affect the Issuer's ability tofulfil its obligations in respect o f the Capital Securities
The Issuer is a unit within the Volvo Group (the "Volvo Group" is defined

<<<

 as the Guarantor and its subsidiaries). The Issuer is acting as internal bank for the Volvo Group. The Issuer is responsible for all interest-bearing assets and liabilities as well as all foreign exchange and funding operations within the Volvo

<<<

 Group. The Issuer's operations are carried out according to centrally determined risk mandates and limits designed to minimise the credit currency, interest rate and liquidity risks to which the Volvo Group is exposed.
In conducting its operations

<<<

, The Issuer is exposed to various types o f financial risks. One o f the risks that can affect the Issuer's obligations in respect o f the Capital Securities is credit risk; a counterparty's failure to fulfil its contractual obligations under

<<<

 deposit arrangements, loan agreements and/or derivatives contracts. Other risks that can be encountered are currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. These risks should, however, be mitigated through the Guarantee (as defined in

<<<

 the Conditions) issued by the Guarantor in which the Guarantor undertakes to assume responsibility for the Issuer's payment obligations under the Capital Securities.
Factors that may affect the Guarantor's ability tofulfil its obligations under

<<<

 the Guarantee
A ll business operations involve risk - managed risk-taking is a condition o f maintaining a sustained favourable profitability
Risk may be due to events in the world and can affect a given industry or market. Risk can be specific

<<<

 to a single company. At the Volvo Group, work is carried out daily to identify, measure and manage risk - in some cases the Volvo Group can influence the likelihood that a risk-related event will occur. In cases in which such events are beyond

<<<

 the Volvo Group's control, the Volvo Group strives to minimise the consequences.
The risks to which the Volvo Group is exposed are classified into three main categories: External-related risks such as the cyclical nature of the commercial vehicles

<<<

 business, intense competition, changes in prices for commercial vehicles and government regulations; Financial risks such as currency fluctuations, interest level fluctuations, valuations of shares or similar instruments, credit risk and liquidity

<<<

 risk; and Operational risks such as market reception of new products, reliance on suppliers, protection and maintenance of intangible assets, complaints and legal actions by customers and other third parties and risk related to human capital

<<<

.
Short-term riskfactors
An increase in demand could potentially result in delivery disturbances due to suppliers' financial instability or shortage of resources.
Uncertainty regarding customers' access to the financing of products in emerging

<<<

 markets might have a negative impact on demand.
Volvo verifies annually, or more frequently if necessary, the goodwill value of its business areas and other intangible assets for possible impairment. The size of the surplus value differs between

<<<

 the business areas and they are, to a varying degree, sensitive to changes in the business environment. Instability in the business recovery and volatility in interest and currency rates may lead to indications of impairment.
The reported amounts

<<<

 for contingent liabilities reflect a part o f Volvo's risk exposure. Total contingent liabilities as o f 30 September 2014, amounted to SEK 16.2 billion compared to SEK 17.3 billion as o f 31
-6-

December 2013. A significant part of the contingent

<<<

 liabilities are related to credit guarantees issued as a result of sales in emerging markets, in particular sales o f construction equipment in China. The gross exposure o f SEK 16.2 billion is partly reduced by counter guarantees and collaterals

<<<

. Please refer to the Volvo Group Annual Report 2013 note 24 and pages 78 and 79 under the heading 'Litigation' for a description of the nature of contingent liabilities including information on the legal proceedings and investigations that

<<<

 the Group is currently involved in and subject to.
General risks
External-related risks
The commercial vehicles industry is cyclical
The Volvo Group's markets undergo significant changes in demand as the general economic environment fluctuates

<<<

. Investments in infrastructure, major industrial projects, mining and housing construction all impact the Volvo Group's operations as its products are central to these sectors. Adverse changes in the economic conditions for the Volvo Group

<<<

's customers may also impact existing order books through cancellations of previously placed orders. The cyclical demand for the Volvo Group's products makes the financial result of the operations dependent on the Volvo Group's ability to react

<<<

 to changes in demand, and in particular to its ability to adapt production levels and production and operating expenses.
Intense competition
Continued consolidation in the industry is expected to create fewer but stronger competitors. The Volvo

<<<

 Group's major competitors are Daimler, Iveco, MAN, Navistar, Paccar, Scania, Sinotruk, Brunswick, Caterpillar, CNH, Cummins, Deere, Hitachi, Komatsu and Terex. In recent years, new competitors have emerged in Asia, particularly in China. These

<<<

 new competitors are mainly active in their domestic markets, but are expected to increase their presence in other parts of the world.
Prices may change
The prices of commercial vehicles have, at times, changed considerably in certain markets

<<<

 over a short period. This instability is caused by several factors, such as short-term variations in demand, shortages of certain component products, uncertainty regarding underlying economic conditions, changes in import regulations, excess

<<<

 inventory and increased competition. Overcapacity within the industry can occur if there is a lack o f demand, potentially leading to increased price pressure.
Extensive government regulation
Regulations regarding exhaust emission levels, noise

<<<

, safety and levels of pollutants from production plants are extensive within the industry.
M ost of the regulatory challenges regarding products relate to reduced engine emissions. The Volvo Group is a significant player in the commercial vehicle

<<<

 industry and one of the world's largest producers o f heavy-duty diesel engines. The product development capacity within the Volvo Group is well consolidated to be able to focus resources for research and development to meet tougher emission

<<<

 regulations. Future product regulations are well known, and the product development strategy is well tuned to the introduction of new regulations.
Financial risks
In its operations, the Volvo Group is exposed to various types o f financial

<<<

 risks. Group-wide policies, which are updated and decided upon annually, form the basis of each Volvo Group company's management of these risks. The objectives of the Volvo Group's policies for management of financial risks are to optimise

<<<

 the Volvo Group's capital costs by utilising economies of scale, to minimise negative effects on income as a result o f changes in currency or interest rates, to optimise risk exposure and to clarify areas of responsibility. Monitoring processes

<<<

 and controls, which ensure that established policies are adhered to, are continuously employed. Information about key aspects of the Volvo Group's system for internal controls and risk management in conjunction with the financial reporting

<<<

 is provided in the Corporate Governance Report. M ost of the Volvo Group's financial transactions are carried out through the in-house bank of the Volvo Group: Volvo Treasury. Volvo Treasury conducts its operations within
-7-

established

<<<

 risk mandates and limits. Customer credit risks are mainly managed by the different business areas.
The nature of the various financial risks and objectives and the policies for the management of these risks are described in detail in notes

<<<

 4 and 30 in the Volvo Group Annual Report 2013 incorporated by reference in this Prospectus (see "Documents Incorporated by Reference" herein). Various aspects of financial risk are described briefly in the following paragraphs. The Volvo Group

<<<

's accounting policies for financial instruments are described in note 30 in the Volvo Group Annual Report 2013. The overall impact on a company's competitiveness is also affected, however, by how various macro-economic factors interact.
Interest

<<<

-related risk
Interest-related risk includes risks that changes in interest rates will impact the Volvo Group's income and cash flow (cash flow risks) or the fair value of financial assets and liabilities (price risks).
Currency-related risk

<<<


More than 90 per cent. of the net sales of the Volvo Group are generated in countries other than Sweden. Changes in exchange rates have a direct impact on the Volvo Group's operating income, balance sheet and cash flow, as well as an indirect

<<<

 impact on the Volvo Group's competitiveness, which over time affects the Volvo Group's earnings.
Credit-related risk
An important part of the Volvo Group's credit risk is related to how the financial assets of the Volvo Group have been placed

<<<

. The majority are placed in Swedish Government Bonds and interest bearing Bonds by Swedish real estate financing institutions.
Liquidity risk
The Volvo Group ensures its financial preparedness by always maintaining a certain portion of revenues

<<<

 in liquid assets.
Market risk from investments in shares or similar instruments
The Volvo Group is indirectly exposed to market risks from shares and other similar instruments as a result of managed capital transferred to independent pension

<<<

 plans being partly invested in instruments of these types.
Operational risks
Profitability depends on successful new products
The Volvo Group's long-term profitability depends on its ability to successfully launch and market its new products

<<<

. Product life cycles continue to shorten, putting increased focus on the success of the Volvo Group's product development.
Reliance on suppliers
The Volvo Group purchases raw materials, parts and components from numerous external suppliers

<<<

. A significant part of the Volvo Group's requirements for raw materials and supplies is filled by single source suppliers. The effects of delivery interruptions vary depending on the item or component. Certain items and components are standard

<<<

 throughout the industry, whereas others are internally developed and require unique tools that are time-consuming to replace.
The Volvo Group's costs for raw materials and components can vary significantly over a business cycle. Cost variations

<<<

 may be caused by changes in world market prices for raw materials or by an inability of the Volvo Group's suppliers to deliver.
-8-

Intangible assets

The Guarantor owns or otherwise has rights to patents and brands that refer to the products

<<<

 the Volvo Group manufactures and markets. These have been acquired over a number of years and are valuable to the operations o f the Volvo Group. The Guarantor does not consider that any o f the Volvo Group's operations are heavily dependent

<<<

 on any single patent or group of patents.

Through Volvo Trademark Holding AB, the Guarantor and Volvo Car Corporation jointly own the brand "Volvo". The Guarantor has the exclusive right to use the "Volvo" name and trademark for its products

<<<

 and services. Similarly, Volvo Car Corporation has the exclusive right to use the "Volvo" name and trademark for its products and services.

The Volvo Group's rights to use the Renault brand are restricted to the truck operations only and are

<<<

 regulated by a license from Renault s.a.s., which owns the Renault brand. The amount paid during 2013 to Renault s.a.s. for license fees amounted to SEK 5.2 million.

The Volvo Group's rights to use the Panhard brand are regulated by a license

<<<

 from Peugeot SA. The amount paid during 2013 to Peugeot SA for license fees amounted to SEK 87,000.

Complaints and legal actions

The Volvo Group could be the target of complaints and legal actions initiated by customers, employees and other

<<<

 third parties alleging health, environmental, safety or business related issues, or failure to comply with applicable legislation and regulations. Information about legal proceedings involving entities within the Volvo Group is found in the

<<<

 "Litigation" section o f this Prospectus on pages 78 and 79. Even if such disputes were to be resolved successfully, without having adverse financial consequences, they could negatively impact the Volvo Group's reputation and take up resources

<<<

 that could be used for other purposes.

Risk related to human capital

A decisive factor for the realisation o f the Volvo Group's vision is its employees and their knowledge and competence. Future development depends on the Volvo Group's ability

<<<

 to maintain its position as an attractive employer. To this end, the Volvo Group strives for a work environment in which energy, passion and respect for the individual are guiding principles. Every year a Group-wide survey is conducted, and

<<<

 according to the survey the share o f satisfied employees has been at a high level in recent years.

Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the Capital Securities

The Capital Securities may

<<<

 not be a suitable investmentfor all investors

The Capital Securities are complex financial instruments. Each potential investor in the Capital Securities must determine the suitability o f that investment in light o f its own circumstances

<<<

. In particular, each potential investor should consider, either on its own or with the help of its financial and other professional advisers, whether it:

(i)

has sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the relevant

<<<



Capital Securities, the merits and risks of investing in the relevant Capital Securities and

the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any

applicable supplement;

(ii) has access to, and knowledge of, appropriate

<<<

 analytical tools to evaluate, in the context o f its particular financial situation, an investment in the relevant Capital Securities and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;

(iii) has sufficient financial

<<<

 resources and liquidity to bear all o f the risks o f an investment in the relevant Capital Securities, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the currency in which such investor's financial activities

<<<

 are principally denominated;

-9-

(iv) understands thoroughly the terms o f the relevant Capital Securities and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant financial markets; and

(v)

is able to evaluate possible scenarios for economic

<<<

, interest rate and other factors that

may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of

<<<

 the Capital Securities.

Risks related to the Capital Securities generally

Set out below is a brief description of certain risks relating to the Capital Securities generally:

The Conditions contain provisions which may permit their modification

<<<

 without the consent o f all investors and confer significant discretions on the Trustee which may be exercised without the consent o f the Holders and without regard to the individual interests o fparticular Holders

The Conditions contain

<<<

 provisions for calling meetings of Holders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Holders including Holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Holders

<<<

 who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.

The Conditions also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of Holders and without regard to the interests o f particular Holders agree to any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation

<<<

 of any breach or proposed breach of, any o f the Conditions or any o f the provisions o f the Trust Deed which, in the opinion of the Trustee, is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Holders. In addition, the Trustee may, without

<<<

 the consent of the Holders, agree with the Issuer and the Guarantor to the substitution in place of the Issuer as the principal debtor under the Capital Securities or in place of the Guarantor o f certain entities described in Condition 16

<<<

, subject to, inter alia, the Trustee being satisfied that the interests of the Holders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution and certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed being complied with, all as more fully described

<<<

 in Condition 16 and the Trust Deed.

Withholding under the EU Directive on the Taxation o f Savings Income

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the "Taxation of Savings Income Directive") on the taxation o f savings income, M em ber States

<<<

 are required to provide to the tax authorities o f another M ember State details o f payments o f interest (or similar income) paid or secured by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in that other Member State or to certain

<<<

 limited types of entities established in that other M ember State. However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation

<<<

 to such payments (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and territories including

<<<

 Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favour of automatic

<<<

 information exchange under the Taxation of Savings Income Directive. On 18 M arch 2014, the Luxembourg Government submitted to the Luxembourg Parliament Draft Bill N° 6668 on taxation of savings income. This Draft Bill is in line with the announcement

<<<

 o f the Luxembourg Government dated 10 April 2013.

The European Council formally adopted a Council Directive amending the Taxation of Savings Income Directive on 24 M arch 2014 (the "Amending Directive"). The Amending Directive broadens the

<<<

 scope of the requirements described above. Member States have until 1 January 2016 to adopt the national legislation necessary to comply with the Amending Directive and are required to apply the new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes

<<<

 made under the Amending Directive include extending the scope of the Taxation o f Savings Income Directive to payments made to, or collected for, certain other entities and legal arrangements. They also broaden the definition of "interest payment

If a payment were to be made or collected through a M ember State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment

<<<

, neither the Issuer, the Guarantor nor any Paying Agent (as defined in the Conditions) nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Capital Security as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax

<<<

. The Issuer is required to maintain a Paying Agent in a M ember State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the Taxation of Savings Income Directive or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform

<<<

 to such Directive.
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Withholding
In certain circumstances payments made on or with respect to the Capital Securities after 31 December 2016 may be subject to U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1471 through

<<<

 1474 o f the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (commonly referred to as "FATCA"). Generally, this withholding does not apply to payments on Capital Securities that are issued prior to the date that is six months after the date on which the final regulations

<<<

 that define "foreign passthru payments" are filed with the Federal Register unless the Capital Securities are characterised as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or are materially modified after that date.
Whilst the Capital Securities

<<<

 are in global form and held within the clearing systems, in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that FATCA will affect the amount of any payment received by the clearing systems (see "Taxation - U.S. withholding tax under

<<<

 FATCA"). However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding

<<<

. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free o f withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or

<<<

 intermediary from which it receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries

<<<

 with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA), provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or

<<<

 intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. Investors should consult their own tax adviser to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer's obligations under the Capital Securities are

<<<

 discharged once it has paid the common depositary for the clearing systems (as bearer of the Capital Securities) and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through hands of the clearing systems and

<<<

 custodians or intermediaries.
Investors who purchase Capital Securities in denominations that are not an integral multiple in excess of 100,000 may be adversely affected i f definitive Capital Securities are subsequently required to be issued

<<<


It is possible that the Capital Securities may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples in excess of the 100,000 minimum denomination. In such a case a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less

<<<

 than 100,000 in his/her account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a definitive Capital Security in respect of such holding (should definitive Capital Securities be printed) and would need to purchase a principal

<<<

 amount of Capital Securities such that its holding amounts to 100,000.
If definitive Capital Securities are issued, Holders should be aware that definitive Capital Securities which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple in excess

<<<

 of 100,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Risks related to the market generally
Set out below is a brief description of the principal market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk and legal risk:
An active secondary market

<<<

 in respect o f the Capital Securities may never be established or may be illiquid and this would adversely affect the value at which an investor could sell his Capital Securities
The Capital Securities may have no established trading market

<<<

 when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their
- 11 -

Capital Securities in the secondary market (in which case the market or trading price and

<<<

 liquidity may be adversely affected) or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market.
The value o f the Capital Securities depends on a number o f economic, financial

<<<

 and political factors
The value of the Capital Securities depends on a number of interrelated factors, including economic, financial and political events in Sweden or elsewhere, including factors affecting capital markets generally and the

<<<

 stock exchanges on which the Capital Securities are traded. The price at which a Holder will be able to sell the Capital Securities prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be substantial, from the issue price or the purchase price

<<<

 paid by such Holder.
I f an investor holds Capital Securities which are not denominated in the investor's home currency, he will be exposed to movements in exchange rates adversely affecting the value o f his/her holding. In addition, the imposition

<<<

 o f exchange controls in relation to any Capital Securities could result in an investor not receiving payments on those Capital Securities
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Capital Securities and the Guarantor will make any

<<<

 payments under the Guarantee in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than euro

<<<

. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the euro or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may

<<<

 impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the euro would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Capital Securities, (2) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value

<<<

 of the principal payable on the Capital Securities and (3) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Capital Securities.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could

<<<

 adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability o f the Issuer or the Guarantor to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or

<<<

 principal.
Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments
The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential

<<<

 investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (1 Capital Securities are legal investments for it, (2) Capital Securities can be used as collateral for various types o f borrowing and (3) other restrictions

<<<

 apply to its purchase or pledge of any Capital Securities. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Capital Securities under any applicable risk-based

<<<

 capital or similar rules.
Any decline in the credit ratings o f the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Capital Securities may affect the market value o f the Capital Securities
The Capital Securities have been assigned a rating by S&P and Moody's

<<<

. The rating granted by each of S&P and Moody's or any other rating assigned to the Capital Securities may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market and other factors that may affect the value of the Capital

<<<

 Securities. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.
In addition, each of S&P and Moody's or any other rating agency may change its methodologies

<<<

 or their application for rating securities with features similar to the Capital Securities in the future. This may include the relationship between ratings assigned to an issuer's senior securities and ratings assigned to securities with features

<<<

 similar to the Capital Securities, sometimes called "notching". If the rating agencies were to change their practices or their application for rating such securities in the future and the ratings of the Capital Securities were to be subsequently

<<<

 lowered, this may have a negative impact on the trading price of the Capital Securities.
- 12 -

CRA Regulation
In general, European regulated investors are restricted under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (as amended) (the "CRA Regulation"

<<<

) from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended subject to

<<<

 transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending). Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit ratings issued by non-EU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant

<<<

 credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn

<<<

 or suspended). The list of registered and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority ("ESMA") on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence o f the status o f the relevant

<<<

 rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication o f the updated ESM A list.
Change o f law
The Conditions are based on English

<<<

 law (and in the case of Conditions 3(a) and 4(c), Swedish law) in effect as at the date of this Prospectus. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of England and Wales or Sweden or

<<<

 administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus. Furthermore, the Issuer operates in a heavily regulated environment and has to comply with extensive regulations in Sweden and elsewhere. No assurance can be given as to the impact

<<<

 of any possible judicial decision or change to laws or administrative practices after the date of this Prospectus.
Risks related to the structure of the Capital Securities
The Capital Securities are subordinated obligations
The Capital Securities

<<<

 are direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer, ranking behind claims of unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer and creditors of the Issuer in respect of Issuer Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined in the Conditions), pari

<<<

 passu without any preference among themselves and with any present and future outstanding Parity Securities of the Issuer (as defined in the Conditions) and in priority to payments to holders of all classes of share capital of the Issuer in

<<<

 their capacity as such holders.
The Guarantee constitutes a direct, unsecured and subordinated obligation of the Guarantor, which ranks behind claims of unsubordinated creditors of the Guarantor and creditors of the Guarantor in respect of

<<<

 Guarantor Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined in the Conditions), pari passu with any Parity Obligations of the Guarantor (as defined in the Conditions) and in priority to payments to holders of all classes o f share capital of the Guarantor

<<<

 in their capacity as such holders.
Subject to applicable law, no Holder may exercise, claim or plead any right of set-off, compensation or retention in respect of any amount owed to it by the Issuer and/or the Guarantor in respect of, or arising

<<<

 under or in connection with, the Capital Securities and each Holder shall, by virtue of his/her holding, be deemed to have waived all such rights o f set-off, compensation or retention.
Consequently, if the financial condition of the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Guarantor were to deteriorate, Holders could suffer direct and materially adverse consequences, including suspension of interest payments. In the event o f the voluntary or involuntary liquidation (likvidation), bankruptcy (konkurs

<<<

) or company re construction (foretagsrekonstruktion) o f the Issuer and/or the Guarantor, Holders could lose their entire investment.
The Capital Securities are long-term securities and therefore an investment in Capital Securities constitutes

<<<

 afinancial riskfo r a long period
The 5.5 year Non-Call Capital Securities will be redeemed on 10 June 2075 and the 8.25 year Non-Call Capital Securities will be redeemed on 10 M arch 2078, unless they have been previously redeemed or repurchased

<<<

. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Capital Securities at any time before this date. The holders of the Capital Securities have no right to call for their redemption. Therefore, prospective investors should be aware that they may

<<<

 be required to bear the financial risks o f an
- 13 -

investment in the Capital Securities for a long period and may not recover their investment before the end of this period.
Deferral o f interest payments
The Issuer may, at any time and

<<<

 in its sole discretion, elect to defer payment o f all (but not some only) of the interest which would otherwise be paid on any Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Conditions), and the Issuer shall not have any obligation to make such

<<<

 payment and any failure to pay shall not constitute a default by the Issuer for any purpose.
Any interest not paid on an applicable Interest Payment Date and deferred shall constitute Deferred Interest and shall be paid in whole, but not in

<<<

 part, at any time, at the option of the Issuer or on the occurrence of a Deferred Interest Payment Event, as defined in the Conditions.
Any deferral of interest payments will be likely to have an adverse effect on the market price of the Capital

<<<

 Securities. In addition, as a result of the above provisions of the Capital Securities, the market price of the Capital Securities may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject

<<<

 to the above provisions and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition.
Early redemption risk
The Issuer will have the right to redeem the Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, on any Optional

<<<

 Redemption Date.
Such redemption will be exercised at the principal amount of the Capital Securities together with any accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the redemption date (including any accrued by unpaid Deferred Interest

<<<

).
The Issuer may also, at its option, redeem the Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, upon the occurrence of a Tax Deductibility Event, a Substantial Repurchase Event, a Rating Event or a W ithholding Tax Event, as further described

<<<

 in Condition 7.
Such redemption options will be exercised at an amount equal to (i) 101 per cent. o f the principal amount o f the Capital Securities, where such redemption occurs before the 5.5 year Non-Call Capital Securities or the 8.25

<<<

 year Non-Call First Reset Date, as the case may be, or (ii) 100 per cent. o f the principal amount o f the Capital Securities, where such redemption occurs on or after the 5.5 year Non-Call Capital Securities or the 8.25 year Non-Call First

<<<

 Reset Date, as the case may be (with the exception of redemption for a W ithholding Tax Event in which case they will be redeemed at all times at 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the Capital Securities), together, in each case, with

<<<

 any accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the redemption date (including any accrued by unpaid Deferred Interest).
The redemption at the option of the Issuer may affect the market value of the Capital Securities. During any period

<<<

 when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Capital Securities, the market value of the Capital Securities generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed.
The Issuer might redeem the Capital Securities when

<<<

 its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Capital Securities. There can be no assurance that, at the relevant time, Holders will be able to reinvest the amounts received upon redemption at a rate that will provide the same

<<<

 return as their investment in the Capital Securities. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
Substitution or variation o f the Capital Securities
There is a risk that, after

<<<

 the issue of the Capital Securities, a Tax Deductibility Event, a Rating Event or a Withholding Tax Event, may occur which would entitle the Issuer, without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Holders, to substitute or vary the

<<<

 Capital Securities, subject to not being prejudicial to the interest o f the Holders, so that after such substitution or variation the Capital Securities remain or become, as the case may be, Qualifying Capital Securities (as defined in the

<<<

 Conditions).
Any such substitution or variation may have a significant adverse impact on the price of, and/or the market for, the Capital Securities.

Interest rate risk Interest on the Capital Securities before the 5.5 year Non-Call

<<<

 First Reset Date or the 8.25 year Non-Call First Reset Date, as the case may be, which is calculated at a fixed rate, involves the risk that changes in market interest rates during such period may adversely affect the value of the Capital Securities

<<<

. Following the 5.5 year Non-Call First Reset Date or the 8.25 year Non-Call First Reset Date, as the case may be, the interest rates o f the Capital Securities will be reset as from the 5.5 year Non-Call First Reset Date or the 8.25 year Non

<<<

-Call First Reset Date and then every five year period and shall be calculated on the basis of the 5 Year Euro Mid-Swap Rate (as defined in the Conditions) plus the relevant margin. The 5 Year Euro Mid-Swap Rates are not pre-defined for the

<<<

 lifespan of the Capital Securities. Higher 5 Year Euro Mid-Swap Rates mean a higher interest and lower 5 Year Euro Mid-Swap Rates mean a lower interest. Each reset interest rate may be different from the initial interest rate of the relevant

<<<

 Capital Securities and may adversely affect the yield of such Capital Securities. Limited Remedies Only if default is made by the Issuer or the Guarantor for a period of 30 days or more in relation to the payment of any interest in respect

 of the relevant Capital Securities which is due and payable, will it be possible under the Conditions for the Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Holders, to institute proceedings for the voluntary or involuntary liquidation (likvidation), bankruptcy

 give notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor that the relevant Capital Securities are, and shall immediately thereby become, due and repayable at their principal amount together with any accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) such

<<<

 date (including any accrued but unpaid Deferred Interest). The deferral of an interest payment made in accordance with the Conditions shall not constitute a default by the Issuer or the Guarantor under the relevant Capital Securities or Guarantee

<<<

. No limitation on issuing or guaranteeing debt ranking senior or pari passu with the Capital Securities There is no restriction in the Conditions on the amount of debt which the Issuer or the Guarantor may issue or guarantee. The Issuer, the

 Guarantor and their subsidiaries and affiliates may incur additional indebtedness or grant guarantees in respect of indebtedness of third parties, including indebtedness or guarantees that rank pari passu or senior to the Capital Securities

DESCRIPTION OF THE GUARANTOR

General

AB Volvo (publ) (the "Guarantor" or "AB Volvo") is the parent company o f the Volvo Group and was incorporated on 5th May, 1915 under

<<<

 the laws of Sweden. The Guarantor is registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office under No. 556012-5790 as a public company with limited liability and has its registered office at SE-405 08 Goteborg, Sweden. The telephone number

<<<

 o f the office is +46 31 66 00 00.

The objects of the Guarantor's operations are set out in paragraph 2 of its Articles of Association. They include (directly or through subsidiaries) carrying on business within the areas of transport, foodstuffs

<<<

, energy and finance (with the exception, however, of activities provided for the Swedish Banking Business Act and the Swedish Credit Market Companies Act), managing real estate and moveable property and carrying on other activities compatible

<<<

 therewith.

The Guarantor is the holding company o f all the companies in the Volvo Group, directly or indirectly, and the assets of the Guarantor are substantially comprised of shares in Volvo Group companies. The Guarantor does not conduct

<<<

 any business itself and is therefore dependent on the Volvo Group companies and the revenues received by them.

The Volvo Group is an international transport equipment group with a worldwide marketing organisation and production. The Guarantor

<<<

 started production o f cars in 1927 and o f trucks in 1928. Historically, the Volvo Group has operated in two main areas: cars and vehicles for commercial use. The latter includes trucks, buses, construction equipment and marine and industrial

<<<

 engines. Operations has also included production o f aircraft engine components (and related services) and financial services. In M arch 1999, the Volvo Group sold Volvo Cars to Ford M otor Company. Through the acquisition of M ack Trucks Inc

<<<

. and Renault V.I. in 2001, the Volvo Group strengthened its position as a producer o f heavy trucks. Through the acquisitions of Japanese truck manufacturer Nissan Diesel (name changed to UD Trucks in 2009), Chinese wheel-loader manufacturer

<<<

 Lingong and Ingersoll Rand's division for road construction equipment in 2007, and the formation of a joint-venture for the production of trucks and buses with Indiabased Eicher Motors in 2008, the Volvo Group has considerably strengthened

<<<

 its position in Asia. On 1 October 2012, the Volvo Group completed the divestment o f Volvo Aero to GKN. The Volvo Group is today focused entirely on the commercial transport products segment.

Headquartered in Goteborg, Sweden the Volvo Group

<<<

 had 93,438 employees as at 30 September 2014. The Volvo Group operates in an international environment with manufacturing carried out in 18 countries and w ith sales in more than 190 countries worldwide. Its shares are traded on Nasdaq Stockholm

<<<

 Exchange, Sweden.

Principal activities

The Volvo Group has its origins in 1927. The first truck, the Series 1, was presented in January 1928. Today, the Volvo Group is one o f the world's leading suppliers o f commercial transport solutions

<<<

 providing products such as trucks, buses, construction equipment as well as drive systems for marine and industrial applications. The Volvo Group also offers its customers spare parts and aftermarket services as well as financial services.

<<<



The Volvo Group's vision is to become the world leader in sustainable transport solutions by:

·

creating value for customers in selected segments;

·

pioneering products and services for the transport and infrastructure industries;

·


<<<


driving quality, safety and environmental care; and

·

working with energy, passion and respect for the individual.

- 71 -

Principal markets Volvo Group customers are active in more than 190 countries worldwide, mainly in Europe, Asia and

<<<

 North America. Group sales of products and services are conducted through both wholly-owned and independent dealers. The global service network handles customer demand for spare parts and other services. The Volvo Group's largest geographical

<<<

 markets during the first nine months of 2014 were Europe which accounted for 37 per cent. o f net sales, N orth America 27 per cent. and Asia 19 per cent.. The Industrial Operations' net sales per segment during the first nine months of 20

<<<

14 were distributed as follows: Trucks 68 per cent., Construction Equipment 20 per cent., Buses 6 per cent., Volvo Penta 3 per cent. and Corporate Functions, Group Functions and Other Areas 3 per cent.. Organisational Structure
The Volvo Group

<<<

's business activities are organized into six business areas: Group Trucks, Construction Equipment, Buses, Volvo Penta, Governmental Sales and Volvo Financial Services. The Group Trucks operations, which account for almost two-thirds of the

<<<

 Volvo Group's total sales, are organized into five divisions. There are three sales and marketing divisions: Group Trucks Sales & Marketing Americas (with responsibility for North and South America), Group Trucks Sales & Marketing EMEA (with

<<<

 responsibility for Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and Group Trucks Sales & Marketing and JVs APAC (with responsibility for Asia and the Pacific region and for the Group's joint-venture truck companies). There is also a division with responsibility

<<<

 for product development of engines, transmissions and trucks as well as for purchasing: Group Trucks Technology ("GTT"). Finally, Group Trucks Operations ("GTO") is a division within Group Trucks with responsibility for production of trucks

<<<

 and the Volvo Group's engines and transmissions. GTO is also responsible for the Group's spare parts supply and logistics operations. As of 1 January 2015 the current three sales and market regions in Group Trucks will be merged into a single

<<<

 global sales organization, which will be organized in seven regions w ith underlying market organizations. Today's three regional sales offices will be consolidated into a single global head office for sales located in Gothenburg, Sweden. The

<<<

 new organization will generate opportunities for a more cost-effective global structure with a clearer focus on customers, brands and product offering. In conjunction with the merger of the sales organization, the existing purchasing department

<<<

 for the truck operation will be moved from GTT to GTO. There are seven Corporate Functions: Corporate Human Resources, Corporate Sustainability & Public Affairs, Corporate Communication, Corporate Finance & Control, Corporate Legal & Compliance

<<<

, Corporate Process & IT and Corporate Strategy, providing support to the CEO and the Group Executive Team with expertise in each Corporate Function area and developing standards for the entire organization through policies, directives and guidelines

<<<

 the strategicprogram 2013-2015 and changedformatfor externalfollow-up
The Volvo Group's current strategic program for the period 2013-2015 is ongoing and there is a high speed in the implementation o f the activities that have been launched

<<<

. The overall aim o f the activities is to improve the profitability of the Volvo Group. In the previously communicated profit improvement target, SEK 6.5 billion is targeted structural cost reductions. Potential to reduce structural costs further

<<<

 has been identified, among other things by creating a more efficient truck sales organization, further cost reduction activities in Volvo Construction Equipment ("Volvo CE") in order to right-size the cost structure and address product profitability

<<<

 as well as a review of what is core and non-core in the IT operations. The unaudited Interim Report for the First Three Quarters o f the Financial Year 2014, which is incorporated by reference in this Prospectus, includes further information

 on the strategic program.
Volvo CE transfers backhoe loaders and motor graders to SDLG to improveprofitability
As part o f the Volvo Group's ongoing activities to improve profitability and reduce costs, Volvo Construction Equipment will discontinue

 development and production of its current product line of Volvo-branded backhoe loaders and motor graders. In the future, these products will instead be manufactured by Volvo C E 's Chinese company SDLG.
As communicated in conjunction with

<<<

 the report on the third quarter of 2014, further cost-saving measures will be implemented in Volvo CE to adapt the cost structure and to address the profitability of certain products. A review of the operation has now been performed, resulting

<<<

 in the decision by Volvo CE to discontinue product development and production of backhoe loaders and motor graders in Europe and Americas and transfer these operations to its Chinese company SDLG. Combined with other efficiency enhancement

<<<

 measures, this will result in a workforce reduction of about 1,000 employees, of whom the majority are in Poland, the US and Brazil.
The current product lines of technologically advanced and high-spec Volvo-branded backhoe loaders and motor

<<<

 graders have addressed a relatively small premium segment of the market. SDLG-branded backhoe loaders and motor graders will better serve customer demands in the large and growing value segment of the market.
Currently, motor graders are built

<<<

 at Volvo CE's production sites in Shippensburg, US, and Pederneiras, Brazil, while backhoe loaders are manufactured in Pederneiras, Brazil, and Wroclaw, Poland. Ceasing European production o f backhoe loaders will result in the closure o f

 Volvo CE's operations in Wroclaw.
The measures within Volvo CE are a part of the series of new activities within the increased scope of Volvo Group's strategic program 2013-2015, which was published in conjunction with the report on the third

 quarter 2014. Combined, these activities are expected to reduce Volvo Group's structural costs by SEK 3.5 billion. Together w ith ongoing activities, the ambition in the strategic program is to reduce Volvo Group's structural costs by SEK

The Volvo Group receives Statement of objectionsfrom the European Commission regarding on-going antitrust investigation
The Volvo Group has on 20 November

<<<

 2014 received a Statement of objections from the European Commission, stating the Commission's preliminary view that Volvo and other companies in the truck industry may have breached EU antitrust rules. The Statement of objections does not

<<<

 prejudice the final outcome of the Commission proceedings. Volvo is now evaluating the implications of the Statement of objections.
In January 2011, the Volvo Group and a number of other companies in the truck industry became part of an investigation

<<<

 by the European Commission regarding a possible violation of EU antitrust rules. The Volvo Group is cooperating fully with the authorities and has previously announced that it is of the view that it is probable that Volvo Group's financial

<<<

 results and cash flow may be materially adversely affected as a result o f the Commission's investigation.
The Statement o f objections is a formal step in the Commission's antitrust investigations, informing the parties concerned in writing

<<<

 of the Commission's preliminary standpoint. Subsequent to the Statement of objections the parties may examine the documents in the Commission's investigation file and provide a response, before the Commission takes a decision on the matter

Provisionfor expected credit lossesfor Volvo CE in China
Volvo C E's operating income for the fourth quarter o f 2014 will be

<<<

 negatively impacted by approximately SEK 650 million from a provision for expected credit losses in China. The provision will have limited impact on the Volvo Group's cash flow and net financial debt in the fourth quarter 2014.
Following an

<<<

 extended period of declining demand, low machine utilization and lower raw materials prices, profitability for customers and dealers primarily in the Chinese mining industry has declined and their financial position has weakened. The risk for

<<<

 future credit losses has therefore increased and as a consequence Volvo CE is provisioning SEK 650 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The current provision level for expected credit losses is based on Volvo Group's prevailing best estimate

<<<

.
The Volvo Group makes provision related to EU antitrust investigation
After an evaluation of the Statement of objections, issued by the European Commission on 20 November 2014 in the on-going antitrust investigation relating to the time period

<<<

 prior to 18 January 2011, the Volvo Group has decided to make a provision o f EUR 400 M (SEK 3.7 billion). The provision will impact the operating income negatively in the fourth quarter of 2014.
As a result of an evaluation of the Statement

<<<

 of objections, the Volvo Group will make a provision of EUR 400 M (SEK 3.7 billion) in the fourth quarter o f 2014. However, the proceedings are still at an early stage and there are a number of uncertainties associated with the final outcome

<<<

 of the Commission's investigation as well as the amount of a potential fine. The Volvo Group will re-assess the size of the provision regularly following the development of the proceedings.
The provision will impact the Volvo G roup's operating

 income in the segment Trucks. The net financial debt and cash flow will not be impacted in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In January 2011, the Volvo Group and a number of other companies in the truck industry became part of an investigation by

TAXATION
The statements below in relation are general in nature and neither these statements nor any other statements in this Prospectus are to

<<<

 be regarded as advice on the tax position of any holder of Capital Securities or any person purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in Capital Securities. Prospective holders of Capital Securities and holders of Capital Securities who are

<<<

 in doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional advisers.
Swedish Taxation
The following overview outlines certain Swedish tax consequences o f the acquisition, ownership and disposal o f Capital Securities. The overview

<<<

 is based on the laws o f the Kingdom o f Sweden as currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only. The overview is not exhaustive and does thus not address all potential aspects o f Swedish taxation that may be relevantfo

<<<

 r a potential investor in the Capital Securities and is neither intended to be nor should be construed as legal or tax advice. In particular, the overview does not address situations where Capital Securities are held in an investment savings

<<<

 account (Sw. investeringssparkonto) or the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers o f interest. Specific tax consequences, which are not described below, may be applicable to certain categories o f corporations, e.g

<<<

. investment companies and life insurance companies. Investors should consult their professional tax advisers regarding the Swedish and foreign tax consequences (including the applicability and effect o f double taxation treaties) o f acquiring

<<<

, owning and disposing o f Capital Securities in their particular circumstances.
Non-resident holders o f Capital Securities
As used herein, a non-resident holder means a holder o f Capital Securities who is (a) an individual who is not a resident

<<<

 of Sweden for tax purposes and who has no connection to Sweden other than his/her investment in the Capital Securities, or (b) an entity not organised under the laws of Sweden.
Payments o f any principal amount or any amount that is considered

<<<

 to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of any Capital Securities should not be subject to Swedish income tax provided that such holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Capital Securities

-resident holders o f Capital Securities

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the laws o f 21 June 2005 as amended (the "Laws") mentioned below, there is no withholding tax on payments o f principal, premium or

<<<

 interest made to non-resident holders of Capital Securities, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect o f the Capital Securities, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the Capital Securities held

<<<

 by non-resident holders of Capital Securities.

Under the Laws implementing EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments and ratifying the treaties entered into by Luxembourg

<<<

 and certain dependent and associated territories o f EU M ember States (the "Territories"), payments o f interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to or for the immediate benefit of an individual

<<<

 beneficial owner or a residual entity, as defined by the Laws, which is a resident of, or established in, an EU M ember State (other than Luxembourg) or one o f the Territories will be subject to a withholding tax unless the relevant recipient

<<<

 has adequately instructed the relevant paying agent to provide details of the relevant payments of interest or similar income to the competent fiscal authority o f Luxembourg or, in the case of an individual beneficial owner, has provided a

<<<

 tax certificate issued by the fiscal authorities of his/her country of residence in the required format to the relevant paying agent. Responsibility for the withholding of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payments of

<<<

 interest under the Capital Securities coming within the scope of the Laws would at present be subject to withholding tax o f 35 per cent. On 18 M arch 2014, the Luxembourg Government submitted to the Luxembourg Parliament Draft Bill N° 666

<<<

8 on taxation of savings income putting an end to the current withholding tax regime as from 1 January 2015 and implementing the automatic exchange of information as from that date. This draft Bill is in line with the announcement of the Luxembourg

<<<

 government dated 10 April 2013.

(ii) Resident holders o f Capital Securities

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law o f 23 December 2005, as amended (the "Law") mentioned below, there is no withholding

<<<

 tax on payments o f principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident holders of Capital Securities, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of Capital Securities, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption

<<<

 of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payments o f interest under the Capital Securities coming within the scope o f the Law would be subject to withholding

<<<

 tax o f 10 per cent.

EU Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the "Taxation of Savings Income Directive") on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, Member States are required

<<<

 to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar income) paid or secured by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in that other Member State or to certain limited types

<<<

 o f entities established in that other M ember State. However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments

<<<

 (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have

<<<

 adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system w ith effect from 1 January 2015, in favour o f automatic information

<<<

 exchange under the Directive. On 18 March 2014, the Luxembourg Government submitted to the Luxembourg Parliament Draft Bill N° 6668

- 81 -

on taxation o f savings income. This Draft Bill is in line with the announcement o f the Luxembourg

<<<

 Government dated 10 April 2013.
The European Council formally adopted a Council Directive amending the Taxation of Savings Income Directive on 24 M arch 2014 (the "Amending Directive"). The Amending Directive broadens the scope of the requirements

<<<

 described above. Member States have until 1 January 2016 to adopt the national legislation necessary to comply with the Amending Directive and are required to apply the new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes made under the Amending

<<<

 Directive include extending the scope of the Taxation o f Savings Income Directive to payments made to, or collected for, certain other entities and legal arrangements. They also broaden the definition of "interest payment" to cover income

<<<

 that is equivalent to interest.
U.S. withholding tax under FATCA
Sections 1471 through 1474 o f the U.S. Internal Revenue Code o f 1986 ("FATCA") impose a new reporting regime and potentially a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to certain

<<<

 payments to any non-U.S. financial institution (a "foreign financial institution", or "FFI" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a "Participating FFI" by entering into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to provide

<<<

 the IRS with certain information in respect o f its account holders and investors or is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA. The Issuer (and the Guarantor, where applicable) may be classified as an FFI.
The new withholding

<<<

 regime was phased in beginning 1 July 2014 for payments from sources within the United States and will apply to "foreign passthru payments" (a term not yet defined) no earlier than 1 January 2017. This withholding would potentially apply to

<<<

 payments in respect o f (i) any Capital Securities characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterized as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or after the "grandfathering date", which is

<<<

 the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are filed with the Federal Register, or which are materially modified on or after the grandfathering date and (ii

<<<

) any Capital Securities characterised as equity or which do not have a fixed term for U.S. federal tax purposes, whenever issued. If Capital Securities are issued before the grandfathering date, and additional Capital Securities of the same

<<<

 series are issued on or after that date, the additional Capital Securities may not be treated as grandfathered, which may have negative consequences for the existing Capital Securities, including a negative impact on market price.
The United

<<<

 States and a number of other jurisdictions have entered into or are in the process of negotiating intergovernmental agreements to facilitate the implementation o f FATCA (each, an "IGA"). Pursuant to FATCA and the "Model 1" and "Model 2" IGAs

<<<

 released by the United States, an FFI in an IGA signatory country could be treated as a "Reporting FI" not subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives. Further, an FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction would not generally be

<<<

 required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) (any such withholding being "FATCA Withholding") from payments it makes. The M odel 2 IGA leaves open the possibility that a Reporting FI might in the future be required

<<<

 to withhold as a Participating FFI on foreign passthru payments. Under each Model IGA, a Reporting FI would still be required to report certain information in respect of its account holders and investors to its home government or to the IRS

<<<

. Sweden and the United States have entered into a Model 1 IGA. Under this IGA, the Issuer expects that payments on Capital Securities generally will be exempt from withholding under FATCA even if such Capital Securities are not grandfathered

<<<

.
Even if this were not the case, whilst the Capital Securities are in global form and held within the clearing systems, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Capital Securities

<<<

 by the Issuer, the Guarantor (where applicable), any paying agent and the Common Depositary, given that each of the entities in the payment chain between the Issuer or the Guarantor (where applicable) and the participants in the clearing systems

<<<

 is a major financial institution whose business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Capital Securities. The documentation expressly contemplates the

<<<

 possibility that the Capital Securities may go into definitive form and therefore that they may be taken out of the clearing systems. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. However,

<<<

 definitive Capital Securities will only be printed in remote circumstances.
- 82 -

FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and model

<<<

 IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to payments they may receive in connection

<<<

 with the Capital Securities. TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH IRS CIRCULAR 230, EACH TAXPAYER IS HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY TAX DISCUSSION HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY THE TAXPAYER FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING

<<<

 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE TAXPAYER; (B) ANY SUCH TAX DISCUSSION WAS WRITTEN TO SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) THE TAXPAYER SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED

<<<

 ON THE TAXPAYER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISER. The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT") On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for

<<<

 a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States"). The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain

<<<

 dealings in Capital Securities (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating M ember

<<<

 States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Capital Securities where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating M ember State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed

<<<

 to be, "established" in a participating M ember State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings

<<<

 is issued in a participating M ember State. A joint statement issued in May 2014 by ten o f the eleven participating Member States indicated an intention to implement the FTT progressively, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain

<<<

 derivatives, with this initial implementation occurring by 1 January 2016. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation. Additional EU Member

<<<

 States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of Capital Securities are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

 hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Capital Securities. Any such short positions could adversely
