To the bondholders in:

ISIN NO 001060119.8 11.75 per cent. Dannemora Mineral AB Callable Senior Secured Bond Issue 2011/2016

Oslo, 22 July 2013
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting regarding request for a temporary

<<<

 waiver of the Minimum Liquidity covenant in the Bond Agreement

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned issue with ISIN NO001 060119.8 (the "Bond Issue") issued by Dannemora

<<<

 Mineral AB ("Dannemora" or "Company").
Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 18 March 2011 (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this summons

<<<

 regarding the Company and market conditions is provided by the Company, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. Introduction and Background
1.1 Operational Update
The Dannemora mine

<<<

 has produced more or less the planned quantity of ore so far in 2013, albeit with a lower iron content than expected. After a relatively stable first quarter, with an average recovery of approximately 30 per cent., there was a gradual increase

<<<

 in the recovery rate in the early part of the second quarter. The return to recovery of approximately 40 per cent, in April came as a result of new analysis in respect of mineralisation. However, after the positive start of the second quarter

<<<

, the recovery suffered a sharp fall to weekly lows of 21 per cent, and 19 per cent, for two weeks in May due to the unexpected presence of waste rock in two of the mined highgrade ore bodies. The location of the pockets of waste rock meant

<<<

 that they also had to be mined in order to reach high quality ore. After the waste rock was passed, the recovery returned to around 40 percent, at the end of the month.
As previously announced, the Company has initiated an investment project

<<<

 aimed at increasing the recovery in the sorting process. The first step of the investment - to increase the recovery by 3 per cent. - was achieved during the three-week period after the installations of two new separator stages and the installation

<<<

 of an ore bin in front of a crusher for optimised crushing. The project was a success and was completed faster (week 23 instead of week 27) and at a lower cost (SEK 25 million instead of SEK 30 million) than planned. The investments, which

<<<

 also allow separation of waste materials to take place earlier in the process, have made it possible to increase

throughput at the sorting plant by over five per cent. This optimisation of magnetic separation caused a short production stoppage in early June. Following the upgrade, weekly averages have been

<<<

 39 per cent., 45 per cent., 44 per cent, and 38 per cent., and recovery is currently running in the mid-40 per cent, range.
Work aimed at achieving a further increase in the recovery continues with the planning and design of investment stage

<<<

 two.
1.2 Financial Update
The temporary decline in the recovery in May means that the Company will not achieve a positive EBITDA in the second quarter. In this situation, this does not necessitate any adjustment to the production estimate for

<<<

 the rest of the year; however, due to the sharp variations in run-of-mine (ROM) iron content and recovery, there is some uncertainty about production volumes going forward, which in turn means increased uncertainty regarding the estimated cash

<<<

 flow for the year. Therefore, over the coming weeks, the Company is likely to breach the minimum liquidity covenant in Clause 13.5(f) of the Bond Agreement (which requires that the Company maintains a minimum Liquidity (as defined in the Bond

<<<

 Agreement) of SEK 50 million at all times) (the "Minimum Liquidity Covenant"), with the first breach likely to occur in the next two weeks.
1.3 Strategic Review
In light of the Company's current publicised financial position, the Company has

<<<

 engaged Swedbank First Securities as the Company's financial adviser, Recore AS as its Chief Restructuring Officer, Roschier Advokatbyrå AB as its legal adviser and Graneli to assist with financial modelling (the "Advisers"), in each case in

<<<

 connection with the proposals set out in this summons, a potential readjustment of the legal and financial platform on which the Company operates and an analysis of the Company's cash flows over the coming months.
The Company also wishes to

<<<

 inform Bondholders that the Company's chief financial officer, Niklas Kihl, is currently working part-time; however, this is not expected to have any negative impact on the Company's ability to address adequately the matters referred to in

<<<

 this summons, given the appointment of the Advisers.
The Advisers are acting solely for the Company and no-one else in connection with the proposals set out in this summons. No due diligence investigations have yet been carried out by the Advisers

<<<

 with respect to the Company, and the Advisers expressly disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the proposals described in this summons.
1.4 The Bondholder Committee
In response to the Company's strategic review, a group

<<<

 of the largest Bondholders have formed themselves into an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "Committee") for the purpose of engaging with the Company in connection with the matters set out in this summons. The Committee have informed

<<<

 the Company that they hold approximately 71% of the principal amount outstanding of the Bonds. With

NORSK TILLITSMANN

the support of the Committee, NTM has retained Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham") as its

<<<

 legal adviser (for and on behalf of the Bondholders). NTM will also engage local counsel in the relevant jurisdictions to the extent necessary. Bondholders may contact Bingham as follows: Margaret Murray - Tel: +44 20 7661 5478 - Email: margaret

<<<

.murray@bingham.com.
The members of the Committee have signed confidentiality agreements with the Company in order that they may receive more detailed financial and operational information regarding the Company in connection with its strategic

<<<

 review. It is expected that any information received by the Committee that is price sensitive will thereafter be made available to the Bondholders generally, likely in September 2013, if not before.
1.5 Request for waiver
Dannemora hereby requests

<<<

 that the Bondholders temporarily waive the Minimum Liquidity Covenant in order that the Company does not breach the terms of the Bond Agreement (the "Waiver"). As at the date of this summons, the Company has already received legally binding

<<<
