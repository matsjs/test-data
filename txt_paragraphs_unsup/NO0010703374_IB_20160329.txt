Information to Bondholders - Correction of Payments to Bondholders
Reference is made to the summons to Bondholders' Meeting in the above mentioned Bond dated 11 March 2016 (the "Summons"). Defined terms used herein

 shall have the same meaning as given to them in the Summons. Reference is also made to the information to Bondholders regarding the Payments to Bondholders on 22 March 2016. Due to a calculation error, the numbers are recalculated below. The

<<<

 timeline for the payments will be the same.
A Payment to Bondholders of USD 14,500,000 will be made as described below, subject to approval of the Release in the Bondholders' Meeting on 30 March 2016.
The record date for the payments will be

 end of business 29 March 2016 (the "Record Date").

<<<

2016 (the "February 2016 Coupon Claim"), the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) has registered separate claims (together the "Coupon Claims") that can be traded independently of the principal claim ("Principal Claim") in the Norwegian

<<<

 market. Settlement of trades in the Norwegian market will by default not include the Coupon Claim unless it is manually transferred account-toaccount. Hence, buyers of the principal claim since the relevant ex coupon dates (the "Relevant Ex

<<<

 Coupon Date") may not receive the payments related to the Coupon Claims. Any disputes with respect to the payments related to the Coupon Claims need to be settled between the parties of the transaction agreement assisted by the broker of the

<<<

 transaction.
The payments will be made pro rata to the holders of the Principal Claim and holders of the Coupon Claims as of the Record Date (and not the Relevant Ex Coupon Dates).
Settlement is expected to be on or about 31 March 2016.
