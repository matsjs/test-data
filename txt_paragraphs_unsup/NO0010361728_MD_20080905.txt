i2 RUBICON OFFSHORE INTERNATIONAL
Rubicon Offshore Holdings Limited Group Management Financial Statements For the six months ended 30 June 2008
Background Rubicon is an offshore oilfield service company providing life-of-field development solutions

<<<

 by deploying its fleet of two floating, production, storage and off-loading vessels ("FPSOs") and a multi-service vessel ("MSV"). Management review Rubicon is pleased to report that it has made considerable further progress in the transitioning

<<<

 of its two FPSOs into operations and that its MSV, the Rubicon Maverick continues to perform well. The Rubicon Intrepid arrived at the Galoc Field, offshore the Philippines, on 11 May 2008 for hook-up to the subsea equipment. Certification

<<<

 from the classification society, DNV, that the vessel was ready for the introduction of hydrocarbons was duly received on 6 June 2008. Thereafter, following successful pre-commissioning activities, progress to first oil was impacted by Typhoon

<<<

 Fengshen, necessitating a disconnection of the vessel on 21 June 2008. This procedure, which had. to be conducted in extremely adverse weather conditions,, resulted in damage being sustained to the mooring system, as well as an upper section

<<<

 of the riser. Rubicon declared force majeure under the FPSO charter contract and has since been working, together with GPC, the operator of the Galoc Field, to repair the damage to the vessel and subsea equipment. The required repair work is

<<<

 expected to be completed within the next few weeks, at which point, the force majeure situation will have been rectified and the vessel will once more be in a position to produce first oil. Following her departure from Singapore in May 200

<<<

8, the Rubicon Vantage sailed to Thailand for completion of outstanding work on the vessel, which was undertaken in the port of Sattahip. The vessel then departed for the Bualuang Field, offshore Thailand. Following arrival at the field on 

<<<

21 July 2008, the vessel underwent final pre-commissioning and testing, progressing to hook-up to the mooring and riser equipment and class certification by DNV. First oil was achieved on 27 August 2008.

RRUBICON OFFSHORE INTERNATIONAL
As previously reported, the Rubicon Maverick commenced a short-term contract with a division of China National Overseas Oil Corporation ("CNOOC") in mid-June 2008. Following successful

<<<

 completion of its work programme, the vessel was subsequently contracted, without any break, to perform additional work for an affiliate of CNOOC. This new contract is for up to 60 days (30 days firm period) and is ongoing. Rubicon is pleased

<<<

 with the contracts that have been secured to date and has been greatly encouraged by the interest shown by potential future customers for the Rubicon Maverick. The transition of Rubicon's FPSOs moving into production has occurred later than

<<<

 originally planned, due to a combination of factors, some of which have been outside Rubicon's control. The delay in receipt of revenues has had an impact on cashflows, eased somewhat by the successful deployment of the Rubicon Maverick. Rubicon

<<<

's shareholders have continued to be highly supportive as the Company has transitioned into operations and have provided additional capital, including the capitalization of US$15.0 million of shareholder loans in the period ended 30 June 20

<<<

08. We have continued to build up Rubicon's management team and made a number of staff additions. Our current headcount of permanent, staff in Singapore has now reached 50 professionals. Our most important recent hire has been the appointment

<<<

 of Joe Lesiuk as Rubicon's Chief Operating Officer. He brings to Rubicon many years' experience in the offshore oil industry and was, most recently, head of Transocean's Asia-Pacific operations. Board of Directors, 29 August 2008
