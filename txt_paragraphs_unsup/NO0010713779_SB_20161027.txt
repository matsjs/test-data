 Bond Issue 2014/2016

Notice of a Written Bondholders' Resolution

Oslo, 27 October 2016

1. NOTICE OF A WRITTEN BONDHOLDERS' RESOLUTION

Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders

<<<

") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue" or the "Bonds") in respect of which Xcite Energy Resources pic (formerly Xcite Energy Resources Limited) (the "Issuer") is the issuer and Xcite Energy Limited (the "Parent") is the guarantor

<<<

.

All capitalised terms used in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 27 June 2014 (as amended and/or restated from time to time) and made between the Issuer, the Parent and the Bond

<<<

 Trustee (the "Bond Agreement") unless otherwise stated herein.

The Bond Trustee has issued this request for a written Bondholders' resolution under Clause 16.5 ( Written Resolution) of the Bond Agreement pursuant to a written request from

<<<

 Bondholders representing more than 10% of the Voting Bonds under Clause 16.2.1(b) of the Bond Agreement.

2.

BACKGROUND

As was explained in the notice of a written bondholders' resolution dated 27 September 2016, the Issuer has been in discussions

<<<

 with an `ad hoc' committee of Bondholders holding in excess of 97% of the Bonds (the "Committee Bondholders") with respect to a potential restructuring of the Bonds (the "Consensual Restructuring"). As the Committee Bondholders were not satisfied

<<<

 that such a transaction was capable of being implemented in a manner acceptable to them, it is no longer being pursued.

This Summons contains resolutions to instruct the Bond Trustee to make demand on the Parent for repayment in full of the

<<<

 Outstanding Bonds and any interest accrued thereon under the guarantee it has provided in respect of the Bond Agreement (the "XEL Guarantee"), and to apply to court in the British Virgin Islands (the "BVI") for the appointment to the Parent

<<<

 of Chad Griffin of FTI Consulting LLP and Ian Morton of FTI Consulting (BVI) Limited as liquidators (the "Proposed Liquidators") pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Insolvency Act 2003 and the Insolvency Rules 2005 of the BVI (subject

<<<

 to satisfaction of any conditions which the Proposed Liquidators may have to such appointment being made) (the "Liquidator Appointment").

Each Committee Bondholder has confirmed that it will vote in favour of the Proposed Resolution.

SUMMARY OF LIQUIDATOR APPOINTMENT

3.1 XEL Demand and Application

The Maturity Date of the Outstanding Bonds is 31 October 2016. The Voting Deadline (as defined below

<<<

) is on 1 November 2016 and therefore after the Maturity Date of the Outstanding Bonds. The Outstanding Bonds will therefore have already become due and payable by the Voting Deadline. If the Proposed Resolution is approved, the Bond Trustee

<<<

 will make a demand under the XEL Guarantee for the repayment in full o f the Outstanding Bonds (including all interest accrued thereon) (the "XEL Demand").

In the event that the Parent fails to repay the Outstanding Bonds (including all interest

<<<

 accrued thereon) in accordance with the terms of the XEL Demand within three Business Days or otherwise confirms in writing to the Bond Trustee that it is unable to make such repayment, the Bond Trustee will immediately thereafter make an originating

<<<

 application to the courts o f the BVI for the appointment of the Proposed Liquidators to the Parent (the "Application"). The Application will be accompanied by a supporting affidavit prepared by the Bond Trustee (the "Affidavit"), which would

<<<

 itself append written confirmation from each of the Proposed Liquidators that they consent to act as liquidators o f the Parent, in the standard form (the "Consents").

If the Proposed Resolution is approved, the Bond Trustee would also:



<<<

(i) serve a sealed copy of the Application, together with the Affidavit (which would append the Consents) on the Parent at its registered office at least 14 days before the date fixed for the hearing of the Application (the "Service of Application

<<<

"); and

(ii) advertise the Application in the Virgin Islands Gazette and such newspapers as the Bond Trustee considers appropriate in each jurisdiction that the Parent is expected to have creditors no earlier than seven days after the Application

<<<

 has been served on the Parent and not less than seven days before the date on which the Application will be heard (the "Advertising").

For the avoidance of doubt, the Bond Trustee does not intend to take any steps to place the Issuer into

<<<

 any form of insolvency process. The Bond Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Bondholders) reserves the right to take any further actions not contemplated in this Summons.

3.2 Court hearing

A court hearing date will be fixed when the

<<<

 Application is filed at the BVI court. Hearings at the BVI court in respect of liquidation applications take place on fixed dates each month, and it is anticipated that the Application will be heard at the BVI court on 5 December 2016.

At

<<<

 the court hearing, the court has a broad range of options available to it, including the power to (i)make an interim order or other order as it sees fit; (ii) appoint a liquidator; (iii) dismiss the Application; or (iv) adjourn the hearing

<<<

 conditionally or unconditionally. If the court grants the Application, the Proposed Liquidators will be appointed and their appointment would become effective immediately. In the present circumstances, it is expected that the Application will

<<<

 be granted and the court will confirm the appointment o f the Proposed Liquidators.

Following the court hearing, the Proposed Liquidators, as the newly-appointed liquidators of the Parent (the "Liquidators"), will (i) advertise their appointment

<<<

 in the Gazette, a BVI newspaper and a newspaper published in the Parent's principal place of business; (ii) file a notice o f their appointment with the Registry of Corporate Affairs of the BVI; and (iii) serve notice of their appointment on

<<<

 the Parent at its registered office, in each case within 14 days of their appointment.

The directors of the Issuer and the Parent have confirmed that they will not object to the Application or the Liquidator Appointment. The Liquidator

<<<

 Appointment is subject to satisfaction of any conditions which the Proposed Liquidators may have to such appointment being made.

4.
