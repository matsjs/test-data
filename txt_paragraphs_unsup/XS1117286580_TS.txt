RISK FACTORS
Prospective investors should read the entire

<<<

 Prospectus and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.

The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. All of these factors are contingencies that may

<<<

 or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring.

Factors which the Issuer believes may be material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the

<<<

 Notes are also described below.

The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection

<<<

 with the Notes for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it and which it may not currently be able to anticipate.
The following is a general discussion of certain

<<<

 risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership of the Notes. In particular, it does not consider an investor's specific knowledge and/or understanding about risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition

<<<

 and ownership of the Notes, whether obtained through experience, training or otherwise, or the lack of such specific knowledge and/or understanding, or circumstances that may apply to a particular investor.
Words and expressions defined in

<<<

 the "Terms and Conditions of the Notes" below or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same meanings in this section, unless otherwise stated. References to a numbered "Condition" shall be to the relevant Condition in the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 of the Notes.

Risks relating to the Issuer and the Danica Group

Factors that may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes

The Issuer is a Danish life insurance company and parent company of, inter alia, two operating

<<<

 life insurance companies in Norway and Sweden, respectively. The Danica Pension Group is exposed to a number of risks, the categories of which are financial risks, insurance and pension risks, operational risks, business risks and regulatory

<<<

 risks.

Financial risks

Financial risks faced by the Issuer are predominantly investment risks relating to volatility in financial markets and/or macroeconomic factors which impact the results of operations and the financial condition of the

<<<

 Issuer.

Financial risks are managed on the following levels:



Assets allocated to customers' funds and life insurance obligations in conventional life insurance business

("Danica Traditionel"), where the financial risks concern the relationship

<<<

 between the investment

securities and the life insurance obligations. Danica Traditionel insurance policies offer guaranteed

benefits calculated on the basis of interest rates (technical rates). The guaranteed benefits apply to all

future

<<<

 ordinary payments as well as current savings and guarantees under issued policies, and is based on

a technical rate. Until 1994, the technical rate was 4.5 per cent. per annum. From 1994 to 1999, the

technical rate was 2.5 per cent. per annum

<<<

, from 1999 to 2011, the technical rate was 1.5 per cent. per

annum, and since 2011, the technical rate of interest has been 0.5 per cent. per annum. The policyholders'

savings earn a rate of interest that is set at the discretion of the Issuer

<<<

, and which can be changed at any

time. The difference between the technical rate and the actual interest rate accrued on policyholders'

savings is called a "bonus". The interest rate paid to policyholders for the six months ended 30 June

<<<

 2015

was 1.8 per cent. before tax and for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 1.8 per cent. before tax.

11

Interest rates paid to policyholders above or below investment return rates will, respectively, strengthen or weaken the collective

<<<

 bonus potential. If the future returns on assets allocated to customers' savings are inadequate to cover these guaranteed benefit levels, the Issuer will be required to set aside additional reserves to cover such guarantees. If such reserve

<<<

 strengthening cannot be covered first by the collective bonus potential and then by the bonus potential of paid-up policies, the remaining deficit will be provided by funds allocated from shareholders' equity of the Issuer.



Assets allocated

<<<

 to the Issuer's outstanding claims provisions. The outstanding claims provisions are

based on technical rates meaning that provisions have to be strengthened in case of a decline in the

interest rate level. If the increase in provisions is

<<<

 not covered by the actual investment return, the

remaining deficit will be provided by funds allocated from shareholders' equity of the Issuer.



Assets allocated to shareholders' equity. The return on these assets has a full impact on the

 Issuer's

financial results and consequently, negative investment returns will reduce shareholders' equity of the

Issuer.



Assets related to unit-linked contracts with a guarantee. By default, unit-linked contracts are

unguaranteed, but

<<<

 customers have the option to buy a guarantee. The guarantee is managed through the

investment strategy and by means of derivatives. If the investment return is insufficient to cover the

guarantees, it will impact the Issuer's financial results

<<<

 and reduce shareholders' equity of the Issuer.

Financial risks comprises market risks, liquidity risks, counterparty risks and concentration risks.

Market risks

Market risk is the risk of loss due to the market value of the Issuer's assets

<<<

 and liabilities varying according to changes in market conditions as outlined below:



Interest rate risks

The Issuer's investment assets are measured at fair value, and life insurance provisions are calculated for each insurance policy at

<<<

 market value on the basis of a market based zero-coupon yield curve. To ensure a correspondence between the return on investments and the guaranteed benefits, the financial risks are continually monitored. The interest rate risk on the guaranteed

<<<

 benefits of the conventional product is managed and hedged using bonds and interest rate derivatives. However, for periods of time with low or negative interest rates, it is not always possible or, in certain cases, desirable, for the Issuer

<<<

 to match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability cash flows, and even when matched, considerable basis risk may remain. As a result, asset-liability mismatch could exist and interest rate fluctuations will therefore impact the Issuer

<<<

's financial results and financial conditions, and such impact could be material. As a result of fluctuations in interest rates, the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions could be more volatile.



Equity market risks (including

<<<

 risk related to alternative investments)

Investments in equities are generally subject to greater risk and more volatility than fixed income securities. General economic conditions, stock market conditions and many other factors beyond the

<<<

 Issuer's control may adversely affect the equity markets. In the event of future equity market declines, the Issuer can provide no assurance as to the amount or timing of future unrealised losses or impairments of its equity investments, which

<<<

 may, in each case, materially adversely impact the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions.

The Issuer invests in both listed equities and unlisted equities (alternative investments). The Issuer's listed equity investment assets

<<<

 are marked to market on an ongoing basis, and its equity investment portfolio is therefore affected by fluctuations in equity prices. Unquoted equities are valued at fair value by the Issuer.

12



Risks related to property investments

A

<<<

 part of the Issuer's investment assets are placed in properties with a concentration in the Danish market. Any deterioration in the Danish property market may materially adversely impact the Issuer's financial results and financial condition

<<<

. As of year-end 2014, the Issuer's property exposure was mainly related to shopping centres and office buildings.

Key risks in relation to investments in shopping centres are:



development of new shopping centres that compete within the

<<<

 same geographical areas;



competition from other retail channels including e-commerce;



structural shifts in tenant demands (e.g. polarization between highly frequented and less

frequented locations); and



increasing requirements for

<<<

 capital investments in existing shopping centres.

Key risks in relation to investments in office buildings are:



increasing requirements for capital investments in existing properties;



structural shifts in tenant demand from regional

<<<

/suburban locations towards central locations, or

from car-oriented locations to locations with close proximity to public transportation hubs; and



structural shifts from less efficient/older building layouts to new buildings with the ability

<<<

 to

provide higher efficiency in terms of square metre per employee.



Risks related to the fair values of investments

Whenever possible, the fair values of investments, which also includes equities, are based on quoted market prices. If

<<<

 there is no quoted market price available, valuation is based on valuation models. These valuation techniques are subjective in nature and involve various assumptions about the relevant pricing factors.

The fair values of investments correspond

<<<

 with the price that would be expected to be received if one were selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Consequently, the fair values of the Issuer's investments may not be indicative

<<<

 of the net realisable value. In addition, the calculation of the estimated fair value is based on market conditions at a specific point in time and may not be indicative of future fair values. Changes in the valuations may have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions.



Currency risks

Currency risks are the risk of losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates. The Issuer prepares its accounts in Danish Kroner, and most of the liabilities

<<<

 of the Danica Group are denominated in Danish Kroner. Some of the invested assets are denominated in other currencies, but are not necessarily hedged against Danish Kroner. Consequently, fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on

<<<

 the investment return which can negatively affect the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions.



Credit spread risks

Credit spread risks are the risk that the value of an interest-related asset changes because investors' preferences

<<<

 for that asset have changed compared to other interest-related assets. The risk materialises if the spread between the asset specific discounting curve and the discounting curves for other interestrelated assets is extended or reduced.

13

<<<



Changes in spreads can have an impact on the investment return which can negatively affect the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions.
Liquidity risks
Liquidity risk is the risk of losses as a result of being forced to sell assets

<<<

 below fair value within a short timeframe in order to generate cash to pay liabilities.
The Issuer requires liquidity in order to meet obligations in relation to pension payments, claims payments, operating expenses and other financial obligations

<<<

. The Issuer's principal sources of liquidity are insurance premiums, deposit funds, and the cash flow from its investment portfolios and liquid assets, i.e. assets that are readily convertible into cash.
From time to time, the capital and credit

<<<

 markets experience increased volatility and disruption. In some cases, this has exerted a downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity. Furthermore, it can be difficult to sell unlisted shares and property investments

<<<

 at fair value, particularly when the transaction has to be accomplished within a short timeframe.
Counterparty risks
The Issuer is exposed to counterparty risks which are the risks of losses because counterparties default on their obligations

<<<

.
Such counterparty risk may be caused by deterioration in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of, or default by, issuers of the securities or other financial instruments forming part of the Issuer's investments to meet its obligations

<<<

. For instance, assets held to meet obligations to policyholders include government bonds, mortgage bonds, corporate bonds and other debt securities. Counterparty risk may also include the risk of trading counterparties failing to meet all or

<<<

 part of their obligations, such as derivative counterparties or security borrowers failing to pay as required. Counterparty defaults could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's financial results and financial condition.
An increase

<<<

 in credit spreads would generally lead to a decrease in market value of the investments, which could have a material adverse impact on the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions.
Securities lending
The Issuer engages in securities

<<<

 lending activities, whereby the Issuer lends equity and debt securities from its portfolios to counterparties that use the borrowed securities in their securities trading activities. In securities lending transactions, the legal title of the

<<<

 securities passes from the lender to the borrower. In order to minimise the possibility of default, the Issuer seeks to lend securities only to high-quality borrowers based on preset credit limits for each borrower. However, borrowers may still

<<<

 default on their securities-redelivery obligations to the Issuer due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, fraud, governmental intervention or other reasons. While the Issuer mitigates counterparty risk by requiring

<<<

 collateral to support the obligations of counterparties, there is a risk that the collateral obtained will not be sufficient or effective in all circumstances in order to protect against those risks.
Sovereign risks
A number of countries, particularly

<<<

 in the peripheral Eurozone and emerging market countries, currently have high levels of sovereign indebtedness. Concern over the ability of certain countries to service their sovereign indebtedness has on numerous occasions resulted in increases

<<<

 in the yields on their debt, and thus reduced the trading prices of their issued sovereign debt. To the extent that these concerns reappear or worsen, yields on sovereign debt could rise and trading prices could fall further. In addition, there

<<<

 is a risk that certain countries will default on their sovereign indebtedness or adopt inflationary policies which seek to reduce their real levels of indebtedness. The Issuer has both directly and indirectly (via fund of funds) investments

<<<

 in government bonds
14

from some of these countries. Any of these factors could have an impact on the investment return which may negatively affect the financial results of the Issuer.
Concentration risks
Concentration risk is the risk of

<<<

 losses as a result of high exposure to limited asset classes, industries and counterparts. In general, the Issuer seeks to have a well-diversified investment portfolio which reduces concentration risk. However defaults or poor performance in

<<<

 a single asset class or industry or for a single counterparty may have an impact on the investment return which may negatively affect the financial results of the Issuer.
Insurance and pension risks
Insurance risk relates to underwriting and

<<<

 pricing of insurance products, including inadequate premiums to cover claims and the need to build up buffers. In particular, insurance risk is affected by the development in mortality and disability rates. An increase in life expectancy affects

<<<

 the time during which pensions are payable under certain pension products, whereas the fluctuations in the numbers of deaths, disabilities and subsequent recoveries affects the benefits paid under insurance policies covering death and disability

<<<

.
Mortality, longevity and disability expectations are based on historical data from the Issuer's own insurance portfolio. In addition, the DFSA has introduced a benchmark for current mortality and longevity expectations. Best estimates on mortality

<<<

 and longevity are therefore calculated by a statistical method defined by the DFSA that describes a weighted average of the DFSA's benchmark and the Issuer's own results. The DFSA's benchmark for the current mortality rate is based on actual

<<<

 mortalities during the recent years for a number of Danish pension companies, while the benchmark for longevity is determined by the average improvements in lifeexpectancy in Denmark over the last 30 years.
Life insurance provisions are calculated

<<<

 at market value with future benefits being discounted to their present values. Life insurance provisions are calculated on expectations, including expectations as to mortality, longevity and disability. The expectations are based on historical

<<<

 and statistical data. Changes in expectations, including changes in longevity, mortality or disability assumptions, may adversely affect the results of the Issuer.
Regular actuarial analyses of the various risk elements are made in connection

<<<

 with the computation of insurance obligations and the determination of any measures to be taken.
For example, if improvements in longevity in Denmark in the coming years continue at the same level as in the past 15 years, then they will exceed

<<<

 the improvements of the DFSA's benchmark which is a part of the Issuer's model to calculate mortality and longevity expectations. In that case, the Issuer's provisions are not sufficient and consequently, it will be necessary to strengthen

<<<

 the provisions. This is what has happened in recent years, when the Issuer's provisions had to be strengthened with up to DKK 0.5 billion annually. This has reduced the bonus potential (customer buffer) each year. If it is not possible to cover

<<<

 this provision strengthening by the bonus potential, then it will result in a loss to shareholders' equity of the Issuer.
The low level of interest rates increases focus on bonus distributions to prevent redistributions of major amounts between

<<<

 the various groups of insurance. This applies to insurance policies written before 1 July 1994, on which the guaranteed benefits were calculated based on a technical rate of interest of 4.5 per cent., and for insurance policies written subsequently

<<<

, on which the guaranteed benefits were calculated based on technical rates of interest of 2.5 per cent., 1.5 per cent. or 0.5 per cent.
The Issuer has introduced the account strengthening ("kontostyrkelse") concept which constitutes nonguaranteed

<<<

 reserves to secure the policyholders' guaranteed benefits. The kontostyrkelse applies to insurance benefits based on a rate of interest of 4.5 per cent. or 2.5 per cent. Revaluations may therefore be earmarked to compensate for investment returns

<<<

 below the guaranteed benefits. The kontostyrkelse reserves are added to the individual insurance account and will, under normal circumstances, be included in the transfer value if a customer wants to transfer savings to another scheme or decides

<<<

 to have savings disbursed before the agreed date.
15

In order to reduce insurance risks, risk relating to deaths and disability is reinsured for any amounts above DKK 10 million by an individual reinsurance program.

Catastrophes such as

<<<

 terror, earthquakes, airplane crashes, pandemics or other accidents could cause a large number of casualties, resulting in unusually high pay-outs by the Issuer. To limit the risks the Issuer has covered such risks through reinsurance on a

<<<

 portfolio basis. The Issuer has no reinsurance against pandemics.

Operational risks

Operational risks primarily affect the Issuer financially through costs, for example caused by damages or injuries to customers. Compliance risks that have

<<<

 an economic impact fall within the definition of operational risk.

The Issuer's main operational risks are:



failure to comply with agreements;



faulty calculation systems;



errors in customer documents;



failure to comply with regulatory

<<<

 requirements;



errors in the calculation and distribution of provisions; and



incorrect calculation of asset-liability management risk.

Changes in critical accounting estimates and assumptions

Whenever possible, the fair values of investments

<<<

 are based on quoted market prices. If there is no quoted market price available, the Issuer uses valuation techniques which are based on market prices of comparable instruments or parameters from comparable active markets. If no observable

<<<

 market inputs are available, valuation models are used. These valuation techniques are subjective in nature and involve various assumptions about the relevant pricing factors. Misjudgements or changes in these assumptions could significantly

<<<

 affect the estimated fair values.

Other areas, that require the Issuer to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts, are mortality, disability and surrender rates. If these estimates and assumptions are wrong or inaccurate

<<<

, or have been wrong or inaccurate in the past, it could have a negative impact on reported profits in the future. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations

<<<

 of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Failure in risk management framework

The Issuer's risk management framework is essential to the Issuer's ability to oversee and manage risks related to the business

<<<

. Consequently, the Issuer is exposed to unidentified, unanticipated or incorrectly quantified risks, which could lead to material losses or material increases in liabilities.

Business risks

In the future there is a risk that the Issuer will

<<<

 not be able to attract new customers or hold on to existing customers. This could lead to a reduction in both premiums (including investment contracts) and provisions, and thereby reduce its earnings capacity. This could be a consequence of

<<<

 the general economic and business conditions, the Issuer's strategy, the competition in the Danish life insurance market or the Issuer's reputation in the market or other reasons.

16

Risks related to the general economic and business conditions

<<<


The Danica Group has activities in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, however for the most part, the Danica Group's activities are mainly related to the Danish market. Consequently, the general economic and business conditions particularly in Denmark

<<<

 have an impact on the Issuer's business, and changes in these conditions could have an adverse effect on the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions.
For example, recession, an increasing unemployment rate, a low confidence in the

<<<

 future or global events like war or terror can have a negative impact on the Issuer's business because they can affect the willingness and ability of the customers to pay their premiums. Changes to customers' behaviour could also be caused

<<<

 by changes in tax laws or regulations related to state pensions, which could also have an impact on the Issuer's business. The general economic conditions may also affect the financial markets and thereby adversely affect the value of the Issuer

<<<

's investments.
Strategic risks
The Issuer's strategies, and activities chosen to implement the strategies, are important for the future competitive position and thereby the future financial results and financial condition of the Issuer.
The

<<<

 Issuer closely monitors the developments in the market in order to ensure its competitiveness, but there is a risk that the market develops in an unforeseen direction which could have a negative impact on the Issuer's competitive position.

<<<


Furthermore, even if the Issuer pursues a prudent strategy, there is a risk that the Issuer will not succeed in the implementation of that strategy, for example because the activities associated with the implementation are insufficient or time

<<<

 to market is too long compared to initiatives taken by competitors. This could also have a negative impact on the Issuer's competitive positions.
Competition
The Issuer competes in the market for both company pension schemes and private pension

<<<

 savings. The Issuer faces competition from other life insurance companies operating in Denmark, and from the bank sector's pension savings products in relation to private pension savings. In both markets, the most important competitive factors

<<<

 include product prices, the level of investment returns, focus on processing time towards customers and focus on the general level of advice, service and accessibility.
If the Issuer is unable or is perceived to be unable to compete effectively

<<<

 as to one or more of these factors, its competitive position may be adversely affected. This could have a negative impact on the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions. A weakening of the competitive position could make it difficult

<<<

 to attract new customers. This could also have a negative impact on the Issuer's ability to sustain existing customers, particularly if a company were to change to another pension scheme provider. In such cases future premium payments will

<<<

, and current savings could be, transferred away from the Issuer to the new pension scheme provider. In addition, private customers always have the option to choose another pension savings provider. It could have a negative impact on the Issuer

<<<

's business if either a few key customers, each with a substantial business volume, decided to leave the Issuer, or if a larger number of customers, each with a smaller business volume decided to leave the Issuer.
The Issuer's competitive position

<<<

 also depends on a well-functioning distribution network. Today, the Issuer's products are mainly marketed through the Issuer's own sales force, branches of Danske Bank A/S and brokers. If the Issuer is not able to maintain a competitive distribution

<<<

 network, it could adversely impact the Issuer's future financial results and financial condition.
In the years to come, the importance of the internet and digital platforms (including social media) is likely to have a growing impact on the

<<<

 distribution of insurance policies and on customer service (including selfservice). If the Issuer is not able to develop the right digital solutions on the right electronic platforms, it could
17

affect the competitive position and have a

<<<

 negative impact on distribution power and the future earnings capacity of the Issuer.

The entry into, or the targeting of, the Danish life insurance market by international insurers with greater financial resources than the Issuer could affect

<<<

 the Issuer's ability to attract and retain existing customers. The Danish life and pensions market is relatively small compared to other European countries. Currently there is little international presence in the Danish life and pensions market

<<<

, due in part to the tax rules concerning policyholders' premiums and savings deductibility. Potential changes in the tax rules for Danish pension savings and taxes on pension returns may increase competition from international insurers.

In

<<<

 recent years, life insurance companies operating in Denmark have suffered substantial losses on their health and accident businesses. This is due to two things in particular: firstly, claims have increased significantly, in particular claims

<<<

 relating to psychological disorders, not least stress, have increased significantly in the past few years; and secondly, increased price competition has meant that the development in the price of insurance has not matched the rise in claims

<<<

. This will probably continue in the years to come leading to significant, yearly losses on the Issuer's health and accident business.

Reputational risks

The Issuer's reputation and image impact its ability to retain existing customers and

<<<

 attract new customers which can also have an impact on the Issuer's financial results. The Issuer is committed to treating customers fairly and communicating openly and transparently with both customers and other stakeholders. The Issuer's

<<<

 values are based on the premise that responsible business conduct is a prerequisite for a company's longterm value creation, and thus it has focus on corporate responsibility and socially responsible investment principles.

Nevertheless, its

<<<

 reputation and image could be harmed by unsatisfactory investment returns on customer funds, unsatisfactory processing times, errors in the servicing of customers or the general appearance of the Issuer in the public opinion, no matter whether

<<<

 this is due to events under the Issuer's control or not.

Furthermore, the reputation of the Issuer can be affected ­ positively or negatively ­ by the reputation of Danske Bank A/S, who is the ultimate parent company of the Issuer (for more

<<<

 information please see the section "Description of the Issuer's Business").

A loss of reputation could have a negative impact on the Issuer's competitive position and the Issuer's ability to attract and retain key personnel.

Risks related

<<<

 to the performance of asset management

The Issuer is exposed to risks of poor asset management performance. This could either have a negative impact on the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions due to financial risks or have

<<<

 a negative impact on the Issuer's reputation and competitive position.

A poor asset management performance could be a consequence of, for example:



an inappropriate investment strategy, including strategies related to the allocation of assets

<<<

 to

different types of assets, the geographical allocation of assets or the hedging of financial risks; or



poor performance in the execution of the investment strategy.

Group risks

The Issuer owns life insurance subsidiaries in Norway

<<<

 and Sweden. The Issuer has no legal obligation to support the two subsidiaries with extra capital in case they should need it, no matter whether this is due to poor financial performance, changes in the regulatory framework in the two countries

<<<

 or other reasons. However, it is

18

important for the Issuer that customers and other stakeholders can trust the Issuer, and in order to maintain that trust and reputation, the current intention is that the two subsidiaries also have to

<<<

 be well capitalised in the future.
Regulatory risks
Changes in the legal and regulatory systems
The legal and regulatory systems in Denmark, Norway and Sweden as well as in the European Union have an impact on the Danica Group's business, and

<<<

 potential changes thereto could have material adverse effect on the Issuer's business.
The Issuer is subject to governmental regulation in Denmark, and the Issuer's ability to conduct its operations requires the holding and maintenance of certain

<<<

 licences, permissions or authorisations, as well as compliance with rules and regulations promulgated from time to time. The insurance laws and regulations applicable to the Issuer include among others the following: licences to operate life

<<<

 and pensions business; solvency requirements; the Contribution Principle; taxes on investment returns; and tax rules concerning policyholders' premiums and savings. The loss of any such licence or amendments to such regulations (or any action

<<<

 taken by an applicable regulator pursuant to such regulations) could potentially have an adverse effect on the business of the Issuer and its financial condition and results.
Inconsistent application of directives by regulators in different

<<<

 Member States of the European Union may place the Issuer's business at a competitive disadvantage. The inconsistent application of directives could concern accounting rules, solvency rules, tax rules or the legal and regulatory system in general

<<<

.
Change in accounting rules
Currently risk allowances can be booked only if the return on investment adjusted for the change in liabilities is greater than the value of the risk allowance. If risk allowances cannot be booked, they are transferred

<<<

 to the shadow account, which is a receivable not listed on the balance sheet that the Issuer has towards the customers. Amounts transferred to the shadow account can be booked in subsequent years if the return on investment is sufficient.
From

<<<

 1 January 2016 new accounting rules will be implemented for insurance companies in Denmark. Among other things, this means that the risk allowance can be booked if it does not exceed the sum of all individual and collective buffers. If risk

<<<

 allowance for the year cannot be booked, it is lost ­ i.e. no transfer to the shadow account. The shadow account as of year-end 2015 is written down over the next 5 years.
In Denmark the life and pension sectors have been under a mark-to-market

<<<

 accounting framework on both the asset and liability side since 2002. The market value of life insurance provisions is today based on a market based discounting curve published by the DFSA.
The new accounting rules as from 1 January 2016 are

<<<

 currently assessed to have no material impact on the annual result of either the Issuer or the Danica Group. Future changes in accounting rules and interpretations of relevant regulations could affect the Issuer's financial results and financial

<<<

 conditions.
Change in solvency rules
As of 1 January 2016, when the new Solvency II regulations are to be implemented in Europe, the discounting curves for market valuation of liabilities will be published by the European Insurance and Occupational

<<<

 Pensions Authority on a monthly basis. The Solvency II interest rate curve is on the same level as the current Danish curve but some of the technical changes to the construction of the curve introduce further volatility and challenge risk management

<<<

 further.
The challenges presented to the risk management of interest rate risk from the new curve could have a material effect on the Issuer's equity.
19

There are continuing uncertainties regarding the final implementing measures that will

<<<

 be adopted under the Solvency II regime and that could potentially have a negative impact on the Issuer's capital strength and its ability to meet its financial obligations. In particular, inconsistent application of Solvency II by regulators

<<<

 in different Member States of the European Union may place the Issuer's business at a competitive disadvantage if the rules are implemented less onerously in European Union countries in which the Issuer does not operate.
Future changes in solvency

<<<

 rules could affect the Issuer's capital strength and its ability to meet its financial obligations.
Change in tax laws
The Issuer is subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions. Changes in the applicable tax legislation, in the interpretation

<<<

 of existing tax laws, amendments to existing tax rates, or the introduction of new tax legislation, specifically with respect to taxation of insurance companies, could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's financial results and financial

<<<

 conditions. Generally, any breach of relevant tax legislation may result in adjustments of the taxable amount, and the payment of late interest, fines and penalties and could have a negative impact on the Issuer's effective tax rate, cash flow

<<<

 and financial results.
Future changes in tax legislation or its interpretation, when applied to products and services offered by the Issuer, could have a material adverse effect on customers' demands for these products and services.
Legal Proceedings

<<<


Owing to its size and business volume, the Issuer is continually a party to various lawsuits and disputes and has an on-going dialogue with public authorities such as the DFSA. In view of its size and business volume, the Issuer does not expect

<<<

 the outcome of pending lawsuits and disputes or its dialogue with public authorities to have any material effect on its financial position. However, pending and future lawsuits and disputes could have a material effect on the Issuer's financial

<<<

 results and financial conditions.
Competition and consumer protection legislation
The Issuer is required to comply with competition laws and regulations, including those relating to consumer protection, enforced by, among others, the European

<<<

 Commission. The competition laws and regulations applicable to the Issuer relate to matters such as price fixing, collusion and other forms of anticompetitive behaviour.
A determination that the Issuer has failed to comply with any applicable

<<<

 laws and/or regulations relating to matters of competition or consumer protection, or any regulatory action in respect thereof, could result in fines and losses, as well as adverse publicity for the Issuer. This could have a material impact

<<<

 on the Issuer's reputation as well as its business, results of operations and financial position.
Contribution Principle
The Issuer has to run its business in accordance with the Executive Order on the Contribution Principle. The principle

<<<

 has to ensure a fair distribution between the customers and the Issuer's shareholders and among the customers themselves. Consequently, the DFSA has been notified of the Issuer's profit policy and the portfolio of Danica Traditionel insurances

<<<

 is divided into four interest rate groups, four cost groups and three risk groups. Despite this, there is a risk that the DFSA or the courts in Denmark may conclude that the Issuer does not satisfy the Contribution Principle, which could negatively

<<<

 affect the Issuer's financial results and financial conditions.
Risks related to the market generally
Set out below is a brief description of certain market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit

<<<

 risk:
20

The secondary market generally
The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily

<<<

 or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of Notes.
Exchange rate risks and exchange controls

<<<


Payment of principal and interest on the Notes will be made in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor

<<<

's Currency") other than euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of euro or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over

<<<

 the Investor's Currency or euro may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to euro would decrease (i) the Investor's Currencyequivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currency

<<<

-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (iii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely

<<<

 affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal as measured in the Investor's

<<<

 Currency.
Interest rate risks
Notwithstanding that the rate of interest applicable to the Notes will be reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date thereafter, an investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in

<<<

 market interest rates during the Initial Period or, as the case may be, during a Reset Interest Period may adversely affect the value of the Notes.
In addition, a holder of securities with a fixed interest rate that will be periodically reset

<<<

 during the term of the relevant securities, such as the Notes, is also exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income.
Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated

<<<

 with the Notes
The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors
Each potential investor of the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should

<<<

:
(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement

<<<

 to this Prospectus including, but not limited to, any taxation issues related to purchasing and/or holding the Notes;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial

<<<

 situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where

<<<

 the currency for principal or interest payments, i.e. euro, is different from the currency in which such potential investor's financial activities are principally denominated;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar

<<<

 with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and
21

(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment

<<<

 and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Risks related to the structure of the Notes
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are subordinated
Subject to the reduction and cancellation provisions described in the risk factor "Reduction

<<<

 and Cancellation of Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes and Accrued but Unpaid Interest" below, the Notes will constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer as described in Condition 4 (Status of the Notes

<<<

).
The Issuer may issue other obligations or capital instruments that rank or are expressed to rank senior to the Notes or pari passu to the Notes, in each case as regards the right to receive periodic payments on a liquidation or bankruptcy

<<<

 of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer will be required to pay its policyholders and beneficiaries and

<<<

 any other unsubordinated creditors and its other creditors that rank or are expressed to rank senior to the Notes in full before it can make any payments on the Notes. If this occurs, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining after these

<<<

 payments are made to pay amounts due under the Notes. In addition, in the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, to the extent the Issuer has assets remaining after paying its senior creditors, payments relating to other obligations

<<<

 or capital instruments of the Issuer that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu to the Notes may, if there are insufficient assets to satisfy the claims of all of the Issuer's pari passu creditors, further reduce the assets available to

<<<

 pay amounts due under the Notes on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Reduction and Cancellation of Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes and Accrued but Unpaid Interest
Subject as provided in Condition 7 (Reduction or Cancellation

<<<

 of Principal and Unpaid Interest), prior to 1 January 2016, the Issuer may resolve to reduce and cancel part or all of the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes and part or all of any accrued but unpaid interest thereon (but excluding

<<<

 any interest which has been cancelled). The amount of such reduction shall be subject to the prior approval of the Issuer's elected external auditor and the Relevant Supervisory Authority. Investors should note that, while such reduction is

<<<

 not common, it is an appreciable risk and is not limited to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In addition, investors should note that, following any such reduction and cancellation, the relevant amount of the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amount or the relevant amount of accrued but unpaid interest so reduced and cancelled will not be reinstated in any circumstances.
Any actual or anticipated reduction and cancellation of the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes and any

<<<

 accrued but unpaid interest thereon prior to 1 January 2016 will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the reduction and cancellation provision of the Notes which applies until (but excluding

<<<

) 1 January 2016, the market price of the Notes prior to 1 January 2016 may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such reduction and cancellation and may be more sensitive

<<<

 generally to adverse changes in the financial condition of the Issuer and/or the Danica Pension Group and/or the Danica Group.
Interest payments under the Notes may be deferred in certain circumstances
The Issuer may defer a payment of interest

<<<

 (in whole but not in part) on any Optional Interest Payment Date. In addition, the Issuer is required to defer any payment of interest (in whole but not in part) on any Interest Payment Date on which a Mandatory Deferral Event has occurred

<<<

 and is continuing. A Mandatory Deferral Event will occur if, in relation to any date on which:
(i) a payment of interest is due to be made in respect of the Notes; and/or
(ii) a repayment of principal is due to be made in respect of the Notes

<<<

; and/or
(iii) the Notes are to be redeemed,
22

(as applicable), a Capital Adequacy Event has occurred and is continuing, or the relevant payment of interest and/or repayment of principal and/or redemption of the Notes (as applicable) would

<<<

 in itself cause a Capital Adequacy Event. Holders should note that, from and after 1 January 2016, the circumstances that could trigger a Capital Adequacy Event (and thus a Mandatory Deferral Event) relate to each of the Issuer, the Danica

<<<

 Pension Group and the Danica Group (and not just to the Issuer).
Any such deferral of interest will not constitute a default under the Notes for any purpose. Any interest so deferred shall, for so long as the same remains unpaid, constitute

<<<

 Arrears of Interest. Each amount of Arrears of Interest will bear interest at the prevailing Rate of Interest (such interest being defined herein as "Additional Interest Amounts"). Arrears of Interest (together with any Additional Interest

<<<

 Amounts but excluding any interest that has been cancelled) may, subject to certain conditions, be paid by the Issuer at any time, but in any event shall be payable by the Issuer on the earliest to occur of (a) 10 Business Days following a

<<<

 Compulsory Interest Payment Event, (b) the next Optional Interest Payment Date in respect of which the Issuer does not defer the relevant payment of interest, (c) the redemption of the Notes and (d) a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer

<<<

 as described in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. The Holders have no right to require payment of Arrears of Interest and/or any Additional Interest Amounts thereon.
Any actual or anticipated deferral of interest will be likely to have

<<<

 an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest deferral provisions of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest

<<<

 accrues that are not subject to such deferral and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the financial condition of the Issuer and/or the Danica Pension Group and/or the Danica Group. Holders should be aware that any announcement

<<<

 relating to the future deferral of interest payments or any actual deferral of interest payments may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. Holders may find it difficult to sell their Notes in such circumstances, or may only

<<<

 be able to sell their Notes at a price which may be significantly lower than the price at which they purchased their Notes. In such event, Holders may lose some or substantially all of their investment in the Notes.
Notes subject to optional

<<<

 redemption by the Issuer or upon the occurrence of a Special Event
Subject as provided herein, in particular to Condition 8.4 (Mandatory redemption deferral) and 8.8 (Conditions to redemption etc.), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all

<<<

, but not some only, of the Notes on the First Call Date or on any Interest Payment Date thereafter at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon and any Arrears of Interest (together with all corresponding Additional

<<<

 Interest Amounts but excluding any interest that has been cancelled). Subject as aforesaid, upon the occurrence of a Special Event, the Issuer may also, at its option, at any time redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes at their

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon and any Arrears of Interest (together with all corresponding Additional Interest Amounts but excluding any interest that has been cancelled).
An optional redemption feature

<<<

 is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also

<<<

 may be true prior to any redemption period.
The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption

<<<

 proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments

<<<

 available at that time.
The Notes are long term securities
The Maturity Date of the Notes is 29 September 2045 and, although the Issuer may redeem or purchase the Notes in certain special circumstances described herein prior to that date, the

<<<

 Issuer is under no obligation to do so. In addition, the Holders have no right to require the Issuer to redeem the Notes at the option of the Holders in any circumstances. Therefore, prospective investors should be aware that they may be required

<<<

 to bear the financial risks associated with an investment in long term securities. See also the risk factor "Redemption, including at the Maturity Date, and purchases of the Notes are subject to certain conditions and redemption payments under

<<<

 the Notes must be deferred in certain circumstances" below.
23

Redemption, including at the Maturity Date, and purchases of the Notes are subject to certain conditions and redemption payments under the Notes must be deferred in certain circumstances

<<<


Notwithstanding the scheduled maturity of the Notes on the Maturity Date, the Issuer must defer redemption of the Notes on the Maturity Date or on any other date set for redemption of the Notes if a Mandatory Deferral Event has occurred and

<<<

 is continuing on the relevant date of redemption. See "Interest payments under the Notes may be deferred in certain circumstances" above for a description of a Mandatory Deferral Event and Condition 8.4 (Mandatory redemption deferral). In addition

<<<

, any redemption of the Notes or any purchase of the Notes pursuant to Conditions 8.1 (Scheduled redemption), Condition 8.2 (Early redemption upon the occurrence of a Special Event), Condition 8.3 (Redemption at the option of the Issuer) or

<<<

 Condition 8.5 (Purchase), as the case may be, is subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, as provided in Condition 8.8 (Conditions to redemption etc.). In particular, the Notes may only be redeemed, purchased or cancelled (as applicable

<<<

) pursuant to such provisions (if and to the extent required or applicable in order for the Notes to be eligible to qualify as regulatory capital of the Issuer, the Danica Pension Group or the Danica Group under the Solvency Requirements), if

<<<

 no Insolvent Insurer Winding-up has occurred and is continuing on the relevant due date for repayment or redemption.
Any such deferral of redemption of the Notes will not constitute a default under the Notes. If a redemption of the Notes is

<<<

 deferred, subject to certain conditions, the Notes will be redeemed by the Issuer on the earliest of (a) 10 Business Days following the date on which the relevant Mandatory Deferral Event has ceased (provided that if, on such 10th Business

<<<

 Day, a further Mandatory Deferral Event has occurred and is continuing, the Notes shall not fall due for repayment or redemption on such date and the deferral provisions of Condition 8.4 (Mandatory redemption deferral) shall apply mutatis mutandis

<<<

 to determine the subsequent date for repayment or redemption of the Notes), (b) subject, in any case, as provided in Condition 8.4 (Mandatory redemption deferral), the date falling 10 Business Days following the date on which the conditions

<<<

 set out in Condition 8.8 (Conditions to redemption etc.) are fulfilled or (c) the date on which a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer occurs. Therefore, the Holders may receive their investment back at a point in time later than initially

<<<

 expected or not at all.
If the Notes are not redeemed for the reasons set out above, Holders will not receive any additional compensation as a result of the postponement of such redemption. For the avoidance of doubt, this statement does not

<<<

 affect the accrual of any Additional Interest Amounts in respect of any outstanding Arrears of Interest.
Any actual or anticipated deferral of redemption of the Notes will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition

<<<

, as a result of the redemption deferral provision of the Notes, including with respect to deferring redemption on the scheduled Maturity Date, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities

<<<

 without such deferral features, including dated securities where redemption on the scheduled maturity date cannot be deferred, and the Notes may accordingly be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the financial condition of the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Danica Pension Group and/or the Danica Group. Holders may also find it difficult to sell their Notes in such circumstances, or may only be able to sell their Notes at a price which may be significantly lower than the price at which

<<<

 they purchased their Notes. In such event, Holders may lose some or substantially all of their investment in the Notes.
Conditional substitution of the Notes without Holder consent
At any time, upon the occurrence of a Special Event unforeseen

<<<

 and outside the control of the Issuer, the Issuer may, at its option, and without the consent or approval of the Holders, elect either (i) to exchange or convert all (but not some only) of the Notes into an own-fund item which constitutes Qualifying

<<<

 Notes; or (ii) to repay or redeem all (but not some only) of the Notes out of the proceeds of a new basic own-fund item of at least the same quality, provided that, in any such case, the Issuer has received the prior written consent of the

<<<

 Relevant Supervisory Authority.
In the case of any repayment or redemption of the Notes as described in (ii) above, Holders should note the risks described in the risk factor above entitled "Notes subject to optional redemption by the Issuer

<<<

 or upon the occurrence of a Special Event".
24

In relation to any exchange or conversion of the Notes into an own-fund item which constitutes Qualifying Notes as described in (i) above Qualifying Notes are securities issued or guaranteed

<<<

 by the Issuer that have, inter alia, terms not materially less favourable to the Holders than the terms of the Notes (provided that the Issuer shall have delivered a certificate to that effect signed by two of its Directors to the Fiscal Agent

<<<

). There can be no assurance that, due to the particular circumstances of each Holder, any Qualifying Notes will be as favourable to each Holder in all respects or that, if it were entitled to do so, a particular Holder would make the same determination

<<<

 as the Issuer as to whether the terms of the relevant Qualifying Notes are not materially less favourable to Holders than the terms of the Notes.
See Condition 8.7 (Conditional Substitution).
Limited enforcement events
The Notes will contain

<<<

 limited enforcement events relating to:
(i) non-payment by the Issuer of any amounts due under the Notes. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) and subject as provided below, a Holder may institute

<<<

 proceedings in Denmark in order to recover the amounts due from the Issuer to such Holder; and
(ii) the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events), the Notes

<<<

 will become due and payable at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon and any Arrears of Interest (together with all corresponding Additional Interest Amounts but excluding any interest that has been cancelled

<<<

).
Even if the Issuer cannot meet its obligations regarding capital raised as subordinated loan capital, the Issuer will not be considered insolvent. Accordingly, a Holder of the Notes may not itself file for the liquidation or bankruptcy of

<<<

 the Issuer.
If proceedings with respect to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer should occur, the Holders of the Notes would be required to pursue their claims on such Notes in proceedings with respect to the Issuer in Denmark. In addition

<<<

, to the extent that the Holders are entitled to any recovery with respect to the Notes in any such Danish bankruptcy proceedings, such Holders would be entitled to a recovery in Danish Kroner or, as the case may be, other currencies, which

<<<

 would be based on the relevant conversion rate in effect on the date the Issuer entered into such liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings.
Risks related to the Notes generally
Because the Notes are held by or on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on the clearing system procedures for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the

<<<

 circumstances described in the Global Notes, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are in global

<<<

 form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.
While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by

<<<

 making payments to a common depositary. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility

<<<

 or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in such a Global Note.
Meetings of Holders and modification
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Holders

<<<

 to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Holders including
25

Holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Holders who voted in a manner contrary to

<<<

 the majority.
In addition, the Issuer may, subject to the Issuer having received the prior consent of the Relevant Supervisory Authority, make any modification to the Notes, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the Agency Agreement and/or

<<<

 the Deed of Covenant which is not prejudicial to the interests of the Holders without the consent of the Holders. Any such modification shall be binding on the Holders.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks and may be lowered, suspended

<<<

, withdrawn or not maintained
S&P is expected to assign a credit rating to the Notes. In addition, S&P has assigned a credit rating to the Issuer as described in "Overview of the Notes" above. These ratings may not reflect the potential impact

<<<

 of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes or the standing of the Issuer.
A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and any rating

<<<

 agency may revise, suspend or withdraw at any time the relevant rating assigned by it if, in the sole judgement of the relevant rating agency, among other things, the credit quality of the Notes or, as the case may be, the Issuer has declined

<<<

 or is in question. In addition, there is no guarantee that any rating of the Notes and/or the Issuer will be maintained by the Issuer following the date of this Prospectus. If any rating assigned to the Notes and/or the Issuer is revised lower

<<<

, suspended, withdrawn or not maintained by the Issuer, the market value of the Notes may be reduced.
The Issuer is exposed to changing methodology by rating agencies
The Issuer is exposed to changes in the rating methodologies applied by rating

<<<

 agencies. Any adverse changes of such methodologies may materially and adversely affect the Issuer's operations or financial condition, the Issuer's willingness or ability to leave individual transactions outstanding and adversely affect the

<<<

 Issuer's capital market standing.
Change of law
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes will be governed by the laws of England, except for Condition 4 (Status of the Notes), Condition 6 (Interest Deferral), Condition 7 (Reduction or Cancellation

<<<

 of Principal and Unpaid Interest), Condition 8.2 (Early redemption upon the occurrence of a Special Event), Condition 8.4 (Mandatory redemption deferral) and Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) which shall be governed by, and construed in accordance

<<<

 with, Danish law. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of England or Denmark or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act

<<<

 withholding may affect payments on the Notes
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") impose a new reporting regime and, potentially, a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to (i) certain payments

<<<

 from sources within the United States, (ii) "foreign pass thru payments" made to certain non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with this new reporting regime, and (iii) payments to certain investors that do not provide identification

<<<

 information with respect to interests issued by a participating non-U.S. financial institution. Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (together, the "ICSDs"), in all but the most remote circumstances

<<<

, it is not expected that FATCA will affect the amount of any payment received by the ICSDs. However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such

<<<

 custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under

<<<

 FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made

<<<

 free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any information

<<<

, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such
26

custodian or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has made payment to, or to the

<<<

 order of the common depositary for the ICSDs (as bearer of the Notes), and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the ICSDs and custodians or intermediaries. Further, foreign financial institutions

<<<

 in a jurisdiction which has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States (an "IGA") are generally not expected to be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) from payments they make.

<<<

 Prospective investors should refer to the section "Taxation ­ Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act." Notes where denominations involve integral multiples: Definitive Notes
The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum denomination of EUR

<<<

 100,000 plus one or more higher integral multiples of EUR 1,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples of EUR 100,000. In such a case a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds

<<<

 an amount which is less than EUR 100,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in respect of such holding (should Definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes such that its holding amounts to a denomination.
If Definitive Notes are issued, Holders should be aware that Definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of EUR 100,000 may be illiquid and

<<<

 difficult to trade. Interests of the Joint-Lead Managers
Certain of the Joint-Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future, engage in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform

<<<

 services for, the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.

<<<

 or any notice of any previous loss or theft thereof) and no Person shall be liable for so treating such Holder.

4.

Status of the Notes

The Notes (in Danish: "kapitalbeviser") will, on issue, be eligible to constitute subordinated loan capital

<<<

 (in Danish: "ansvarlig lånekapital") and, as of 1 January 2016, will be eligible to constitute Tier 2 Basic Own Funds (in Danish: "efterstillet gæld") of the Issuer, in each case within the meaning of the Solvency Requirements.

The Notes constitute

<<<

 direct, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, and will at all times rank:

(i) pari passu without any preference among themselves;

(ii) pari passu with (a) all other present and future subordinated loan capital of the

<<<

 Issuer (qualifying as ansvarlig lånekapital or Tier 2 Basic Own Funds, as applicable); and (b) any other obligations or capital instruments of the Issuer that rank or are expressed to rank equally with the Notes, in each case pursuant to the

<<<

 Solvency Requirements and in each case as regards the right to receive periodic payments on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer;

(iii) senior

<<<

 to holders of any Junior Securities, in each case as regards the right to receive periodic payments on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer; and

<<<



(iv) junior to present or future claims of (a) all policyholders and beneficiaries and any other unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer and (b) creditors in respect of any other obligations or instruments of the Issuer that rank or are expressed

<<<

 to rank senior to the Notes.

5.

Interest

5.1 Interest rate: The Notes bear interest on their Outstanding Principal Amounts at the relevant Rate of Interest from (and including) the Issue Date. Interest shall be payable annually in arrear

<<<

 on each Interest Payment Date, subject in any case as provided in Condition 6 (Interest Deferral), Condition 7 (Reduction or Cancellation of Principal and Unpaid Interest) and Condition 9 (Payments). The first payment of interest will be made

<<<

 on 29 September 2016 in respect of the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) 29 September 2016.

5.2 Accrual of interest: Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for final redemption unless, upon due

<<<

 presentation, payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount in respect thereof is improperly withheld or refused, in which case it will continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition (as well after as before judgment) until whichever

<<<

 is the earlier of:

43

(i) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Holder; and
(ii) the day which is seven days after the Fiscal Agent has notified the Holders in accordance

<<<

 with Condition 16 (Notices) that it has received all sums due in respect of the Notes up to such seventh day (except to the extent that there is any subsequent default in payment).
5.3 Interest to (but excluding) the First Call Date: Unless

<<<

 the Calculation Amount has been adjusted as described in the definition thereof, the amount of interest per Calculation Amount payable on each Interest Payment Date in relation to an Interest Period falling in the Initial Period will be EUR

<<<

 43.75.
If the Calculation Amount has been adjusted as described in the definition thereof, Condition 5.7 (Calculation of amount of interest per Calculation Amount) will apply.
5.4 Interest from (and including) the First Call Date: The rate

<<<

 of interest for each Interest Period from (and including) the First Call Date will be equal to the sum of (i) the Reference Rate in respect of the Reset Interest Period in which such Interest Period falls and (ii) the Margin, all as determined

<<<

 by the Fiscal Agent.
5.5 Determination of Reference Rate in relation to a Reset Interest Period: The Fiscal Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Reference Rate Determination Date in relation to a Reset

<<<

 Interest Period, determine the Reference Rate for such Reset Interest Period and calculate the amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on the Interest Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest

<<<

 Period (each a "Reset Interest Amount").
5.6 Publication of Reference Rate and Reset Interest Amount: With respect to each Reset Interest Period, the Fiscal Agent will cause the relevant Reference Rate and the relevant Reset Interest Amount

<<<

 determined by it, together with the relevant Interest Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period, to be notified to the Paying Agents and each listing authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system

<<<

 (if any) by which the Notes have then been admitted to listing, trading and/or quotation as soon as practicable after such determination but in any event not later than the relevant Reset Date. Notice thereof shall also promptly be given to

<<<

 the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices).
5.7 Calculation of amount of interest per Calculation Amount: Save as specified in Condition 5.3 (Interest to (but excluding) the First Call Date), the amount of interest payable in respect

<<<

 of the Calculation Amount (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Reset Interest Amount) for any period shall be calculated by:
(i) applying the applicable Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount;
(ii) multiplying the product thereof

<<<

 by the Day Count Fraction; and
(iii) rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being rounded upwards).
If, pursuant to Condition 7 (Reduction or Cancellation of Principal and Unpaid Interest), the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts are reduced during an Interest Period, the Calculation Amount will be adjusted by the Fiscal Agent to reflect such Outstanding Principal Amounts from time to time so that the relevant amount of interest is determined by reference to

<<<

 such Calculation Amount as adjusted from time to time, all as determined by the Fiscal Agent.
5.8 Calculation of amount of interest per Note: The amount of interest payable in respect of a Note shall be the product of:
(i) the amount of interest

<<<

 per Calculation Amount; and
(ii) the number by which the Original Calculation Amount is required to be multiplied to equal the denomination of such Note.
44

5.9 Notifications etc: All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates

<<<

, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of this Condition 5 by the Fiscal Agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Paying Agents, the Holders and the Couponholders

<<<

 and (subject as aforesaid) no liability to any such Person will attach to the Fiscal Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions for such purposes.

6.

Interest Deferral

6.1 Optional interest

<<<

 deferral: The Issuer may elect to defer a payment of interest (in whole but not in part) on an Optional Interest Payment Date.

6.2 Mandatory deferral of interest: A payment of interest in respect of the Notes will be mandatorily and automatically

<<<

 deferred (in whole but not in part) on a Mandatory Interest Deferral Date.

Notwithstanding that a Mandatory Deferral Event has occurred, the Issuer may make the relevant payment of interest if the Interest Payment Deferral Waiver Conditions

<<<

 are fulfilled.

6.3 Deferral not default: If a payment of interest is deferred pursuant to Condition 6.1 (Optional interest deferral) or Condition 6.2 (Mandatory deferral of interest), as the case may be, the amount of interest so deferred

<<<

 shall not become due and payable on the scheduled Interest Payment Date, the Issuer shall not have any obligation to make such payment on such date, and any such deferral and non-payment shall not constitute a default by the Issuer under the

<<<

 Notes or for any other purpose.

6.4 Effect of interest deferral: Following any deferral of interest as described above, any interest not paid on any Interest Payment Date pursuant to Condition 6.1 (Optional interest deferral) or Condition

<<<

 6.2 (Mandatory deferral of interest), as the case may be, shall, so long as the same remains unpaid, constitute "Arrears of Interest". Each amount of Arrears of Interest will bear interest at the prevailing Rate of Interest. The amount of such

<<<

 additional interest ("Additional Interest Amounts") will be calculated from (and including) the date on which (but for such deferral) the relevant Arrears of Interest would otherwise have been due to (but excluding) the date the relevant Arrears

<<<

 of Interest is paid and otherwise mutatis mutandis as provided in Condition 5 (Interest).

6.5 Payment of Arrears of Interest: Any Arrears of Interest (together with all corresponding Additional Interest Amounts but excluding any interest that

<<<

 has been cancelled prior to 1 January 2016 pursuant to Condition 7 (Reduction or Cancellation of Principal and Unpaid Interest)) may be paid by the Issuer, in whole or in part, at any time at its discretion, provided that, if a Mandatory Deferral

<<<

 Event has occurred and is continuing on the relevant payment date, the Interest Payment Deferral Waiver Conditions have been fulfilled.

Any Arrears of Interest (together with all corresponding Additional Interest Amounts but excluding any

<<<

 interest that has been cancelled prior to 1 January 2016, pursuant to Condition 7 (Reduction or Cancellation of Principal and Unpaid Interest)) will become due and payable, in whole but not in part, upon the earliest of:

(i) 10 Business Days

<<<

 following a Compulsory Interest Payment Event;

(ii) the next Optional Interest Payment Date in respect of which the Issuer does not defer the relevant payment of interest;

(iii) redemption of the Notes; and

(iv) a liquidation or bankruptcy

<<<

 of the Issuer,

provided that, in the case of (i) and (ii) above, if a Mandatory Deferral Event has occurred and is continuing on the relevant payment date, the Interest Payment Deferral Waiver Conditions have been fulfilled.
45

6.6 Notices

<<<

 and certificates: The Issuer shall give not less than five nor more than thirty Business Days' prior notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices):

(i) of any deferral of a payment of interest on an Optional Interest Payment

<<<

 Date or, as applicable, a Mandatory Interest Deferral Date or of the occurrence of a Mandatory Deferral Event, as the case may be; provided that:

(A) if a Mandatory Deferral Event occurs less than five Business Days before the relevant Interest

<<<

 Payment Date, the Issuer shall give such notice as soon as practicable under the circumstances on or before the relevant Interest Payment Date; and

(B) for the avoidance of doubt, any delay in giving such notice shall not result in such interest

<<<

 becoming due and payable on the relevant Interest Payment Date; and

(ii) of any date upon which amounts in respect of Arrears of Interest (together with any corresponding Additional Interest Amounts) are to be paid, which notice shall specify

<<<

 the Business Day on which such Arrears of Interest and corresponding Additional Interest Amounts (or part thereof) will (subject to no Mandatory Deferral Event having occurred and continuing as at such Business Day) be settled; provided that

<<<

 for the avoidance of doubt, any delay in giving such notice shall not result in the relevant Arrears of Interest and corresponding Additional Interest Amounts becoming due and payable as a result of such delay.

Prior to any Mandatory Interest

<<<

 Deferral Date, the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent (and copies thereof will be available at the Fiscal Agent's Specified Office during its normal office hours) a certificate signed by two of its Directors stating that a Mandatory Deferral

<<<

 Event has occurred and is continuing.

This Condition 7 shall only apply until (but excluding) 1 January 2016. Accordingly, on 1 January 2016, this Condition 7 shall automatically

<<<

 cease to apply and have no effect.

7.1 Reduction and cancellation: Pursuant to section 37 of the Executive Order on Base Capital, the Issuer, by a resolution passed at a general meeting of its shareholders duly convened in accordance with

<<<

 Danish law and the Issuer's Articles of Association, may resolve to reduce and cancel part or all of the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes and part or all of any accrued but unpaid interest thereon upon the occurrence of the circumstances

<<<

 set out in paragraphs (i) through (iii) below:

(i) the equity capital of the Issuer has been lost;

(ii) a general meeting of the shareholders of the Issuer has effectively resolved in accordance with Danish law and the Issuer's Articles of

<<<

 Association to reduce to zero the share capital of the Issuer; and

(iii) following the resolution referred to in (ii) above either (a) sufficient new share capital and/or other capital of the Issuer is subscribed or contributed so as to enable

<<<

 the Issuer, following any such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon (but excluding any interest which has been cancelled), to comply with the Solvency Requirements or (b) the

<<<

 Issuer discontinues its business without a loss to its nonsubordinated creditors.

7.2 Prior approval: The amount of any such reduction shall be subject to the prior approval of the Issuer's elected external auditor and the Relevant Supervisory

<<<

 Authority and shall first be effected, pro rata, in respect of any accrued but unpaid interest (but excluding any interest which has been cancelled) and only when there is no such outstanding accrued but unpaid interest (but excluding any interest

<<<

 which has been cancelled) will the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes be reduced.

46

7.3 Effective date and other matters: The reduction and cancellation will take effect on the date specified in the relevant resolution approving

<<<

 any such reduction and cancellation on the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon (but excluding any interest which has been cancelled) and Holders will thereafter cease to have any claim in respect

<<<

 of any amounts so reduced and cancelled. The Issuer will give notice of any such reduction and cancellation immediately following the passing of such resolution to the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices). To the extent that part

<<<

 only of the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes have been so reduced, interest will continue to accrue in accordance with the terms hereof on the then Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes.

8.

8.1 Scheduled

<<<

 redemption: Subject to Condition 8.4 (Mandatory redemption deferral) and Condition 8.8 (Conditions to redemption etc.), unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the Notes shall be redeemed on the Maturity Date at their Outstanding

<<<

 Notes at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with interest accrued to (but excluding) the date of redemption and any Arrears of Interest (together with all corresponding Additional Interest Amounts but excluding any interest that

<<<

 earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to pay such additional amounts as referred to in the definition of Tax Event.

The Issuer, having satisfied itself that a Special Event has occurred, shall

 notify the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of the occurrence of such Special Event.

8.3 Redemption at the option of the Issuer: The Issuer may, at its option (but subject to Condition 8.4 (Mandatory redemption deferral) and

(ii) the Notes have been exchanged for or converted

<<<

 into a Tier 1 Basic Own Funds item or another Tier 2 Basic Own Funds item of at least the same quality; and

<<<

 together with interest accrued to (but excluding) the date of redemption and any Arrears of Interest (together with all corresponding Additional Interest Amounts but excluding any interest that has been cancelled) upon the earliest of:

 8.4, 10 Business Days following the date on which the applicable conditions in Condition 8.8 (Conditions to redemption etc.) are fulfilled; and
(C) a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions in these Conditions

<<<

, the deferral of the redemption of the Notes in accordance with this Condition 8 will not constitute a default by the Issuer under the Notes or for any other purpose and will not give the Holders any right to accelerate the Notes such that

<<<

 amounts of principal, interest, Arrears of Interest or any corresponding Additional Interest Amounts would become due and payable on the Notes earlier than otherwise scheduled pursuant to these Conditions.
The Issuer shall give such prior notice

<<<

 to the Holders as is practicable in the circumstances in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices):

 Substitution, the Issuer has received the prior written consent of the Relevant Supervisory Authority.

Any such notice shall specify the relevant details of the manner in which the relevant Conditional Substitution shall take effect and, if

 or Coupon the Issuer shall indemnify such Holder against any loss sustained by such Holder as a result. In any event, the Issuer shall indemnify each such Holder against any cost of making such purchase which is reasonably incurred. These indemnities

<<<

 constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's other obligations, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder and shall continue in full

 relevant Holder and no proof or evidence of any actual loss will be required by the Issuer.
18. Waiver and Remedies
No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Holder, any right in these Conditions shall operate as

<<<

 a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. Rights hereunder shall be in addition to all other rights provided by law. No notice or demand

<<<

 given in any case shall constitute a waiver of rights to take other action in the same, similar or other instances without such notice or demand.

through a range of distribution channels, including the Danica Group

<<<

's own sales force and advisers, insurance brokers and the various outlets of Danske Bank.
In 2014, the Danica Group posted net profits of DKK 2.0 billion, an increase of 53 per cent. compared to 2013. With a capital base after cost of capital

<<<

 of DKK 17.5 billion, an excess capital base of DKK 10.4 billion and a collective bonus potential of DKK 2.5 billion, the Danica Group is a financially strong and well-capitalised insurance company. As of 30 June 2015, the capital base was DKK

<<<

 18.3 billion and the solvency requirement was DKK 10.9 billion, which gave a solvency ratio of 168 per cent.
The Issuer's share capital consists of 11,000,000 shares of a nominal value of DKK 100 each. All shares carry the same rights and,

<<<

 thus there is only one class of shares.
The Danica Group is wholly-owned by Danske Bank and effectively operates as the life and pensions division of the Danske Bank Group. Danske Bank is a market leading bank in Denmark and a Nordic universal

<<<

 bank.
The Issuer is primarily regulated by the Danish Financial Business Act (Consolidated Act No. 182 of 18 February 2015, as amended, regarding financial business (in Danish: "Lov om Finansiel Virksomhed") (the "Danish Financial Business

<<<

 Act") and overseen by the DFSA. The foreign subsidiaries are overseen by their respective national regulators.
The registered office of the Issuer is at 2-12 Holmens Kanal, DK-1092 Copenhagen and its business address is Parallelvej 17 DK-2

<<<

800 Kgs, Lyngby, Denmark. The Issuer's general telephone number is +45 70 11 25 25 and its Danish corporate registration number is 24 25 61 46.
The Issuer's History and Development
The Danica Group dates back to 1842, when the state company

<<<

 "Livrente- og Forsørgelses-Anstalten af 1842" was founded. In 1893, the company name was changed to "Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring". In 1990, the company was privatised and bought by the insurance group Baltica and the name of the company

<<<

 was changed to its present name. In 1995, the Danica Group was acquired by Danske Bank and, in 1999, the main part of the nonlife insurance business of the Danica Group was sold. Thereafter, the Danica Group has primarily been a life insurance

<<<

 and pension company. The Issuer was incorporated on 14 June 1990 in Denmark and is an insurance company with limited liability. The Issuer carries on business under the Danish Financial Business Act.
The Danica Group entered the Swedish market

<<<

 in 1998 and the Norwegian market in 2001. As at the date of this Prospectus, the activities in these two countries are organised into two subsidiaries, which are 100 per cent. owned by the Issuer.
Market
In Denmark, the life insurance sector

<<<

 is a combination of commercial life insurance companies, mutuals (non-profit companies) and labour market companies. The Issuer is a commercial company and is primarily competing against other commercial companies', mutuals' and the banking

<<<

 sector's sales of instalment pension schemes and retirement saving plans.
The Issuer is one of Denmark's largest life insurance companies, with a share of approximately 25 per cent. of the Danish life and pensions market in terms of premium

<<<

 income and assets (calculated excluding labour market insurance companies)2. The Issuer's market position is based on a wide supply of products and a diversified distribution model.
2 Calculated by the Issuer based on annual reports for competing

<<<

 life insurance companies. 57

Since 2010, pension payments in the Danish market have been flat as a result of a saturated market and regulations which have diminished savings incentives3. In 2010, the tax-deductible amount for contributions

<<<

 to
instalment pension schemes was reduced to DKK 100,000. The amount was reduced again in 2012 to DKK
50,000.

Price competition remains fierce, particularly with regard to health and accident insurance. For the health and accident insurance

<<<

 business, this has resulted in a non-profitable business segment, and this situation could continue for a longer period. Health and accident products are typically sold as an addition to more profitable pension savings products.

Strategy


<<<


The Danica Group operates as the life and pensions division of the Danske Bank Group and co-operates closely with other entities in the Danske Bank Group. There is a close managerial and operational integration within the Danske Bank Group

<<<

, and the Danica Group shares many of its back-office functions, including Information Technology, with the Danske Bank Group as well as a set of core values with the other entities in the Danske Bank Group.

Denmark

The Danica Group aims to

<<<

 remain one of the leading life and pension insurance groups in Denmark in terms of premium income and financial position, which includes being amongst the market leaders with respect to advice, investment return, product development, service

<<<

 and quality.

In 2014, approximately 67 per cent. of the Danica Group's sales were carried out by the Danica Group's own sales force, 22 per cent. were sold through branches of Danske Bank and the remainder was sold through other channels and

<<<

 brokers. The Danica Group aims to strengthen the collaboration with Danske Bank in relation to business customers as well as private customers.

The Danica Group's competitive position is based on its diversified distribution model, its co

<<<

-operation with the Danske Bank Group, efficient back-office systems, and innovative product designs, all of which helped the Danica Group to maintain its position in the Danish life and pensions market. The Danica Group continuously aims to

<<<

 improve its product offerings in order to be at the forefront of the developments in the market.

The Danica Group aims to provide high-quality customer service in terms of accessibility, short processing times and professional customer care

<<<

. Accordingly, the Issuer is currently the only Danish insurance company which has chosen to publish its processing times on an ongoing basis and to introduce daily penalties such that the Issuer will compensate its customers if it does not

<<<

 meet its obligations with respect to promised processing times.

Products

In the Danish market, the Danica Group provides a comprehensive range of insurance-based pension schemes, life insurance and health and accident products to employers

<<<

 and private individuals. These include both conventional policies based on a guaranteed return ("Danica Traditionel") and savings and unit-linked schemes in which the customers select the risk profiles themselves ("Danica Link"), life-cycle

<<<

 products ("Danica Balance") and products whereby the customers select the individual securities themselves ("Danica Select").



Danica Traditionel

Danica Traditionel is the Issuer's conventional pension product and dates back to the Issuer

<<<

's incorporation in 1842. Danica Traditionel is based on collective investments and does not require customers to make any decisions themselves as to how their money is invested.

3 Pension payments to both life insurance companies and banks

<<<

. Source: Forsikring og Pension (Danish Insurance Association). 58

As previously outlined, Danica Traditionel offers guaranteed benefits calculated on the basis of interest rates (technical rates) of 4.5 per cent., 2.5 per cent., 1.5 per cent

<<<

. or 0.5 per cent. New business is written on an interest rate of 0.5 per cent.

The guaranteed benefits apply to all future ordinary payments as well as current savings and guarantees under issued policies. The policies are divided into four

<<<

 interest rate groups based on the technical rates, and each group has its own investment strategy and asset allocation.

In practice, the Issuer announces annually to policyholders an interest rate on policyholders' savings. An interest rate

<<<

 higher than the relevant technical rate will typically increase the relevant policyholders' benefits. The interest rate paid to policyholders for the six months ended 30 June 2015 was 1.8 per cent. per annum before tax in all four interest

<<<

 rate groups. This has not changed compared to the year ended 31 December 2014.



Danica Link

Danica Link was launched in 2001. Danica Link is a unit-linked insurance product where savings can be invested in a number of unit trusts. Each customer

<<<

 has the opportunity to decide which unit trusts its savings are to be invested in, but it can also leave such investment decisions in the hands of the Issuer ("Danica Valg"), and only have to choose between five different risk profiles (i.e

<<<

. Low Risk, Medium Risk, High Risk, 100 per cent. Equities, 100 per cent. Bonds).

Danica Link has no guarantee attached to the savings, meaning that the financial risks related to the investments are borne by the policyholders. However, customers

<<<

 have the option to buy a guarantee from the Issuer, thereby insuring themselves against capital losses on their savings. Danica Link offers to guarantee customers' benefits equal to at least 95 per cent. of their contributions net of costs

<<<

. The benefits are adjusted annually. Due to legislation and risk spreading, asset allocation is subject to certain restrictions for customers who have chosen to buy a guarantee.



Danica Balance

Danica Balance was launched in 2005. Since

<<<

 then, it has become the Issuer's main savings product and the product that is recommended to most customers. Danica Balance is a life-cycle product, meaning that the asset allocation between different risk categories (i.e. bonds or equities

<<<

) for each customer is adjusted gradually as the customer gets older and approaches retirement age. Furthermore, the asset allocation for each customer depends on the customer's willingness to take risks. The Issuer manages the investments and

<<<

, consequently, the product combines the advantages of collective investments with individual adjustments of investments.

By default, Danica Balance is a savings product without a guarantee, but customers have the option to buy a guarantee

<<<

. The guarantee ensures a guaranteed minimum payment no matter how the investments perform during the guarantee period. The Issuer hedges the guarantee by means of adjusting the asset allocation.



Danica Select

Danica Select was launched

<<<

 in 2012. The product is similar to a custody account with a customer's own securities. Danica Select offers access to more than 15,000 securities on 17 stock exchanges in Europe and North America. As the investment decisions are taken by the

<<<

 customers, it is not possible to attach a guarantee to Danica Select and consequently, the financial risks related to the investments are borne by the customers.

59



Risk products

The Danica Group has a number of risk products in its portfolio

<<<

. Health insurance, loss of earning capacity, critical illness and private treatment facilities are the non-life products which are offered. The products are separated from the pension products with respect to both accounting and investment

<<<

 strategy.

In 2014, more than 87 per cent. of new premiums were written in unit-linked products (Danica Balance, Danica Link and Danica Select), 7 per cent. in health & accident products and 6 per cent. in Danica Traditionel.

In recent years

<<<

, groups of customers have been offered the possibility of switching from their Danica Traditionel product to Danica Balance. Compensation has been paid to the customers for forfeiting their existing guarantees. In the first 6 months of 201

<<<

5, this has led to internal transfers of about DKK 2.6 billion including compensation. The campaign is in line with an agreement entered into between the Danish pension industry and the Danish Minister for Business and Growth to facilitate customers

<<<

' moves from guaranteed pension products to unit-linked products, which are more in line with current market trends and which are expected to offer customers higher returns over time. The campaign will continue in the second half of 2015 and

<<<

 is also expected to continue in 2016.

Until the end of 2015, customers have the option of converting their capital pension schemes to retirement savings plans, and thereby receive a tax rebate.

Digitalization

Digital advisory tools are becoming

<<<

 an increasingly important point of contact with customers. Customers are demanding qualitative online advisory tools, and the proportion of customers opting to use online tools is growing rapidly.

In 2013, the Danica Group introduced the advisory

<<<

 tool "Danica Pension Check". On the basis of information about their insurance policies and pension schemes with the Danica Group and other companies, customers can use this online tool to determine whether they have the appropriate savings

<<<

 and insurance coverage by answering six simple questions. To date, more than 35,000 customers have used the Danica Pension Check, and more than 40 per cent. of these customers do not have coverage that matches the Danica Group's recommendations

<<<

. Based on the Danica Pension Check, two-thirds of these customers choose to follow the recommendations and adjust their pension schemes to fit their needs and almost 80 per cent. get better coverage without having to make any additional contributions

<<<

 to their pension schemes.

Towards the end of 2013, the Danica Group launched "Danica Health Check", a new electronic preventive tool for customers. In collaboration with several corporate customers, the Danica Group has conducted campaigns

<<<

 in which the Danica Group provided this online health check as one of several offers to the corporate customers' employees. More than 12,000 customers have completed online health checks. Such initiatives are very well received by the companies

<<<

' employees, and the rate of participation is generally very high.

In the spring of 2014, the Danica Group launched an online tool for new employees at corporate customers. By answering a few questions, customers can use this tool to activate

<<<

 their insurance and pension savings and get the right coverage immediately. The Danica Group contacts customers if they require special adaptation of their pension schemes. Customers are free to choose how they wish to communicate with the

<<<

 Danica Group ­ by phone, online meeting, email or by meeting an advisor face to face.

International activities

In Norway and Sweden, the Issuer's two subsidiaries offer unit-linked products and health and accident insurance to employers as

<<<

 well as to private individuals. Products are distributed via the subsidiary's own sales force, Danske Bank and brokers, and in Norway also as co-branded products.

60

In 2014, market share was 5 per cent. in Norway in terms of unit-linked

<<<

 premiums and 3 per cent. in Sweden in terms of total premiums4.

Both subsidiaries pursue a growth strategy based on a stronger co-operation with Danske Bank A/S, exploitation of other strategic alliances and a strong focus on profitability

<<<

 and customer satisfaction.

The Danica Group aims to strengthen the co-operation across borders between the companies in the Danica Group in order to improve the pension schemes offered to companies with business activities across the Nordic

<<<

 countries.

The Danica Group's international solutions also include multinational pooling, which allows multinational companies to benefit from gathering the employee benefit plans across borders. The Danica Group is working together with three

<<<

 multinational pooling networks: Insurope, Swiss Life and Allianz Global Benefits.

Investment

The Danica Group manages the current challenging low-yield environment through a combination of strict liability hedging and an investment process

<<<

 that ensures high risk-adjusted returns. The investment strategy for Danica Traditionel is divided into two steps.

Firstly, the guaranteed pensions are divided into four different interest rate groups according to their average technical interest

<<<

 rates, and the interest rate sensitivity of each interest group is then hedged separately. The Danica Group uses a combination of bonds and interest derivatives to construct the hedges. The actual hedges are managed actively with the aim of

<<<

 obtaining the cheapest possible hedges as well as enhancing the return of the hedges.

Secondly, an investment portfolio is constructed to deliver high risk adjusted returns and at the same time to be robust in different economic environments

<<<

. For each of the four interest rate groups, the exposure to the portfolio is determined based on the size of the buffers and the Danica Group's risk appetite.

In order to get the highest possible risk-adjusted returns combined with robustness

<<<

 in the returns, the Danica Group has divided the investment portfolio into three parts.



The first part consists of alternative investments as they give a relatively high running yield with an

acceptable risk, and at the same time, contribute

<<<

 with attractive portfolio characteristics such as inflation

protection and diversification. In the current low-yield environment, the Danica Group has a particular

focus on alternative investments with bond-like characteristics and high illiquidity

<<<

 premia, as these offer a

high yield relative to the risk and, in many cases, also a high level of protection against inflation.

Currently the Danica Group also takes advantage of the reduced attractiveness for banks to fund

subordinated

<<<

 debt to companies due to new regulations. The Danica Group has unique access to such

direct investments through its position in the Danske Bank Group.



The second part of the investments are the classic listed asset classes such as equity

<<<

, fixed income etc.

which give exposure to the overall market risk at limited investment costs and with generally high

liquidity. The Danica Group invests in a number of externally actively managed portfolios, as well as in

passively managed

<<<

 index portfolios.



Finally, overlay strategies in liquid derivatives are used for tactical asset allocation to harvest risk premia

or to adjust the overall portfolio properties in order to get the desired characteristics such as protection

<<<



against rising rates or inflation, ensuring adequate liquidity in market turmoil.

In 2014, the overall return on customer funds in Danica Traditionel before tax on pension returns was 14.0 per cent. The overall return after strengthening

<<<

 of technical provisions due to a lower interest rate level was

4 Source: Norwegian Branch Statistic (www.fno.no) and Insurance Sweden Branch Statistic. 61

7.2 per cent. In the first half of 2015, the return was - 0.3 per cent. before tax

<<<

 on pension returns and 3.0 per cent. following the recognition of lower life insurance provisions due to a higher interest rate level. The table below specifies the return before tax on pension returns in the first half of 2015 and in 2014

Until year-end

<<<

 2015, the investments of Danish life insurance companies are subject to certain restrictions regarding asset allocation. The Issuer complies with these restrictions. From 1 January 2016, the restrictions will be replaced by the prudent-person

<<<

 principle, which implies that Danish life insurance companies are required to invest their assets so that the interests of the insurance company's policyholders and beneficiaries are safeguarded as best as possible. The Issuer's current investment

<<<

 strategy complies with the prudent-person principle.

Reports for first half of 2015 and the Issuer's Report and supplementary/corrective information on the annual report for 2014

In 2014, the Danica Group

<<<

 realised a profit before tax of DKK 2,611 million, against DKK 1,433 million in 2013. The improvement was primarily due to the Issuer's ability to book net DKK 610 million from the shadow account, i.e. the risk allowance from previous years

<<<

 that the Issuer had not yet been able to book due to low bonus potential. By comparison, there was a net transfer of DKK 438 million to the shadow account in 2013.

In general, the Danica Group's technical result (i.e. before transfers to and

<<<

 from the shadow account, changes in realised returns on investments, and changes in special allotments) tends to be more stable than profits before tax. As outlined in the table above, in 2011 Technical result, Traditionel was negatively affected

<<<

 by approximately DKK 0.5 billion due to a change in profits related to provisions in a company pension scheme. For additional information, see the Issuer's supplementary report which is incorporated by reference into this Prospectus.

In the

<<<

 first 6 months of 2015, the Danica Group booked a technical result of DKK 891 million and a profit before tax of 1,140 million. Profit before tax for the Issuer was DKK 1,088 million.

Danica Traditionel contributed 16 per cent. of the Danica Group's total premiums in 2014 (13 per cent. in the first half of 2015). By comparison, Danica Traditionel contributed 31 per cent. in 2010. The migration away from Danica

Solvency II will come into effect from 1 January 2016. The Danica Group has closely monitored the work on the Solvency II rules, and is well-prepared

<<<

 for the new rules.

As a precursor to the coming Solvency II rules, in 2007 the DFSA introduced a requirement for insurance companies to calculate their solvency need. The solvency need is a risk-based capital requirement, calculated according

<<<

 to the company's own risk assessment, to complement the solvency requirement. All Danish insurance companies are required to maintain a capital base corresponding at least to the higher of the solvency requirement and the solvency need.

As

<<<

 of 1 January 2014, the DFSA implemented a solvency regime very close to the coming Solvency II rules. The pre-implementation of a risk-based approach to the solvency capital requirement ("SCR" rules) calculation has effectively meant that the

<<<

 Issuer is already close to being fully Solvency II compliant. Furthermore, the DFSA introduced a quarterly reporting requirement as from the first quarter of 2014, based on the coming Solvency II schedules, albeit in reduced form, and on the

<<<

 calculation of the solvency need.

The Danica Group is confident that it will be Solvency II compliant in accordance with the Solvency II regulations as of 1 January 2016. The Danica Group can to some extent adjust its capital requirement via

<<<

 its asset allocation and hedging strategy, and consequently it is expected that the excess capital base after 1 January 2016 will be more or less on par with the current level. Based on the actual asset allocation and hedging in the first half

<<<

 of 2015, calculations have shown that the excess capital base based on Solvency II fluctuates around the current level of excess capital base.

The solvency ratio for the Danica Group after Solvency II will be calculated on the basis of standard

<<<

 models but with longevity rates based on sector specific rates.

When calculating the SCR from 1 January 2016, the Issuer intends not to use either the transitional measure on the risk-free interest rates or the transitional measure on technical

<<<

 provisions. The Issuer instead intends to use the transitional measure for standard equity risk stating that type 1 equities purchased on or before 1 January 2016 will be applied a reduced stress of 22 per cent. in 2016 (instead of 39 per cent

<<<

.). The stress will increase linearly towards the 39 per cent. over a period of 7 years.

The Danica Group supervises capital requirements on a daily basis. The majority of the capital requirements are related to Danica Traditionel.

65

Based

<<<

 on Solvency II requirements enacted in Danish law as at 1 January 2016 the best estimate (pro forma) of the fully loaded Solvency II ratio of the Issuer as of the first half 2015 is within the range of 160 ­ 170 per cent. In any case, the Issuer

<<<

 will aim for the Solvency II ratio to be managed above a minimum level of 150 per cent.

Special allotments

Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring, which was privatised in 1990, is today part of the Issuer. Under the terms of the privatisation

<<<

, the legitimate bonus expectations of the customers of Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring also had to be honoured after the privatisation. Thus, the Issuer has an obligation to allocate part of the margin by which the equity exceeds the capital

<<<

 requirement to certain policyholders who were previously policyholders of Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring. This applies if the margin exceeds the margin in Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring before the privatisation in 1990 or if dividend

<<<

 payments reduce the margin. Paid-up capital and interest thereon may, however, be distributed to shareholders without compensation to previous policyholders of Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring.

Special allotments for a given year will be

<<<

 correlated with the proportion of provisions related to policies from the former Statsansanstalten for Livsforsikring compared to total provisions in the Danica Pension Group.

The obligation to allot an additional amount will apply as long

<<<

 as there are still current policies from Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring in the Issuer and can have a significant negative impact on the Issuer's financial results and the Issuer's ability to pay dividends.

Dividend policy

Due to an agreement

<<<

 between the insurance and pension industry and the Danish Ministry of Business and Growth, the Issuer is only allowed to distribute dividends until 1 January 2016 if its solvency exceeds the minimum requirement by 175 per cent. After 1 January

<<<

 2016, the agreement does not restrict dividend payments from the Issuer (such lack of restriction also applies to the proposed dividend in the annual report for 2015). However, after 1 January 2016, dividend payments will still be restricted

<<<

 by (i) the Issuer's capital requirements and (ii) an intention to have a capital base in the Issuer in excess of the required capital base.

Dividend payments from the Issuer are limited to the Issuer's free reserves. As of year-end 2014, this

<<<

 corresponded to the Issuer's retained earnings of DKK 15.5 billion.

Risk Management

The Board of Directors is in charge of the overall management of the company and generally holds six meetings a year. Limits related to risk and investments

<<<

 are approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is closely involved in management of strategic risk, and business initiatives are carefully analyzed and monitored before they are implemented.

The Board of Directors has set up

<<<

 an Audit Committee to prepare the work of the Board of Directors on financial reporting and audit matters, including related risk matters, which either the Board of Directors, the committee itself, the external auditors or the head of Internal

<<<

 Audit may choose to review further. The Committee works on the basis of clearly defined terms of reference. The Committee is not authorised to make independent decisions, but instead reports exclusively to the Board of Directors. In 2014, the

<<<

 Audit Committee held six meetings.

The Issuer's Executive Board is in charge of the day-to-day management, including risk management, and has established three committees to manage risk, investment and valuation:



The Risk Committee chaired

<<<

 by the chief risk officer. The chief financial officer and the chief investment

officer (both of whom are also members of the Executive Board), the chief actuarial officer and the head

of Finance are members. Danske Bank's chief risk officer

<<<

 is present at the regular meetings. Based on

limits approved by the Board of Directors, the Committee has responsibility for the asset-liability

66

management, solvency requirement and hedging strategies. The Committee has four to six general

<<<

 meetings, but meets more frequently in times of volatile financial markets.



The Investment Committee is chaired by the chief investment officer. The Danica Group's chief financial

officer is a member of the Committee. The Committee has

<<<

 weekly meetings to discuss the developments

in the financial markets, risk reporting and asset allocation.



The Valuation Committee is chaired by the chief financial officer. The chief investment officer, the chief

risk officer and the

<<<

 head of Finance are members. The Committee has quarterly meetings regarding the

validation of valuations of alternative investments.

Insurance risks are monitored by the actuarial department which also analyses and implements the underwriting

<<<

, acceptance and reinsurance.

On a daily basis the Issuer's Risk Department ensures that limits approved by the Board of Directors are adhered to and that the capital requirements are met.

Financial reports are prepared every month and sent

<<<

 to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors. Every year, the Board of Directors approves a budget and business plan for the coming year as well as a capital plan and a capital contingency plan.

Operational risk

The Issuer's operational

<<<

 risk policy covers the following activities:



Identification, monitoring and management of current and potential operational risk exposure.



Handling of "critical risks", that is, risks that require follow-up and further reporting.



Reporting

<<<

 to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the assessment and management of

operational risks.

The Issuer has other policies, including Information Technology security policy, that also support operational risk management. Once

<<<

 a year the Issuer does a risk identification study and prepares an inventory of the main operational risks. All areas of the Issuer are covered by this study, and there is set risk ownership of each risk. In relation to these risks, the current

<<<

 mitigation plans are assessed and found adequate. There is not currently planned further initiatives.

The Issuer has established a reporting structure to continuously monitor the identified operational risks and associated losses. Identified

<<<

 operational losses exceeding DKK 10,000 are continuously recorded in an Operational Risk Information System.

Regulatory overview

Overview of recent relevant European Union Legislation

On 1 January 2016, the EU Solvency II framework ("Solvency

<<<

 II") regulating insurance companies will come into force. Solvency II reviews the prudential regime for insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the European Union. The Solvency II Directive (Directive 2009/138/EC) was adopted in November

<<<

 2009, and amended by Directive 2014/51/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council in April 2014 (the so-called "Omnibus II Directive"). Solvency II was implemented into Danish legislation by Act No. 308 of 28 March 2015 amending the Danish

<<<

 Financial Business Act, which will enter into force on 1 January 2016. Consequently, the coming legislation is known in general terms, but the full impact of the implementation of Solvency II into Danish law is yet to be seen. In October 2

<<<

014, the European Commission adopted the Delegated Regulation (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35) containing implementing rules for Solvency II. In March 2015, the European Commission adopted the first set of Solvency II Implementing Regulations

<<<

 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to the supervisory approval procedures for undertaking-specific parameters, ancillary own
67

funds, matching adjustment, special purpose vehicles, internal models, and joint decision

<<<

 on group internal models.
General Principles of Regulation
The Issuer operates primarily through an insurance company domiciled in Denmark. The Issuer's insurance business is authorised by the DFSA.
The basic regulatory power of the DFSA is

<<<

 based on the home state control principle.
Pursuant to the Danish Financial Business Act, it is the DFSA that grants regulatory permission to companies to provide insurance for one or more classes recognised by the EU insurance directives.

<<<

 An insurance company may not engage in activities other than insurance operations and related activities, unless specifically permitted to do so by the insurance regulation or authorised by the relevant FSA. Danish insurance companies are required

<<<

 to report their annual accounts to the DFSA. They are also required to submit detailed annual financial reports and key figures for their insurance operations to the DFSA. In addition, external and internal auditors' long-form audit reports

<<<

 relating to the annual accounts must be filed with the DFSA. The DFSA is also entitled to ask for any additional information from the supervisory board, group management, internal auditors and external auditors and the appointed actuary. From

<<<

 time to time, the DFSA will conduct a thorough on-site inspection of each insurance company. The DFSA may review other issues such as IT security, reinsurance adequacy and asset valuation at any time between the general inspections. The statements

<<<

 of the DFSA's inspections are published on Danske Bank's website (http://danskebank.com/en-uk/ir/Regulation/Pages/The-Danish-FSA.aspx).
Danish insurance companies are required, pursuant to the Danish Financial Business Act, to employ an appointed

<<<

 actuary to carry out necessary actuarial functions, including calculation of life provisions. The actuary cannot also be a member of the Executive Board and/or the Board of Directors. One of the key responsibilities of the actuary is to ensure

<<<

 that the life insurance company is in compliance with its technical basis.
In order to protect policyholders, the Danish Financial Business Act requires that the value of the assets of an insurance company corresponds, at a minimum, to the

<<<

 value of a company's total technical provisions and prepaid insurance premiums. The insurance company shall, in accordance with the Danish Financial Business Act, keep a register of such assets. The assets in such register shall be exclusively

<<<

 used for the satisfaction of the policyholders and not the general creditors of the insurance company. Policyholders have a right of priority to these assets in the event of an insurance company's insolvency.
The basic regulatory powers of

<<<

 the Swedish and Norwegian regulators are based on the home state control principle. The regulatory permission to provide insurance is in general similar to that in Denmark.
Swedish and Norwegian insurance companies are required to employ an

<<<

 appointed actuary to carry out necessary actuarial functions, including calculations and investigations. One of the key responsibilities of the actuary is to ensure that the life insurance company is in compliance with its technical basis.

<<<


Concession
All insurance companies, whether life or non-life, in the jurisdictions in which the companies operate must be licensed by the relevant financial services authority in order to carry out insurance operations, which in Denmark is

<<<

 the DFSA. The Issuer has obtained the relevant licences relating to the insurance activities conducted by the Issuer and its subsidiaries.
Ownership
Acquisitions in Denmark of more than 10 per cent., 20 per cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per cent

<<<

. of the shares or voting rights of an insurance company, including an insurance holding company, must each be reported to, and are subject to, pre-approval from the DFSA. DFSA approval is based on the filing of a statutory information questionnaire

<<<

 by the acquirer allowing the DFSA to determine whether or not such acquirer meets the criteria set
68

out in the Danish Financial Business Act. The DFSA is required to approve an acquisition unless the acquisition endangers the proper and

<<<

 sound management of a financial services company or a financial holding company.
Policyholders' Right of Priority to Certain Assets
In order to protect policyholders, the Danish Financial Business Act requires that the value of the assets of

<<<

 an insurance company corresponds, at a minimum, to the value of a company's total technical provisions and prepaid insurance premiums. The insurance company shall, in accordance with the Danish Financial Business Act, keep a register of such

<<<

 assets. The assets in such register shall be exclusively used for the satisfaction of the policyholders and not the general creditors of the insurance company. Policyholders have a right of priority to these assets in the event of an insurance

<<<

 company's insolvency.
Confidentiality
The Danish Financial Business Act requires that members of the supervisory board and employees of insurance companies and other financial services companies are subject to confidentiality in relation to

<<<

 all information received in the course of their business. With certain exceptions, the confidentiality requirements also apply to the exchange of information regarding the policyholders between the Issuer and its subsidiaries.
The Danish data

<<<

 protection rules (Act no. 429 of 31 May 2000, as amended) regarding personal data, (in Danish: "Persondataloven") also require confidentiality in relation to the treatment and disclosure of confidential information concerning policyholders

<<<

.
Good Practice
The Danish Financial Business Act includes a number of provisions that apply to all financial services companies, including insurance companies. These provisions require that financial services companies shall be operated in

<<<

 accordance with honest and fair business practice and "good practice" within the financial industry. Effective as of 1 January 2005, the Danish Financial Business Act authorised the DFSA to publish the name of any financial services company

<<<

 ordered by the DFSA to rectify a particular matter.
In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the Danica Group's policyholders can complain about the Issuer and its subsidiaries to a special insurance appeal board if they are not satisfied with the treatment

<<<

 they receive. The Issuer is not currently involved in any complaints with the insurance appeal boards which can impact its business materially.
Internal Audit
Danish insurance companies of a certain size must have an internal audit function

<<<

. The head of the internal audit function is to be employed by and report directly to the supervisory board. The Issuer has an internal auditor.
Amalgamation and Transfer of Insurance Portfolios
In Denmark, the amalgamation of two financial

<<<

 services companies is subject to prior approval by the DFSA. If an insurance company transfers all or part of its insurance portfolio in connection with an approved amalgamation, it is discharged from its insurance liabilities. If the transfer

<<<

 is by way of an amalgamation between insurance companies, policyholders cannot rely on the amalgamation as a basis for terminating the insurance agreement. The transfer of an insurance portfolio from one insurance company to another is also

<<<

 subject to approval by the DFSA.
Compliance with Financial Regulation
The Issuer and the Danica Group are in compliance with all material rules regulating their businesses.
69

Management
Pursuant to DFSA regulations, new members of the Boards

<<<

 of Directors and the Executive Board of the Issuer are required to submit a Fit & Proper reporting form to the DFSA prior to their appointment to determine whether or not they have adequate experience and are fit and proper to be involved in

<<<

 or caused to be communicated, and will only communicate or cause to be communicated, any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by

(b) General compliance

<<<

: it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

TAXATION
The following is a general description of relevant tax considerations and is not to be regarded

<<<

 as a complete tax analysis of all tax issues related to the Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes should consult their professional tax advisers if they are in doubt about their own tax position.
Denmark Taxation
The following is a summary

<<<

 description of the taxation in Denmark of the Notes according to the Danish tax laws in force as of the date of this Prospectus and is subject to any changes in law and the interpretation and application thereof, which changes could be made

<<<

 with retroactive effect. The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, hold or dispose of the Notes, and does not purport to deal with the

<<<

 tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as professional dealers in securities) may be subject to special rules. Potential investors are under all circumstances strongly recommended to contact their own

<<<

 tax advisor to clarify the individual consequences of their investment, holding and disposal of the Notes. The Issuer makes no representation regarding the tax consequences of purchase, holding or disposal of the Notes.
Taxation at source
Under

<<<

 existing Danish tax laws, no general withholding tax or coupon tax will apply to payment of interest or principal amounts due on the Notes, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred

<<<

 to in the Danish Corporation Tax Act (in Danish: "Selskabsskatteloven"), Consolidated Act No. 680 of 20 May 2015, as amended from time to time. This will not have any impact on holders of the Notes who are not in a relationship whereby they

<<<

 control, or are controlled by, the Issuer, or where the holder of the Notes and the Issuer are not controlled by the same group of shareholders.
Resident Holders of Notes
Private individuals, including persons who are engaged in financial trade

<<<

, companies and similar enterprises resident in Denmark for tax purposes or receiving interest on the Notes through their permanent establishment(s) in Denmark are liable to pay tax on such interest.
Capital gains are taxable to individuals

<<<

 and corporate entities in accordance with the Danish Capital and Exchange Gains Act (in Danish: "Kursgevinstloven"), Consolidated Act No. 1113 of 18 September 2013, as amended from time to time. Gains and losses on Notes held by corporate entities

<<<

 are generally taxed in accordance with a mark-to-market principle (in Danish: "lagerprincippet"), i.e. on an unrealised basis.
Gains and losses on Notes issued to individuals are generally taxed on a realised basis. The net gains are taxed

<<<

 as capital income at a rate of up to 42 per cent in 2015. However, this tax rate does not apply if the individual is engaged in financial trade and considered a professional trader. The gains and losses will only be included in the taxable

<<<

 income when the net gain or loss for the year on all debt claims, debt denominated in foreign currency and investment certificates in bond-based investment funds subject to the minimum taxation, exceeds a total of DKK 2,000.
A variety of features

<<<

 regarding interest and principal may apply to the Notes. The applicable taxation of capital gains to corporate entities or individuals will depend on the features applicable to the Notes in question.
Non-Resident Holders of Notes
Under existing

<<<

 Danish tax laws, payments of interest or principal amounts to any for tax purposes nonresident holder of the Notes are not subject to taxation in Denmark, other than in certain cases on payment in respect of controlled debt in relation to the

<<<

 Issuer as referred to under "Taxation at source" above. Thus no withholding tax should be payable with respect to such payments. Any capital gains realised upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note will not be subject to taxation in Denmark

<<<

, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to under "Taxation at source" above.
74

This tax treatment applies solely to holders of the Notes who are not subject to full tax

<<<

 liability in Denmark or included in a Danish joint taxation scheme or do not carry on business in Denmark through a permanent establishment.
EU Savings Directive
Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form

<<<

 of interest payments (the "Savings Directive"), EU Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of other EU Member States details of certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in an

<<<

 EU Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another EU Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another EU Member State.
For a transitional period, Austria is instead required (unless during that

<<<

 period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (subject to a procedure whereby, on meeting certain conditions, the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that no tax be withheld

<<<

). The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted

<<<

 similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive (the "Amending Directive") amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above

<<<

. The Amending Directive requires EU Member States to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017 and if they were to take effect the changes would expand the range of payments covered by the Savings Directive, in particular to include

<<<

 additional types of income payable on securities. They would also expand the circumstances in which payments must be reported or subject to withholding. This approach would apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal

<<<

 arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the EU.
However, the European Commission has proposed

<<<

 the repeal of the Savings Directive from 1 January 2017 in the case of Austria and from 1 January 2016 in the case of all other EU Member States (subject to ongoing requirements to fulfil administrative obligations such as the reporting and

<<<

 exchange of information relating to, and accounting for withholding taxes on, payments made before those dates). This is to prevent overlap between the Savings Directive and a new automatic exchange of information regime to be implemented under

<<<

 Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU). The new regime under Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is in accordance with the Global Standard released

<<<

 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in July 2014. Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is generally broader in scope than the Savings Directive, although it does not impose withholding taxes. The proposal also

<<<

 provides that, if it proceeds, EU Member States will not be required to apply the new requirements of the Amending Directive.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA")

<<<

 impose a new reporting regime and potentially a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to certain payments to any non-U.S. financial institution (a "foreign financial institution", or "FFI" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a 

<<<

"Participating FFI" by entering into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to provide the IRS with certain information in respect of its account holders and investors or is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance

<<<

 with FATCA. The Issuer is classified as an FFI.
The new withholding regime is now in effect for payments from sources within the United States and will apply to "foreign passthru payments" (a term not yet defined) no earlier than 1 January

<<<

 2017. This withholding would potentially apply to payments in respect of (i) any Notes characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterized as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued after the

<<<

 "grandfathering date", which is the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are filed with the Federal Register, or which are materially modified after the grandfathering

<<<

 date and (ii) any Notes characterised as equity or which do not have a fixed term
75

for U.S. federal tax purposes, whenever issued. If the Notes are characterised as debt for U.S. federal tax purposes they should not be subject to withholding

<<<

 under FATCA unless materially modified after the grandfathering date.
The United States and a number of other jurisdictions have entered into intergovernmental agreements to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (each, an "IGA"). Pursuant

<<<

 to FATCA and the "Model 1" and "Model 2" IGAs released by the United States, an FFI in an IGA signatory country could be treated as a "Reporting FI" not subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives. Further, an FFI in an IGA

<<<

 jurisdiction generally would not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) (any such withholding being "FATCA Withholding") from payments it makes. Under each Model IGA, a Reporting FI would still be required

<<<

 to report certain information in respect of its account holders and investors to its home government or to the IRS. The United States and Denmark have entered into an agreement (the "United StatesDenmark IGA") based largely on the Model 1 IGA

<<<

.
If the Issuer is treated as a Reporting FI pursuant to the United States-Denmark IGA it does not anticipate that it will be obliged to deduct any FATCA Withholding on payments it makes. There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will

<<<

 be treated as a Reporting FI, or that it would in the future not be required to deduct FATCA Withholding from payments it makes. Accordingly, the Issuer and financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made may be required

<<<

 to withhold FATCA Withholding if (i) any FFI through or to which payment on such Notes is made is not a Participating FFI, a Reporting FI, or otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA.
Whilst the Notes are in global form and

<<<

 held within the ICSDs, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Notes by the Issuer, any Paying Agent and the common depositary given that each of the entities in the payment chain

<<<

 between the Issuer and the participants in the ICSDs is a major financial institution whose business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Notes. The documentation

<<<

 expressly contemplates the possibility that the Notes may go into definitive form and therefore that they may be taken out of the ICSDs. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. However

<<<

, Definitive Notes will only be printed in remote circumstances.
FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all of which

<<<

 are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to payments they may receive in connection with the Notes.
The

<<<

 proposed financial transactions tax (the "FTT")
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria

<<<

, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States").
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances

<<<

. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt.
Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply

<<<

 to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating

<<<

 Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member

<<<

 State.
Joint statements issued by participating Member States indicate an intention to implement the FTT by 1 January 2016.
76

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and the scope

<<<

 of any such tax is uncertain. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
