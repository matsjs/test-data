1 035463.2 - FRN Sea Production Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012

Oslo, 14 February 2014

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

1.

INTRODUCTION

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders

<<<

") of the USD 130,000,000 FRN Sea Production Limited Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Sea Production Ltd (the "Company"). The terms and conditions of the Bonds are set out in the bond agreement

<<<

 dated 9 February 2007 between the Company and the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) as amended on 23 July 2010 and 23 August 2010, and as amended and restated on 21 March 2012 and 2 July 2012 (the "Bond Agreement").

All capitalised

<<<

 terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement or this summons (the "Summons") unless otherwise stated.

The information in this Summons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status o f the Company is

<<<

 provided by the Company, and the Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its entirety.

2.

BACKGROUND

The current Maturity Date o f the Loan is

<<<

 14 February 2014 and the Borrower does not currently have sufficient funds available to it to repay the Loan in full on the current Maturity Date.

The Borrower is therefore in discussions with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the

<<<

 "Committee") holding in excess of 66 2/3% of the principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, in relation to a possible restructuring of the terms of the Loan including an extension of the Maturity Date.

The Borrower is requesting a short extension

<<<

 to the maturity date of the Bonds to 14 March 2014 to allow these discussions to continue.

The Borrower therefore seeks an extension of the maturity date to 14 March 2014, with the other terms of the Bond Agreement remaining unchanged, save

<<<

 for amendments to the definition of "Maturity Date". The Committee has indicated that its support for an extension of the Maturity Date to 14 March 2014 would be conditional upon the Borrower meeting its interest payment obligations on 14 February

<<<

 2014.

THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

Based on the foregoing

<<<

, the Borrower is seeking approval for the following amendments to the Bond Agreement:

The proposed deferral under the Bond Agreement

It is proposed that conditional upon the interest due on the Bonds being paid in full on the Interest Payment

<<<

 Date on 14 February 2014, the Maturity Date of the Loan (currently 14 February 2014) shall be deferred until 14 March 2014.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall still be required to pay to the Bondholders in full the interest that

<<<

 is due on the Loan on the Interest Payment Date of 14 February 2014.

4.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSALS

The B orrow er's evaluation:

The Company believes that the proposal is the best interim solution for all stakeholders including the Bondholders

<<<

 in view of the Company's current financial situation.

The Bond Trustee has received written undertakings from the members of the Committee, confirming that they will vote in favour of the proposal at the Bondholders' Meeting. The Bond Trustee

<<<

 therefore intends to enter into an amendment agreement to effect the extension to maturity prior to the date of the Bondholders' Meeting. If the Bond Trustee does enter into the amendment agreement prior to the date of the Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

, the Bondholders will be asked to ratify this act.

Non-reliance of the Bond Trustee:

The proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee or the Committee. The Bondholders must

<<<

 independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal and financial advisers regarding the effect of the proposals.
