1. BACKGROUND
In 2017, we, Solteq Oyj, redefined our strategy to position ourselves as a Nordic industry-independent IT provider and software house

<<<

 that specializes in digital business solutions. According to our updated strategy, we serve those industries whose traditional operating models are being shaken by the digital revolution and want to simplify the digital world to make a better

<<<

 tomorrow.
As a key action, to drive our strategy, we develop our own software products and services and are especially active in areas that enable us to incorporate robotics and artificial intelligence into our products and services.
Such business

<<<

 development activities by Solteq Oyj are eligible for funding for research and product development activities (development loans) provided by Business Finland (the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, formerly Tekes) or, as the case may be

<<<

, also by equivalent international organisations and/or undertakings.
In accordance with the Government Decree on Funding for Research, Development and Innovation Activities (1444/2014, Fi: Valtioneuvoston asetus tutkimus-, kehittamis- ja innovaatiotoiminnan

<<<

 rahoituksesta), Business Finland may grant loans covering up to 50% of a project's total costs. The loans by Business Finland are unsecured, with an annual interest rate of three (3) percentage points below the base interest rate, or at least

<<<

 one percent. The loan period is typically seven or ten years, of which three or five years can be amortization-free. Pursuant to the Decree and in accordance with the relevant Business Finland decision, if the relevant development project fails

<<<

 or its results cannot be used in business operations, the unpaid principal and interests can be converted partially into a grant.
Now, Solteq Oyj has a possibility to funding by Business Finland. We estimate the aggregate maximum amount of

<<<

 the research and development loans to amount to EUR 3,000,000. The payback of such potential loans is estimated to start in 2021 the earliest.
As the research and development funding provided by Business Finland and equivalent international

<<<

 organisations and/or undertakings is advantageous compared to other debt financing available to us, we request that the Terms and Conditions are amended to include loans by Business Finland and/or equivalent international organisations and

<<<

/or undertakings as "Permitted D eb t"defined in Section 1.1 "Definitions''"of the Terms and Conditions (the "Amendment").
The Issuer has requested the Agent to choose a Written Procedure under which the Noteholders shall vote for the Request

<<<

 and provide the Noteholders with necessary instructions in respect of the procedure.

5.3 Voting rights and authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date of 13 July 2018 be registered on a securities account with the CSD, as a direct registered owner (Fin. omistaja) or nominee

<<<

 (Fin. hallintarekisteroinnin hoitaja) with respect to one or several Notes.
5.4 Notes registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Notes are held through a registered nominee or another intermediary

, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Notes.
(i) You can ask the nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you
(ii) You can obtain a Power of Attorney

<<<

 (Schedule 2) from the nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Notes through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is

<<<

 registered in the CSD as Noteholder, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the CSD as a Noteholder as nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options

<<<

 are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact

<<<

 the securities firm that holds the Notes on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Notes are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate.

<<<

-six and two thirds (66 2/3) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Noteholders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to the Request.
