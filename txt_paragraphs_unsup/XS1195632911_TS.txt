 Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled. Subject as provided herein, the Issuer may also, at its option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes at any time during the relevant redemption

<<<

(Redemption and Purchase) in "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes".
If at any time the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group has fallen below 7.125 per cent., the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amounts shall be reduced. Following any such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts, the Issuer may, at its discretion, reinstate some or all of the principal amount of the Notes, if certain conditions are met. See Condition

<<<

In particular, in August

<<<

 not give rise to a contravention of the TMR Rules by any person and/or (ii) in relation to any sale of or offer to sell Notes to a retail client in any EEA member state other than the United Kingdom, where (a) it has conducted an assessment

<<<

RISK FACTORS
Prospective investors should read the entire Prospectus and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
The Issuer

<<<

 believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. All of these factors are contingencies that may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o

<<<

 f any such contingency occurring.
Factors which the Issuer believes may be material for the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are also described below.
The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent

<<<

 the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer

<<<

 based on information currently available to it and which it may not currently be able to anticipate.
The following is a general discussion o f certain risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes

<<<

. In particular, it does not consider an investor's specific knowledge and/or understanding about risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes, whether obtained through experience, training or otherwise

<<<

, or the lack o f such specific knowledge and/or understanding, or circumstances that may apply to a particular investor.
Words and expressions defined in the "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes " below or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the

<<<

 same meanings in this section, unless otherwise stated. References to a numbered "Condition" shall be to the relevant Condition in the Terms and Conditions o f the Notes.
Risks relating to the Issuer
General
The Issuer is exposed to a number

<<<

 of risks in connection with its business activities. If the Issuer fails to manage this exposure, it may incur financial losses and its reputation may be damaged. In the Issuer's view, efficient risk management is a crucial precondition for

<<<

 competent financial business management, and risk management is therefore seen as one of the Issuer's core competencies. The Issuer's Board of Directors determines the Issuer's overall risk tolerance, and issues instructions and guidelines

<<<

 for measuring, monitoring and reporting risk. The Issuer defines and manages exposure to the following main types of risk:
Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the failure of any borrower, bond issuer or counterparty to honour its payment

<<<

 obligations to the Nykredit Realkredit Group. Credit risk is chiefly related to the Issuer's lending activities and to a lesser degree the Issuer's trading and investing activities. The Group Credits division of the Nykredit Realkredit Group

<<<

 monitors credit risk and provides management with reports on a current basis.
Traditional credit risk stems from the loan portfolio, undrawn credit facilities, guarantees and investments. The Issuer has a counterparty risk in connection with

<<<

 financial derivatives in the form of outstanding positive market value, which depends on market factors. The counterparty risk on financial derivatives is reduced through netting agreements and margin calls in accordance with standard documentation

<<<

 such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") and the International Capital Market Association ("ICMA") with major counterparties.
Settlement and delivery risk derives from securities, derivatives and foreign exchange

<<<

 trading. In order to reduce the risk of foreign exchange-related transactions, the Issuer participates in the Continuous Linked Settlement
12

cooperation as a third-party member, which ensures that no payment transfers are made until opposite

<<<

 payments have been registered.
The Issuer's credit policy guidelines are laid down in the Board of Directors' credit instructions. The purpose of the credit policy is to ensure that the Issuer does not assume risk in connection with counterparties

<<<

 or sectors which is not within the risk limits laid down. As a result of the credit policy, the Issuer is mainly exposed to Danish counterparties and to other OECD-based counterparties. The Issuer has only limited exposure to nonOECD counterparties

<<<

.
Adverse changes in the credit quality of the Issuer's borrowers or other counterparties could affect the recoverability and value of the Issuer's assets and require an increase in provisions made for bad and doubtful debts and other provisions

<<<

.
Given that the Issuer's loans in its capital centres are secured by mortgages over real property, the credit risk may partly be related to the performance of the real estate and housing markets primarily in Denmark but also in other countries

<<<

 where the Issuer operates or will operate in future.
There can be no guarantees regarding the future development of the value of the collateral. Should the prices of real property and the housing market substantially decline, this could affect

<<<

 the Issuer's financial position and, in turn, its ability to service the Notes.
There are many circumstances that affect the level of credit loss, early repayments, withdrawals and final payments of interest and principal amounts, such as changes

<<<

 in the economic climate, both nationally and internationally, and changes regarding taxation, interest rate developments, inflation and/or the political environment. Borrowers may default on their loans as a result of interest rate increases

<<<

 or as a result of adverse developments in their personal circumstances, such as a redundancy or divorce. Defaults by borrowers could jeopardise the Issuer's ability to make payments in full or on a timely basis on the Notes.
Market risk
Market

<<<

 risk is defined as the risk of a loss prompted by unfavourable fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Issuer's overall risk limits are laid down in the Board of Directors' market risk instructions. The

<<<

 Board of Directors has delegated market risk limits to the Group Executive Board, which has in turn delegated the limits to the various trading units within the Issuer.
Market risk is monitored on an intra-daily basis in an integrated system

<<<

. Risk limits are laid down both in general - in the form of Value-at-Risk ("VaR") - and in respect of gross/net positions, volatility and gamma risk. The Issuer's exposure to equity price risk is limited.
Fluctuations in the debt, foreign exchange

<<<

 or equity markets may affect the market value and liquidity of the Issuer's assets. In addition, the occurrence of such events may have an adverse impact on the revenue generated from the Issuer's primary activities.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity

<<<

 risk is defined as the risk of markedly higher funding costs and/or inability to honour payments when due. The Board of Directors' liquidity instructions contain liquidity risk limits for the Issuer.
Currently, the Issuer's loans are primarily

<<<

 match-funded by the issue of covered bonds. The loan rate equals the yield-to-maturity of the bonds or other securities sold. Fixed-rate loans have fixed funding throughout the loan term. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans have no fixed funding

<<<

, but are funded by bonds with maturities between one and 11 years. On refinancing, the loan rate is adjusted to the yield-to-maturity of the bonds sold for the purpose of refinancing. The liquidity risk is therefore primarily limited to the

<<<

 risk of the borrowers not paying interest or principal on the loans when due. The Board of Directors' liquidity instructions contain liquidity risk limits for the Issuer.
13

Operational risk
Operational risk arises from human errors and system

<<<

 faults, insufficient or defective internal procedures or external events. Operational risk also includes risk pertaining to reputation and strategy as well as legal risk.
Operational risk is chiefly handled by way of a comprehensive setup of

<<<

 office procedures and controls. Also, the setup comprises IT contingency plans. The internal audit division checks the contents of and compliance with office procedures on a continuous basis.
If any of these procedures and controls fail, the

<<<

 Issuer may be exposed to additional costs and liabilities.
Risk pertaining to implementation of new regulation
In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopted proposals imposing, among other things, stricter capital and

<<<

 liquidity requirements on banks ("Basel III"). On 20 July 2011, the European Commission presented a proposal to review the CRD, including implementation of Basel III in the EU. The final legislative documents were published in the Official

<<<

 Journal of the European Communities on 27 June 2013 and took effect as from 1 January 2014.
In Denmark an expert committee was established and mandated by the Minister for Business and Growth to give a recommendation on the criteria and requirements

<<<

 for being a Danish Systemically Important Financial Institution ("SIFI"). On 11 March 2013, the committee published a report which, for example, recommended that Danish SIFIs meet higher regulatory capital requirements than other financial

<<<

 institutions. On 10 October 2013, an agreement between the Danish government and four opposition parties was published concerning regulation of SIFIs and requirements to all commercial and mortgage banks for more and higher-quality capital

<<<

 and more ample liquidity. The Issuer was one of the institutions designated as a Danish SIFI in the political agreement. The final rules have now been implemented in the Danish Financial Business Act. On 24 June 2014 the Issuer was appointed

<<<

 as a SIFI by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (the "Danish FSA"). The stricter capital requirements gradually applies as of 1 January 2015 to be fully met by 1 January 2019.
Further, if Denmark should join the European Banking Union

<<<

, it is most likely that Issuer will be supervised by the European Central Bank ("ECB") rather than the Danish FSA from that point on, due to the SIFI designation.
Risk pertaining to regulatory capital
The Issuer is supervised by the Danish

<<<

 FSA, and is subject to minimum statutory capital levels comparable with those of other banks in Western Europe. Non-compliance with capital requirements may result in administrative actions or sanctions against the Issuer, which may affect

<<<

 the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes.
Competition in the mortgage loan business
The mortgage loan business in Denmark is very competitive. Both traditional and new lenders advertise extensively and use targeted marketing

<<<

 and loyalty schemes in an effort to expand their presence in, or to facilitate their entry into, the market and compete for customers. Increased competition may adversely impact the Issuer's position in the market for mortgage business, which

<<<

 could adversely affect the Issuer's financial position and, in turn, its ability to service the Notes.
Limitations to the liability o f the Issuer
The Issuer shall be liable for damages resulting from any delay or default in performing its

<<<

 obligations if such delay or default is due to errors or negligence. Even in areas where a stricter statutory liability applies, the Issuer shall not be liable for losses due to: (i) the breakdown of/lack of access to IT systems or damage to

<<<

 the data of these systems which can be attributed to the events below regardless of whether the Issuer itself or an external supplier is responsible for the operation of the systems; (ii) failures in the Issuer's power supply or
14

telecommunications

<<<

, statutory intervention or administrative acts, natural disasters, war, insurrections, civil riots, sabotage, terror or vandalism (including computer viruses and hacking); (iii) strike, lockout, boycott or blockade regardless of whether the

<<<

 conflict is directed at or initiated by the Issuer itself or its organisation and regardless of the reason for the conflict. This shall also apply where the conflict only affects part of the Issuer; (iv) other circumstances beyond the Issuer

<<<

's control. The Issuer's exemption from liability shall not apply if: (i) the Issuer should have anticipated the factor causing the loss when the agreement or contract was concluded or (ii) should have avoided or overcome the reason for the

<<<

 loss; or (iii) the Issuer is liable for the factor which caused the loss pursuant to current legislation.
Other risks
The Issuer is subject to extensive legal regulation, and legal amendments may have an adverse effect on the Issuer's potential

<<<

 for continuing its business scope and therefore its financial position and the results of its operations. Further, if the Issuer is unable to recruit competent staff, it may have difficulties in continuing its activities.
The Issuer is operating

<<<

 on a consolidated market where competition is keen and new entrants may erode the business scope. This continued pressure may have an adverse impact on the Issuer's financial position and the results of its operations.
Risks related to the

<<<

 market generally
Set out below is a brief description of certain market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk:
The secondary market generally
The Notes may have no established trading market

<<<

 when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that

<<<

 have a developed secondary market. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of Notes.
Exchange rate risks and exchange controls
Payment of principal and interest on the Notes will be made in euro. This presents certain

<<<

 risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly

<<<

 change (including changes due to devaluation of euro or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency or euro may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in

<<<

 the value of the Investor's Currency relative to euro would decrease (i) the Investor's Currencyequivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (iii) the Investor's Currency

<<<

-equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest

<<<

 or principal than expected, or no interest or principal as measured in the Investor's Currency.
Interest rate risks
Notwithstanding that the rate of interest applicable to the Notes will be reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date

<<<

 thereafter, an investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates during the Initial Period or, as the case may be, during a Reset Interest Period may adversely affect the value of the Notes.
15

In

<<<

 addition, a holder of securities with a fixed interest rate that will be periodically reset during the term of the relevant securities, such as the Notes, is also exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest

<<<

 income.
Factors which are material for the purposes of assessing the market risks associated with the Notes
The Notes may not be a suitable investmentfor all investors
Each potential investor of the Notes must determine the suitability of that

<<<

 investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:
(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information

<<<

 contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement to this Prospectus including, but not limited to, any taxation issues related to purchasing and/or holding the Notes;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge

<<<

 of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources

<<<

 and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments, i.e. euro, is different from the currency in which such potential investor's financial activities are principally

<<<

 denominated;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and
(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios

<<<

 for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Risks related to the structure of the Notes
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are subordinated
Subject to Condition

<<<

 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), the Notes will constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer as described in Condition 4 (Status of the Notes).
The Issuer may issue

<<<

 other obligations or capital instruments that rank or are expressed to rank senior to the Notes or pari passu to the Notes, in each case as regards the right to receive periodic payments (to the extent any such periodic payment has not been

<<<

 cancelled) on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer will be required to pay

<<<

 its unsubordinated creditors and its other subordinated creditors other than the present or future claims of creditors that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes in full before it can make any payments on the

<<<

 Notes. If this occurs, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining after these payments are made to pay amounts due under the Notes.
Loss absorption following a Trigger Event
The Notes are being issued for regulatory capital adequacy purposes

<<<

 with the intention and purpose of being eligible as Additional Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer, the Issuer Group and the Nykredit Holding Group. Such eligibility depends upon a number of conditions being satisfied, which are reflected in the Terms

<<<

 and Conditions of the Notes and which, in particular, require the Notes and the proceeds of their issue to be available to absorb any losses of the Issuer and/or the Group.
16

Accordingly, if at any time the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

<<<

 of the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group has fallen below 7.125 per cent., the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall be reduced as described in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement

<<<

 of the Notes).
Noteholders may lose all or some of their investment as a result of such a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts. Any such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall not constitute an Enforcement Event and

<<<

, following such reduction, Noteholders' claims in respect of principal will, in all cases, be based on the reduced Outstanding Principal Amounts to the extent the Outstanding Principal Amounts have not subsequently been reinstated as described

<<<

 in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes).
In addition, following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest can only continue to accrue on the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts following such reduction, which will be lower than the Original Principal Amount of the Notes.
Following any such reduction, the Issuer will not in any circumstances be obliged to reinstate the Outstanding Principal Amounts, but any

<<<

 reinstatement must be undertaken, subject to compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions, on a pro-rata basis with all other Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) which would, following such reinstatement, constitute Additional

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital.
The market price of the Notes is expected to be affected by fluctuations in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group. Any indication that the Common Equity

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group is trending towards 7.125 per cent. may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. The level of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

<<<

 of the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes.
Investors should note that, while such a reduction is not common, it is an appreciable risk and is not limited

<<<

 to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Resolution tools andpowers under the BRRD
On 2 July 2014, Directive 2014/59/EU providing for the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and

<<<

 investment firms (the "BRRD") entered into force. The BRRD is designed to provide authorities with a credible set of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in an unsound or failing institution so as to ensure the continuity of the

<<<

 institution's critical financial and economic functions, while minimising the impact of the institution's failure on the economy and financial system.
The BRRD provides that it will be applied by Member States from 1 January 2015, except for

<<<

 the general bail-in tool (see below) which is to be applied from 1 January 2016. However, the implementation of the BRRD in Denmark is pending political discussions and the BRRD is currently not expected to enter into force in Denmark until

<<<

 1 June 2015. It is expected that the general bail-in tool will also enter into force in Denmark on 1 June 2015. It is, however, also unclear to what extent the general bail-in tool will be applicable to Danish mortgage credit institutions such

<<<

 as the Issuer. Accordingly, at present final regulations for the crisis management of Danish banks and mortgage credit institutions in Denmark are unknown.
The BRRD contains four resolution tools and powers which may be used alone or in combination

<<<

 where the relevant resolution authority considers that (a) an institution is failing or likely to fail, (b) there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures would prevent the failure of such institution within a

<<<

 reasonable timeframe, and (c) a resolution action is in the public interest: (i) sale of business - which enables resolution authorities to direct the sale of the firm or the whole or part of its business on commercial terms; (ii) bridge institution

<<<

 - which enables resolution authorities to transfer all or part of the business of the firm to a "bridge institution" (an entity created for this purpose that is wholly or partially in public control); (iii) asset separation - which enables

<<<

 resolution authorities to transfer impaired or problem assets to one or more publicly owned asset management vehicles to allow them to be managed with a view to maximising their value through
17

eventual sale or orderly wind-down (this can

<<<

 be used together with another resolution tool only); and (iv) bail-in which gives resolution authorities the power to write down certain claims of unsecured creditors of a failing institution and to convert certain unsecured debt claims (including

<<<

 the Notes) to equity (the "general bail-in tool"), which equity could also be subject to any future application of the general bail-in tool.
The BRRD also provides for a Member State as a last resort, after having assessed and exploited the

<<<

 above resolution tools to the maximum extent possible whilst maintaining financial stability, to be able to provide extraordinary public financial support through additional financial stabilisation tools. These consist of the public equity

<<<

 support and temporary public ownership tools. Any such extraordinary financial support must be provided in accordance with the EU state aid framework.
An institution will be considered as failing or likely to fail when: it is, or is likely

<<<

 in the near future to be, in breach of its requirements for continuing authorisation; its assets are, or are likely in the near future to be, less than its liabilities; it is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as

<<<

 they fall due; or it requires extraordinary public financial support (except in limited circumstances).
In addition to the general bail-in tool, the BRRD provides for resolution authorities to have the further power to permanently write-down

<<<

 or convert into equity capital instruments (such as the Notes) at the point of non-viability and before any other resolution action is taken ("non-viability loss absorption"). Any shares issued to holders of the Notes upon any such conversion

<<<

 into equity may also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool.
For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point of non-viability under the BRRD is the point at which the relevant authority

<<<

 determines that the institution meets the conditions for resolution (but no resolution action has yet been taken) or that the institution will no longer be viable unless the relevant capital instruments (such as the Notes) are written-down

<<<

 or converted or extraordinary public support is to be provided and without such support the appropriate authority determines that the institution would no longer be viable.
The powers set out in the BRRD will impact how credit institutions

<<<

 and investment firms are managed as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors. Once the BRRD is implemented, the Noteholders may be subject to write-down or conversion into equity on any application of the general bail-in tool

<<<

 (to the extent the general bail-in tool is applicable to Danish mortgage credit institutions such as the Issuer) and/or non-viability loss absorption, which may result in such holders losing some or all of their investment. The exercise of

<<<

 any power under the BRRD or any suggestion of such exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the rights of Noteholders, the price or value of their investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations

<<<

 under the Notes.
Minimum level o f own funds and eligible liabilities, total loss absorbing capital and debt buffers
The aim of the new framework under the BRRD is to reduce the risk that taxpayers will have to bear the cost in the event of

<<<

 a banking crisis. As a consequence, pursuant to the BRRD, EU banks will need to hold a minimum level of own funds and eligible liabilities ("MREL"). Parallel to this, the Financial Stability Board ("FSB") has issued a proposal on Total Loss

<<<

 Absorbing Capital ("TLAC"), which sets corresponding requirements for globally systemically important banks. As established in the bills implementing the BRRD in Denmark, the MREL requirement will not be applicable to the Issuer. Instead of

<<<

 the MREL requirement, a debt buffer (in Danish: gldsbuffer) will be applicable to Danish mortgage credit institutions, including the Issuer. The debt buffer shall at any time be 2 per. cent of the relevant mortgage bank's total unweighted

<<<

 loans (in Danish: uvgtede udln). Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Additional Tier 1 Capital, Tier 2 Capital and other unsecured senior debt instruments can be used to fulfil the debt buffer. Capital instruments used to fulfil the debt buffer

<<<

 may not be used to fulfil any of the relevant credit mortgage bank's own funds requirements or combined buffer requirement. First reading of the bills implementing the BRRD and debt buffer ended on 20 January 2015. The bills are currently being

<<<

 subject to debate in the Business, Growth and Export Committee. Second and third reading of the bills are expected to be finalised within the next three to four months. The bills are expected to enter into force on 1 June 2015. Uncertainties

<<<

 exist regarding the debt buffer, and consequently how this could
18

affect the capital requirements faced by the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group, including any impact on the maximum distributable amount and

<<<

 the corresponding risk that future payments on the Notes will be restricted.

No scheduled redemption

The Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for redemption. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Notes at any time

<<<

 (except as provided in Condition 8 (Redemption and Purchase) and, in any such case, subject always to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.)). There will be no redemption at the option of the Noteholders.

Cancellation of Interest

Subject

<<<

 as provided in Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), any payment of interest in respect of the Notes shall be payable only out of the Issuer's Distributable Items and:

(i)

may be cancelled, at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of

<<<

 the Issuer in its sole discretion;

or

(ii)

will be mandatorily cancelled, in whole or in part, to the extent:

(A) that, if the relevant payment were so made, the amount of such payment, when aggregated together with other distributions

<<<

 of the kind referred to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (as transposed and implemented in Denmark), would cause any Maximum Distributable Amount to be exceeded; or

(B) otherwise so required by CRD IV, including the applicable criteria

<<<

 for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments.

The Issuer's Distributable Items will depend to a large extent on the net income earned by the Issuer. As discussed above, the Issuer is entitled to cancel payments of interest in its sole discretion

<<<

 and it is permitted to do so even if it could make such payments without exceeding the limits described in the paragraph immediately above. Notwithstanding the above expectations, payments of interest on the Notes may be cancelled even if 

<<<

(i) holders of the Issuer's shares continue to receive dividends and/or (ii) Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes (if any) remain outstanding and holders of those Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes continue to receive interest payments.

Following

<<<

 any cancellation of interest as described above, the right of Noteholders to receive accrued interest in respect of the relevant Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay interest

<<<

 thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned for any purpose nor will the non-payment of such interest constitute

<<<

 an Enforcement Event.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest payments will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation provision of the Notes, the market

<<<

 price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition

<<<

.
Notes subject to optional redemption by the Issuer or upon the occurrence of a Special Event
Subject as provided herein, in particular to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all, but not some

<<<

 only, of the Notes on the First Call Date or on any Interest Payment Date thereafter at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled. Subject as aforesaid, upon the occurrence

<<<

 of a Special Event, the Issuer may also, at its option, at any time redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled

<<<

.

19

Noteholders should note that the Issuer may redeem the Notes as described in the previous paragraph even if (i) the Outstanding Principal Amounts have been so reduced and (ii) the principal amount of the Notes has not been fully reinstated

<<<

 to the original principal amount of the Notes.
An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not

<<<

 rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.
The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes.

<<<

 At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate.

<<<

 Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
Substitution and variation o f the Notes without Noteholder consent
Subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), if a Special

<<<

 Event has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer may, at its option, and without the consent or approval of the Noteholders, elect either (i) to substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes or (ii) to vary the terms of all (but not some

<<<

 only) of the Notes, so that they become or remain Qualifying Capital Notes.
Save to the extent necessary to ensure they continue to comply with the CRD IV requirements in relation to Additional Tier 1 Capital, Qualifying Capital Notes are securities

<<<

 issued or guaranteed by the Issuer that have, inter alia, terms not materially less favorable to the Noteholders than the terms of the Notes (provided that the Issuer shall have delivered a certificate to that effect signed by two of its Directors

<<<

 to the Fiscal Agent). See Condition 8.6 (Substitution and variation).
Limited enforcement events
The Notes will contain limited enforcement events relating to:
(i) non-payment by the Issuer of any amounts due under the Notes. In such circumstances

<<<

, as described in more detail in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) and subject as provided below, a Noteholder may institute proceedings in Denmark in order to recover the amounts due from the Issuer to such Noteholder; and
(ii) the liquidation

<<<

 or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events), the Notes will become due and payable at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar

<<<

 as it has not been cancelled.
A Noteholder may not itself file for the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
According to Section 234(2) of the Danish Financial Business Act, notwithstanding Section 17(2) of the Danish Bankruptcy Act, if

<<<

 the Issuer cannot meet its obligations regarding capital raised as Additional Tier 1 capital, which as of the date hereof will include the Notes, the Issuer is not considered insolvent. According to Section 17(2) of the Danish Bankruptcy Act

<<<

, a debtor is insolvent, if it cannot meet its obligations as and when they fall due, unless the inability to meet such obligations may be considered to be temporary.
If proceedings with respect to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer

<<<

 should occur, the holders of the Notes would be required to pursue their claims on the Notes in proceedings with respect to the Issuer in Denmark. In addition, to the extent that the holders are entitled to any recovery with respect to the

<<<

 Notes in any such Danish bankruptcy proceedings, such holders would be entitled to a recovery in Danish Kroner or, as the case may be, other currencies, which would be based on the relevant conversion rate in effect on the date the Issuer entered

<<<

 into such liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings.
20

The calculation o f the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios will be affected by a number o ffactors, many o f which may be outside the Issuer's control
The occurrence of a Trigger Event

<<<

 and, therefore a write-down of the Original Principal Amounts, is inherently unpredictable and depends on a number of factors, many of which may be outside the Issuer's control. Because the Relevant Regulator may require the Common Equity Tier

<<<

 1 Capital Ratios to be calculated as of any date, a Trigger Event could occur at any time. The calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios of the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holdng Group could be affected by

<<<

 a wide range of factors, including, among other things, factors affecting the level of the Issuer's and/or the Issuer Group's and/or the Nykredit Holding Group's earnings or dividend payments, the mix of businesses, the ability to effectively

<<<

 manage the risk-weighted assets in both the ongoing businesses and those the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group may seek to exit, losses in commercial banking, investment banking or other businesses, changes in

<<<

 the Issuer Group's and/or the Nykredit Holding Group's structure or organisation, or any of the factors described in "Business Description o fNykredit Realkredit A/S". The calculation of the ratios also may be affected by changes in applicable

<<<

 accounting rules and the manner in which accounting policies are applied, including the manner in which permitted discretion is under the applicable accounting rules is exercised.
Due to the uncertainty regarding whether a Trigger Event will

<<<

 occur, it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, the Notes may be written down. Accordingly, the trading behaviour of the Notes may not necessarily follow the trading behaviour of other types of subordinated securities. Any indication

<<<

 that the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer, the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group is approaching the level that would trigger a Trigger Event may have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes

<<<

. Under such circumstances, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to more conventional investments.
Uncertainties remain regarding the manner in which CRD IV will be

<<<

 interpreted
The defined terms in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes will depend in some cases on the final interpretation of CRD IV. CRD IV is a recently-adopted set of rules and regulations that imposes a series of new requirements, many

<<<

 of which will be phased in over a number of years. Certain portions of the CRD IV Directive required transposition into Danish law, and although the CRR will be directly applicable in each Member State, the CRR leaves a number of important

<<<

 interpretational issues to be resolved through binding technical standards that have been adopted, and will be adopted in the future, and leaves certain other matters to the discretion of the Relevant Regulator. The manner in which the framework

<<<

 and requirements under CRD IV will be applied to the Issuer, the Issuer Group and the Nykredit Holding Group remains uncertain to a degree.
The determination of the Maximum Distributable Amount is particularly complex. The Maximum Distributable

<<<

 Amount imposes a cap on the Issuer's ability to pay interest on the Notes, and on the Issuer's ability to reinstate the principal amounts of the Notes following a reduction upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event.
Additional capital buffer requirements

<<<


Under CRD IV, institutions are required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital equal to 8 per cent. of Risk Weighted Assets (of which at least 4.5 per cent. must be Common Equity Tier 1 capital). In addition to these so-called minimum

<<<

 own funds Pillar 1 requirements, CRD IV (including but not limited to, Article 128) also introduces capital buffer requirements that are in addition to the minimum "own funds" requirements and are required to be met with Common Equity Tier

<<<

 1 capital. It introduces five new capital buffers: (i) the capital conservation buffer, (ii) the institution-specific counter-cyclical buffer, (iii) the global systemically important institutions buffer, (iv) the other systemically important

<<<

 institutions buffer and (v) the systemic risk buffer. The Danish implementation of the capital buffer requirements does not include implementation of the other systemically important institutions buffer. At the time of issuance, no Danish credit

<<<

 institutions have been appointed as a global systemically important institution. Subject as aforesaid and to transitional provisions, these capital buffers, are, at the time of issuance, expected to apply to the Issuer on a solo basis, the

<<<

 Issuer Group on a consolidated basis and the Nykredit Holding Group on a consolidated basis.
21

Under Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive, EU Member States must require that institutions that fail to meet the "combined buffer requirement

<<<

" (broadly, the combination of the capital conservation buffer, the institutionspecific counter-cyclical buffer and the higher of (depending on the institution), the systemic risk buffer, the global systemically important institutions buffer

<<<

 and, in general, the other systemically important institution buffer, in each case as applicable to the institution) will be subject to restricted "discretionary payments" (which are defined broadly by CRD IV as distributions in connection

<<<

 with Common Equity Tier 1 capital, payments on Additional Tier 1 instruments and, under certain conditions, payments of variable remuneration). The restrictions will be scaled according to the extent of the breach of the combined buffer requirement

<<<

 and calculated as a percentage of the profits of the institution since the most recent decision on the distribution of profits or discretionary payment. Such calculation will result in a "maximum distributable amount" in each relevant period

<<<

. As an example, the scaling is such that in the bottom quartile of the combined buffer requirement, no discretionary distributions will be permitted to be paid. As a consequence, in the event of breach of the combined buffer requirement it

<<<

 may be necessary to reduce discretionary payments, including potentially exercising the discretion to cancel (in whole or in part) interest payments in respect of the Notes. Moreover in the event that the combined buffer requirement is no longer

<<<

 met by the credit institution it will be required to submit a capital conservation plan to the Relevant Regulator and if the capital conservation plan is not approved by the Relevant Regulator more stringent restrictions on distributions, than

<<<

 those required subject to Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive, can be imposed on the credit institution. Further, there can be no assurance that any of the combined buffer requirements applicable to the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or

<<<

 the Nykredit Holding Group will not be increased in the future, which may exacerbate the risk that discretionary payments, including payments of interest on the Notes, are cancelled.
In addition to the minimum own funds Pillar 1 capital requirements

<<<

 described above, CRD IV (including but not limited to Article 104(1)(a)) contemplates that competent authorities may require additional "Pillar 2" capital to be maintained by an institution relating to elements of risks which are not fully

<<<

 captured by the minimum own funds Pillar 1 requirements ("additional own funds requirements") or to address macro-prudential requirements.
The national implementation of Article 104(1)(a) of the CRD IV Directive in Denmark currently envisages

<<<

 that "Pillar 2" capital requirements imposed thereunder should not be considered to comprise part of an institution's minimum own funds; however there can be no assurance that any future legislation would not result in an increase to the amount

<<<

 of capital required by an institution in order to comply with the applicable combined buffer requirement and the additional own funds requirement. The EBA published guidelines on 19 December 2014 addressed to national supervisors on common

<<<

 procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process ("SREP") which contained guidelines proposing a common approach to determining the amount and composition of additional own funds requirements and which is to be

<<<

 implemented by 1 January 2016. Under these guidelines, national supervisors should set a composition requirement for the additional own funds requirements to cover certain risks of at least 56 per cent. Common Equity Tier 1 capital and at least

<<<

 75 per cent. Tier 1 capital. The guidelines also contemplate that national supervisors should not set additional own funds requirements in respect of risks which are already covered by capital buffer requirements and/or additional macro prudential

<<<

 requirements; and, accordingly, the combined buffer requirement is in addition to the minimum own funds requirement and to the additional own funds requirement. There can be no assurance as to the relationship between any of the aforementioned

<<<

 or future incremental additional own funds requirements, the combined buffer requirement and the restrictions on discretionary payments, and as to how and when effect will be given to the EBA's minimum guidelines in Denmark, including as to

<<<

 the consequences for an institution of its capital levels falling below the debt buffer, the combined buffer requirement, the additional own funds requirement and the minimum own funds requirement referred to above. There can also be no assurance

<<<

 as to the manner in which additional own funds requirements may be disclosed publicly in the future and under Danish law certain disclosure rules already apply. A Danish credit institution is required to disclose its additional own funds requirement

<<<

 either twice a year or each quarter. Furthermore, any additional own funds requirement laid down by the Danish FSA is required to be published on the website of the relevant credit institution.
The capital requirements applicable to the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group are, by their nature, calculated by reference to a number of factors any one of which or combination of which may not be easily observable or capable of calculation by investors. Holders

<<<

 of the Notes may not be able to predict
22

accurately the proximity of the risk of discretionary payments (of Interest and principal) on the Notes being prohibited from time to time as a result of the operation of Article 141 of the CRD IV

<<<

 Directive as implemented in Denmark.
In addition, CRD IV includes a requirement for credit institutions to calculate, report, monitor and publish their leverage ratios, defined as their Tier 1 capital as a percentage of their total exposure

<<<

 measure. The leverage ratio is required to be maintained at a level of at least 3 per cent. This requirement will be harmonised at EU level from 1 January 2018, until which date regulators may apply such measures as they consider appropriate

<<<

.
The Danish authorities are contemplating potential implementation of a leverage ratio requirement ahead of the finalisation of EU standards. To this end, an expert group was established in 2014 and is expected to publish its report later in

<<<

 2015.
There can be no assurance, however, that the leverage ratio specified above, or any of the minimum own funds Pillar 1 requirements, additional own funds requirements or buffer capital requirements applicable to the Issuer and/or the Issuer

<<<

 Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group will not be amended in the future to include new and more onerous capital requirements, which in turn may affect the Issuer's capacity to make payments of interest on the Notes. See further the risk factors

<<<

 entitled "Cancellation o fInterest".
Risks related to the Notes generally
Because the Notes are held by or on behalf o f Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on the clearing system procedures for transfer, payment

<<<

 and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in the Global Notes, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive

<<<

 Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are in global form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear or Clearstream

<<<

, Luxembourg, as the case may be.
While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to a common depositary. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures

<<<

 of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in such a

<<<

 Global Note.
Meetings o fNoteholders and modification
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities

<<<

 to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
In addition, the Issuer may, subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption

<<<

 etc.), make any modification to the Notes, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the Agency Agreement and/or the Deed of Covenant which is not prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders without the consent of the Noteholders. Any such

<<<

 modification shall be binding on the Noteholders.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks and may be lowered, suspended, withdrawn or not maintained
Each of Fitch and S&P is expected to assign a credit rating to the Notes. In addition, each

<<<

 of Fitch and S&P has assigned credit ratings to the Issuer as described on the front cover of this Prospectus. These ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above

<<<

 and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes or the standing of the Issuer.
23

A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and any rating agency may revise, suspend or withdraw at any time the relevant rating

<<<

 assigned by it if, in the sole judgement of the relevant rating agency, among other things, the credit quality of the Notes or, as the case may be, the Issuer has declined or is in question. In addition, there is no guarantee that any rating

<<<

 of the Notes and/or the Issuer will be maintained by the Issuer following the date of this Prospectus. If any rating assigned to the Notes and/or the Issuer is revised lower, suspended, withdrawn or not maintained by the Issuer, the market

<<<

 value of the Notes may be reduced.
The Issuer is exposed to changing methodology by rating agencies
The Issuer is exposed to changes in the rating methodologies applied by rating agencies. Any adverse changes of such methodologies may materially

<<<

 and adversely affect the Issuer's operations or financial condition, the Issuer's willingness or ability to leave individual transactions outstanding and adversely affect the Issuer's capital market standing.
Change o f law
The Terms and Conditions

<<<

 of the Notes will be governed by the laws of England, except for Condition 4 (Status of the Notes), Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), Condition 8.2 

<<<

(Early redemption upon the occurrence of a Special Event), and Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) which shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, Danish law. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision

<<<

 or change to the laws of England or Denmark or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.
Withholding under the EU Savings Directive
Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required

<<<

 to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State

<<<

 or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State.
On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are

<<<

 required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also expand

<<<

 the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts)

<<<

 where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.
For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during that

<<<

 period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in Austria when they are implemented.
The end of the transitional

<<<

 period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding

<<<

 system in the case of Switzerland).
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act withholding may affectpayments on the Notes
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") impose a new reporting regime and, potentially

<<<

, a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to (i) certain payments from sources within the United States, (ii) "foreign passthru payments" made to certain non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with this new reporting regime,

<<<

 and (iii) payments to certain investors that do not provide identification information with respect to interests issued by a participating non-U.S. financial institution. Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within Euroclear Bank SA

<<<

/NV or Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme (together the
24

"ICSDs"'), in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that FATCA will affect the amount of any payment received by the ICSDs (see "Taxation - Foreign Account Tax

<<<

 Compliance Act."). However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of

<<<

 FATCA withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other

<<<

 custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries

<<<

 with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian

<<<

 or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. Investors should consult their own tax adviser to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are discharged

<<<

 once it has paid the common depositary for the ICSDs (as bearer of the Notes), and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the ICSDs and custodians or intermediaries. Notes where denominations

<<<

 involve integral multiples: Definitive Notes The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum denomination of 200,000 plus one or more higher integral multiples of 1,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not

<<<

 integral multiples of 200,000. In such a case a Noteholder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than 200,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the remainder of such

<<<

 holding without first purchasing a principal amount of the Notes at or in excess of 100,000 such that its holding amounts to 200,000 or above. Further, a Noteholder who, as a result of trading such amount, holds an amount which is less than

<<<

 200,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in respect of such holding (should Definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of the Notes at or

<<<

 in excess of 200,000 such that its holding amounts to a denomination. If Definitive Notes are issued, Noteholders should be aware that Definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of 200,000 may be illiquid and

<<<

 difficult to trade. Interests o f the Joint Lead Managers Certain of the Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future, engage in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform

<<<

 services for, the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.

OVERVIEW OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE IN GLOBAL FORM
Words and

<<<

 expressions defined in "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes " herein shall have the same meanings in this "Overview o fProvisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form ".
Temporary Global Note exchangeable for Permanent Global Note
The

<<<

 Notes will initially be in the form of the Temporary Global Note, without Coupons, which will be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Interests in the Temporary Global Note

<<<

 will be exchangeable, in whole or in part, for interests in the Permanent Global Note, without Coupons, which will also be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, on or after

<<<

 the Exchange Date, upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership. Interest payments in respect of the Notes cannot be collected without such certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership.
Whenever any interest in the Temporary Global

<<<

 Note is to be exchanged for an interest in the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer shall procure (in the case of first exchange) the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of the Permanent Global Note, duly authenticated, to the bearer

<<<

 of the Temporary Global Note or (in the case of any subsequent exchange of a part of the Temporary Global Note) an increase in the principal amount of the Permanent Global Note in accordance with its terms against:
(i) presentation and (in

<<<

 the case of final exchange) surrender of the Temporary Global Note to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent; and
(ii) in either case, receipt by the Fiscal Agent of a certificate or certificates of non-U.S. beneficial ownership,
within seven

<<<

 days of the bearer requesting such exchange.
The Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note shall be equal to the aggregate of the original principal amounts specified in the certificates of non-U.S

<<<

. beneficial ownership as adjusted to reflect any reduction and/or reinstatement pursuant to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) and/or any reduction as otherwise required by then current legislation

<<<

 and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer; provided, however, that in no circumstances shall the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note exceed the initial principal amount of the Temporary Global

<<<

 Note.
Permanent Global Note exchangeable for Definitive Notes
Interests in the Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable, in whole but not in part only and at the request of the bearer of the Permanent Global Note, for Definitive Notes, if

<<<

:
(i) Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other relevant clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention permanently to cease business

<<<

 or in fact does so; or
(ii) any of the circumstances described in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) occurs.
Interests in the Permanent Global Note will also become exchangeable, in whole but not in part only and at the request of the Issuer

<<<

, for Definitive Notes if, by reason of any change in the laws of Denmark, the Issuer will be required to make any withholding or deduction from any payment in respect of the Notes which would not be required if the Notes are in definitive form

<<<

.
Definitive Notes will have attached thereto at the time of their initial delivery Coupons. Definitive Notes will also, if necessary, have attached thereto at the time of their initial delivery Talons and the expression Coupons shall, where

<<<

 the context so requires, include Talons.
28

Whenever the Permanent Global Note is to be exchanged for Definitive Notes, the Issuer shall procure the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of such Definitive Notes, duly authenticated

<<<

 and with Coupons and, if necessary, Talons attached, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note to the bearer of the Permanent Global Note against the surrender

<<<

 of the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent within thirty days of the bearer requesting such exchange.
Each Definitive Note shall state that its Outstanding Principal Amount may be reduced and/or reinstated pursuant

<<<

 to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) or reduced as otherwise required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer and that details thereof may be obtained during

<<<

 normal business hours at the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent.
The Permanent Global Note also provides, inter alia, that:
(i) if Definitive Notes have not been delivered in accordance with the terms of the Permanent Global Note by 6.00

<<<

 p.m. (London time) on the thirtieth day after the day on which such Permanent Global Note becomes due to be exchanged; or
(ii) if the Permanent Global Note (or any part thereof) becomes due and payable in accordance with the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 or the date for final redemption of the Permanent Global Note has occurred, and, in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due with all accrued interest thereon has not been made on the due date for payment by 6.00

<<<

 p.m. (London time) on such due date,
then the Permanent Global Note will become void in accordance with its terms but without prejudice to the rights conferred by the Deed of Covenant.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes
The Terms

<<<

 and Conditions applicable to any Definitive Note will be endorsed on that Note and will consist of the Terms and Conditions set out under "Terms and Conditions of the Notes" below.
The Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes represented

<<<

 by one or more Global Notes will differ from those Terms and Conditions which would apply to the Notes were they in definitive form to the extent described in this "Overview o fProvisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form"
Each Global

<<<

 Note will contain provisions which modify the Terms and Conditions of the Notes as they apply to the relevant Global Note. The following is a summary of certain of those provisions:
Payments: The holder of a Global Note shall be the only person

<<<

 entitled to receive payments in respect of the Notes represented by such Global Note and the Issuer will be discharged by payment to, or to the order of, the holder o f such Global Note in respect o f each amount so paid. Each o f the persons

<<<

 shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the beneficial holder o f a particular nominal amount o f the Notes represented by such Global Note must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be

<<<

, for his share o f each payment so made by the Issuer to, or to the order of, the holder o f such Global Note. For the purpose o f any payments made in respect o f a Global Note, the relevant place o f presentation shall be disregarded in the

<<<

 definition of "Payment Business Day" set out in Condition 2.1 (Definitions).
Notices: Notwithstanding Condition 16 (Notices), while all the Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such Global Note(s) are held in their entirety

<<<

 on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system, the requirement in Condition 16 (Notices) for a notice to be published in a leading English language daily newspaper having general circulation

<<<

 in Europe shall not apply and notices to Noteholders may instead be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system for communication by them to the persons shown

<<<

 in their respective records as having interests therein and, in any case, such notices shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) on the date of delivery to Euroclear and/or Clearstream,

<<<

 Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system.
29

Legend concerning United States persons Permanent Global Notes, Definitive Notes and any Coupons and Talons appertaining thereto will bear a legend to the following effect: "Any United

<<<

 States person who holds this obligation will be subject to limitations under the United States income tax laws, including the limitations provided in Sections 165(j) and 1287(a) of the Internal Revenue Code." Clearing Systems Any reference

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES
Thefollowing is the text o f the Terms and Conditions o f the Notes which will be endorsed on each Definitive Note. The Terms and Conditions applicable to any Global Note will differ from

<<<

 those Terms and Conditions which would apply to a Definitive Note to the extent described under "Overview o f Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form " above.

1.

Introduction

The 500,000,000 Perpetual Non-cumulative Resettable

<<<

 Additional Tier 1 Capital Notes (the "Notes") are issued by Nykredit Realkredit A/S (the "Issuer").

The Notes are the subject of an Agency Agreement (the "Agency Agreement") dated 26 February 2015 between the Issuer and The Bank of New York

<<<

 Mellon as fiscal agent (the "Fiscal Agent", which expression shall include any successor to The Bank of New York Mellon in its capacity as such and together with any additional or successor paying agents appointed from time to time in accordance

<<<

 with the Agency Agreement, the "Paying Agents") and the other agent named in it.
The Notes have the benefit of a deed of covenant dated 26 February 2015 (the "Deed of Covenant").
Certain provisions of these Terms and Conditions (the "Conditions

<<<

") are summaries of the Agency Agreement and the Deed of Covenant and are subject to their detailed provisions. The holders of the Notes (the "Noteholders" or the "holders of the Notes") and the holders of the interest coupons (the "Couponholders

<<<

" or the "holders of the Coupons" and the "Coupons", respectively) are bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the Agency Agreement and the Deed of Covenant applicable to them.
Copies of the Agency Agreement and the

<<<

 Deed of Covenant are available for inspection by Noteholders during normal business hours at the specified office of each of the Paying Agents.

2.

Definitions and Interpretation

<<<

 have the following meanings:

<<<

 appears on the Screen Page as of 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on such Reference Rate Determination Date; or

<<<

 any such Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid

 in a different amount per Relevant Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio, the highest of the amounts so calculated shall apply for the purposes of this Condition 7.1;
(y) to the extent the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into

<<<

 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Higher Trigger Loss Absorbing Instrument or Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instrument is not, or by the relevant Write Down Date will not be, effective for any reason:

<<<


(1) the ineffectiveness of any such reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments shall not prejudice the requirement to effect a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition

<<<

 7.1; and
(2) the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Higher Trigger Loss Absorbing Instrument which is not, or by the Write Down Date will not be, effective

<<<

 shall not be taken into account in determining such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts; and
(z) each of provision (A) and/or (B) above shall be disapplied to the extent the existence of such provision(s) would cause the occurrence

<<<

 of a Capital Event
and
(ii) the amount of a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts that would reduce the Outstanding Principal Amounts to 0.01.
Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest

<<<

For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note shall

<<<

, upon the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts described above, be reduced on a likewise pro-rata basis.

<<<

.
7.2 Reinstatement of the Notes: Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts in accordance with Condition 7.1, the Issuer may, at its discretion, reinstate some or all of the principal amount of the Notes, subject to compliance

<<<

<<<

 write down and reinstatement provisions.
7.3 Reinstatement Limit: Any reinstatement of some or all of the principal amount of all relevant outstanding Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, where the principal amount of such Additional Tier

<<<

 1 Capital instruments has been reduced, may not at any time exceed the reinstatement limit applicable to the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding Group, as applicable, at such time pursuant to the CRD IV requirements 

<<<

(the "Reinstatement Limit"). As of the Issue Date, subject to Condition 7.5, the Reinstatement Limit would be the lower of the Available Reinstatement Amounts calculated for each of the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and/or the Nykredit Holding

<<<

 Group, as applicable, in accordance with Condition 7.4.
7.4 Available Reinstatement Amounts: Pursuant to the CRD IV requirements, as of the Issue Date, the "Available Reinstatement Amount" for each of the Issuer and/or the Issuer Group and

/or the Nykredit Holding Group would be calculated as the amount equal to the profits of (in the case of the calculation of the Issuer's Available Reinstatement Amount) the Issuer or (in the case of the Issuer Group's Available Reinstatement

<<<

 Amount) the Issuer Group or (the case of the Nykredit Holding Group's Available Reinstatement Amount) the Nykredit Holding Group, in each case after the Issuer, the Issuer Group or the Nykredit Holding Group, as the case may be, has taken a

<<<

 formal decision confirming its final profits, multiplied by the ratio of the Original Principal Amount of all relevant outstanding Discretionary Temporary Loss Absorption Instruments, divided by the total Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer, the Issuer

<<<

 Group or the Nykredit Holding Group, as the case may be, in each case at the date of the relevant reinstatement, less:
(i) the sum of any principal amounts of any relevant Discretionary Temporary Loss Absorption Instruments that have already

<<<

 been reinstated during the period to which such profits relate; and
(ii) the sum of any amounts of interest or, as the case may be, other periodic distributions in respect of any relevant Discretionary Temporary Loss Absorption Instruments

<<<

 which were paid or have been calculated (but disregarding any such interest which has been cancelled) during the period to which such profits relate on the basis of an outstanding principal amount which is lower than the Original Principal

<<<

 Amount of such Discretionary Temporary Loss Absorption Instruments.
7.5 Maximum Distributable Amount restriction: A reinstatement as described above shall not be effected in circumstances which (when the aggregate of the reinstatement amounts

<<<

, together with other relevant distributions of the kind referred to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (as transposed and implemented in Denmark), and including any previously reinstated amounts or interest payments referred to in Condition

<<<

 7.4(i) or Condition 7.4(ii)), would cause any Maximum Distributable Amount to be exceeded.
7.6 Miscellaneous provisions applicable to reinstatement: For the avoidance of doubt, at no time may the Outstanding Principal Amounts exceed the Original

<<<

 Principal Amount of the Notes.
To the extent that the principal amount of the Notes has been reinstated as described above, interest shall begin to accrue on the reinstated principal amount of the Notes, and become payable in accordance with

<<<

 the Conditions, as from the date of the relevant reinstatement.

<<<

 euro that the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which

<<<

 it is practicable to do so). If the amount received or recovered is less than the amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note or Coupon, the Issuer shall indemnify it against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event

<<<

, the Issuer shall indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this Condition, it shall be sufficient for the Noteholder or Couponholder, as the case may be, to demonstrate that it would have

<<<

 submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of England and waives any objection to Proceedings in such courts on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for

<<<

 the benefit of each of the holders of the Notes, Coupons and Talons and shall not affect the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions

<<<

 preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not). 19.3 Service of Process: The Issuer irrevocably appoints Kromann Reumert, 42 New Broad Street, London EC2M 1JD, England as its agent in England to receive

<<<

, for it and on its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings in England. Such service shall be deemed completed on delivery to such process agent (whether or not it is forwarded to and received by the Issuer). If for any reason such process

<<<

 agent ceases to be able to act as such or no longer has an address in London, the Issuer irrevocably agrees to appoint a substitute process agent and shall immediately notify Noteholders of such appointment in accordance with Condition 16.

<<<

 Nothing shall affect the right to serve process in any manner permitted by law.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION OF NYKREDIT REALKREDIT A/S
Background
The Danish mortgage system is one of the oldest in the world and dates back to 1797. The Issuer has issued mortgage bonds since 1985 under the name

<<<

 of "Nykredit", and has issued mortgage bonds under other names and through other legal entities since 1851.
Mortgage associations were established to enable their members to reduce their borrowing costs by combining their resources and funding

<<<

 their members' loans through the issuance of mortgage bonds secured against real estate. The formation of mortgage associations provided a cheap and effective lending system in Denmark, and today the Danish mortgage sector contributes significantly

<<<

 to the Danish economy.
The mortgage credit association Nykredit (which later became the public limited company Nykredit Realkredit A/S, as described below) was established on 1 April 1985 through the merger of two other mortgage associations

<<<

 dating back to 1851. Nykredit operated as a mortgage association on a purely wholesale basis until 1989, providing mortgage loans to commercial and personal customers through external distribution channels. In 1989, the mortgage sector in Denmark

<<<

 was deregulated, and banks were authorised to form mortgage banks, and mortgage associations were authorised to convert into public limited companies.
As a result of the deregulation of the mortgage sector, Nykredit changed from a wholesale

<<<

 to a retail business and later expanded its activities to include banking and insurance. In 1991, Nykredit was converted from a mortgage association to a public limited company - a mortgage bank - with a holding company structure. As part of

<<<

 the conversion, Nykredit transferred its assets and liabilities through its holding company Nykredit Holding A/S to the mortgage bank Nykredit A/S (renamed Nykredit Realkredit A/S in 2002 e.g. the Issuer (as previously defined)), which continued

<<<

 the mortgage activities of the former mortgage association. Foreningen Nykredit (the "Nykredit Association"), the members of which were the mortgage borrowers of the mortgage association, became the sole owner of Nykredit Holding A/S at the

<<<

 time of conversion. In 1992, the Issuer merged with IRF Industrifinansiering providing Industriens Realkreditfond (the Industrial Mortgage Fund of Denmark) with a stake in Nykredit Holding A/S.
In 1994, the Issuer formed a wholly-owned subsidiary

<<<

, Nykredit Bank A/S ("Nykredit Bank"), as a corporate bank, which later expanded activities to include personal customers. The Issuer and its subsidiaries are together referred to as the "Nykredit Realkredit Group". In 2000, the Issuer acquired

<<<

 the insurance company stifterne Forsikring (later renamed Nykredit Forsikring A/S), which continued the existing insurance activities of the Nykredit Realkredit Group. Foreningen stifterne (the stifterne Association) became a shareholder

<<<

 of Nykredit Holding A/S.
In 2002 and 2003, the Issuer entered into a number of strategic partnerships, including with Jyske Bank and Spar Nord Bank, concerning the distribution of the Issuer's mortgage loans to strengthen distribution to personal

<<<

 customers.
To further strengthen its distribution capacity to personal customers, the Issuer acquired the mortgage bank Totalkredit A/S ("Totalkredit") in November 2003. Totalkredit is a mortgage bank granting mortgage loans to personal customers

<<<

 through a distribution network of about 60 local and regional banks. Together, these local and regional banks own the company, PRAS A/S, which became a shareholder of Nykredit Holding A/S following the Issuer's acquisition of Totalkredit.
On

<<<

 2 November 2007, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority authorised the Issuer to issue covered bonds pursuant to the then current capital requirements directive.
In October 2008, the Issuer acquired Forstdernes Bank A/S. Forstdernes Bank

<<<

 A/S was fully integrated in the Nykredit Realkredit Group as at 1 April 2010.
51

In March 2010, the Nykredit Realkredit Group sold Nykredit Forsikring A/S to Gjensidige Forsikring ASA. The parties also entered into a distribution agreement

<<<

 according to which the Issuer continues to supply and sell insurance products and services to its customers with Gjensidige as supplier. Personal customers continue to be served under the Nykredit brand, whereas commercial - including agricultural

<<<

 - customers are served under the Gjensidige brand.
Since 1 April 2012, new mortgages to personal customers have been originated by the Issuer's sales force and issued through the Totalkredit brand.
The Nykredit Realkredit Group is one of the

<<<

 largest lenders in Denmark with a 31% market share of total domestic lending as at 31 December 2014 based on the MFI statistics of the Danish Central Bank (in Danish: Danmarks Nationalbank).
Ownership and legal structure
The Issuer is a public

<<<

 limited company registered in Denmark with the Danish Business Authority under CVR no 12 71 92 80.
According to Article 3(2) of the Issuer's Articles of Association, the Issuer's object is to carry on mortgage banking, i.e. activities authorised

<<<

 under current Danish mortgage legislation. Another object is through subsidiaries to carry on other financial business, including banking and asset management. The Issuer's Memorandum of Association does not contain information on the Issuer

<<<

S&P has assigned a long-term unsecured rating to the Issuer with negative outlook, which

<<<

 means that the rating may be downgraded.
Risk Management
The Issuer's Board of Directors is responsible for defining limits to and monitoring group risk as well as approving overall instructions and policies. Risk exposures and activities are

<<<

 reported regularly to the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors has assigned the day-to-day responsibility to the Group Executive Board, which has charge of implementing overall instructions. The continuous risk monitoring and management

<<<

 are the responsibility of committees, each chaired by a member of the Group Executive Board.
The Issuer's most important group committees are the Group Risk Committee, the Group Asset/Liability Committee and the Group Credits Committee.
The

<<<

 Group Risk Committee is charged with assessing all group risk and capital adequacy ratios in the Issuer Group as well as implementing the capital policy. Further, the Group Risk Committee approves measurement methods and models for all types

<<<

 of risk and reports risk to the boards of directors of the group companies.
57

The Group Asset/Liability Committee is charged with the overall asset/liability and liquidity management.
The Group Credits Committee has the overall responsibility

<<<

 for managing group credit risk and market risk. The committee approves or endorses all major risk exposures within the limits provided by the Board of Directors to the Group Executive Board.
The Issuer distinguishes between the following general

<<<

 types of risk:
 Credit risk reflects the risk of loss as a result of the non-performance of counterparties.
 Market risk reflects the risk of loss as a result of movements in financial markets (interest rate, foreign exchange, equity price

<<<

, volatility risk, etc).
 Liquidity risk reflects the risk of loss as a result of insufficient liquidity to cover current payment obligations.
 Operational risk reflects the risk of loss as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes

<<<

, people and systems or external events.
Credit risk
The Board of Directors lays down the overall framework for loans and credits and is presented with the largest credit applications for approval or briefing on a current basis.
Within the framework

<<<

 laid down by the Board of Directors, the Group Executive Board sets out the policies governing the individual business areas and Treasury. On behalf of the Group Executive Board, the Group Credits Committee considers large credit applications

<<<

 on a current basis.
Group Credits is responsible for managing and monitoring credit risk in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Board. The Group Credits Committee reports on individual

<<<

 credit exposures. The Group Credits Committee is responsible for approving credit risk models and reporting credit risk at portfolio level.
The Issuer's local centres are authorised to decide on most credit applications in line with the Issuer

<<<

 Group's aim to process most credit applications locally.
Credit applications exceeding the authority assigned to the centres are processed centrally by Group Credits. The applications submitted are decided by Group Credits unless they involve

<<<

 exposures requiring the approval of the Group Credits Committee or the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors grants or approves loans or credit facilities that, if granted, will bring the Nykredit Realkredit Group's total exposure to any

<<<

 one customer over DKK 200m (approx. EUR 27m) and, subsequently, whenever the exposure exceeds multiples of DKK 100m (approx. EUR 13m).
When processing credit applications, the local centres perform an assessment of the individual customer.

<<<

 The assessment is based on a customer rating computed by the Nykredit Realkredit Group's own credit models. The customer rating is supplemented with an assessment of the customer's financial position and any other relevant matters. In connection

<<<

 with mortgage loan applications, the statutory property valuations are also performed. The overall guidelines on customer assessment and property valuation have been prescribed by Group Credits.
When establishing limits for derivative financial

<<<

 products, the Nykredit Realkredit Group will often demand contracts providing the Nykredit Realkredit Group with a netting option. The contractual framework will typically be based on market standards such as the ISDA or the ICMA agreements

<<<

.
All exposures of a certain size are reviewed at least once a year. This is part of the monitoring of credit exposures based on updated financial and customer information. All exposures showing signs of risk are also reviewed.
58

The Nykredit

<<<

 Realkredit Group uses a statistical model for the ongoing monitoring of market values of properties funded by covered bonds and traditional mortgage bonds. The models are applied to detached houses, terraced houses, holiday homes and owner

<<<

-occupied flats that satisfy specific requirements for loan-to-value ratios, risk classification and time since the last valuation. The statistical valuations are performed centrally and supplemented by local valuations as required. As prescribed

<<<

 by law, market values are monitored at least once a year in respect of commercial properties and at least every third year in respect of detached houses, holiday homes and owner-occupied flats.
A substantial part of the Nykredit Realkredit

<<<

 Group's residential mortgage lending is originated by Danish local and regional banks. In these cases, the bank performs the initial assessment of the customer and valuation of the property.
As a main rule, mortgage loans to personal customers

<<<

 originated by banks under an agreement whereby commission is set off against recognised losses. For the entire loan term, the right of set-off applies to the part of a loan that exceeds 60% of the property value when the loan is issued. In

<<<

 the event of loan losses, the Nykredit Realkredit Group is entitled subsequently to offset recognised losses on the part of the mortgage exceeding 60% of the property value against commission payable to the bank originating the loan.
As a consequence

<<<

 of the set-off agreement, Totalkredit A/S is fully responsible for complying with capital requirements and making impairment charges for loan losses. The capital requirement for credit risk pertaining to mortgage lending in Totalkredit A/S

<<<

 was DKK 6.99bn (approx. EUR 940m) as at 31 December 2014.
Credit risk models
The Nykredit Realkredit Group uses internal models for the determination of credit risk. Credit risk is determined using three key parameters: Probability of Default

<<<

 ("PD"), Loss Given Default ("LGD") and Exposure Value ("EV").
The models used to determine PD and LGD are built on historical data allowing for periods with low as well as high business activity. PD is therefore estimated by weighting current

<<<

 data against data dating back to the early 1990s. Current data carry a 40% weighting, while data from the early 1990s carry a 60% weighting. The LGD level for mortgage products is determined on the basis of loss data relating to the economic

<<<

 downturn in 1991 1993.
With respect to personal customers and small enterprises, PDs are determined on the basis of the customer's credit score and payment patterns. Credit scoring is a statistical calculation of the customer's creditworthiness

<<<

 chiefly based on the customer's financial circumstances.
With respect to other customer segments, statistical models have been developed based on conditional probabilities estimating PDs that factor in business-specific circumstances such as

<<<

 financial data, arrears and loan impairment as well as industry-specific conditions and the macroeconomic climate.
External ratings are used to a very limited extent in respect of a few types of counterparty for which no statistical models

<<<

 can be developed due to the absence of default data. External ratings are converted into PDs.
The PDs of individual customers are converted into ratings from 0 to 10, 10 being the highest rating. Customer ratings are an important element of

<<<

 the credit policy and customer assessment.
LGD is determined for each customer exposure. The LGDs of the majority of the Nykredit Realkredit Group's exposures are determined using internal approaches based on loss and default data. The calculations

<<<

 factor in any security such as mortgages over real estate, including the type of security, its quality and ranking in the order of priority.
59

Mortgage banking is characterised by low LGDs as the security provided by way of mortgages over

<<<

 real estate offers good protection against losses. The following table shows the Nykredit Realkredit Group's mortgage lending by loan segment:

Market risk
The Nykredit Realkredit Group's business activities involve a number of different market risks. The greater part of the Nykredit Realkredit Group's loan portfolio consists of match-funded mortgage loans. Mortgage lending is subject

<<<

 to the balance principle, which defines risk limits to all types o f market risk.
The Nykredit Realkredit Group's market risk relates mainly to investment portfolios. Furthermore, the activities of Nykredit Markets and Nykredit Asset Management

<<<

 involve market risk.
The limits relating to market risk in the Nykredit Realkredit Group, including Value-at-Risk, interest rate, equity price, foreign exchange and volatility risk are subject to approval by the Issuer's Board of Directors

<<<

. Within the limits provided by the Board of Directors, the Group Executive Board assigns or approves market risk limits for group companies. Compliance with risk limits is monitored daily and independently of the acting entities of the Nykredit

<<<

 Realkredit Group.
Market risk on mortgage lending
The Issuer and Totalkredit's mortgage lending complies with the balance principle, which limits market risk. The legislative framework behind the balance principle is the Danish Financial Business

<<<

 Act, the Danish MortgageCredit Loans and Mortgage-Credit Bonds Act, and the Danish Executive Order on Bond issuance, balance principle and risk management (executive order no. 945 of 31 August 2011) (the "Executive Order on Bonds").
The above

<<<

 acts specify risk limits to all types of market risk. The Nykredit Realkredit Group's market and liquidity risk in connection with the issuance of bonds is much lower than the limits prescribed by law because practically all the Issuer's and

<<<

 Totalkredit's mortgage loans are match-funded, which eliminates any market risk.

60

More than 99% of the Nykredit Realkredit Group's mortgage loans are match-funded and have the following characteristics:
 On the granting of loans, the

<<<

 Issuer issues the bonds or other securities that fund the loans on a daily basis;
 The funding matching each loan is sold in the bond or derivatives market;
 The loan rate equals the yield-to-maturity of the bonds or other securities sold

<<<

;
 Fixed-rate loans have fixed funding throughout the loan term. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans do not have fixed funding but are funded by bonds with maturities between 1 and 11 years. On refinancing, the loan rate is adjusted to equal the

<<<

 yield-to-maturity of the bonds funding the loan;
 When loans are prepaid, the matching proportion of the outstanding funding is reduced. Borrowers cover the Issuer's costs pertaining to prepayment;
 The dates for payment of interest and principal

<<<

 on the loans are fixed so that the Issuer receives the funds on or before the date on which the payments to bondholders fall due subject to timely payments by borrowers; and
 The Issuer's earnings margin consists of a separate administration

<<<

 margin, which is calculated on the basis of the debt outstanding, and it may be changed if market conditions change, for instance in loss making periods. In addition, various fees may be charged.
In practice, these characteristics minimise

<<<

 the Issuer and Totalkredit's interest rate, liquidity and refinancing risk on mortgage lending and funding.
The Nykredit Realkredit Group applies a VaR model for its day-to-day management of market risk and for the determination of capital

<<<

 requirements and capital adequacy.
For the purpose of day-to-day business risk management, the Nykredit Realkredit Group calculates VaR at a confidence level of 99% and a time horizon of one day. VaR is calculated for both the trading book

<<<

 and the banking book for internal purposes. When determining capital requirements, the Issuer only calculates VaR for the trading book, whereas Nykredit Bank's calculations include both the trading book and the banking book excluding equities

<<<

.
As a consequence of the Danish Executive Order on capital adequacy, the Issuer and Nykredit Bank are required to calculate a stressed VaR in addition to the current VaR for determining the capital requirement. Stressed VaR is also determined

<<<

 using a confidence level of 99%, but a time horizon of 10 days.
The Nykredit Realkredit Group's internal VaR was DKK 128m (approx. EUR 17m) as at 31 December 2014. According to its model, the Nykredit Realkredit Group would risk losing a maximum

<<<

 of DKK 248m (approx. EUR 33m) at a 99% probability in one day as a consequence of market fluctuations. The Nykredit Realkredit Group's total VaR for the determination of the capital requirement amounted to DKK 2.1bn (approx. EUR 282m) as at

<<<

 31 December 2014.
Liquidity risk
The overall liquidity risk of the Nykredit Realkredit Group is assessed by the Group Asset/Liability Committee, whereas day-to-day liquidity management is performed by the individual group companies.
The Nykredit

<<<

 Realkredit Group has structured its lending in a manner that ensures a high level of liquidity. The greater part of the Nykredit Realkredit Group's lending is mortgage loans funded in accordance with the balance principle. Further, lending

<<<

 by Nykredit Bank is generally funded by deposits.
61

Operational risk
The business areas are responsible for the day-to-day management of operational risk. Operational risk management activities are coordinated centrally to ensure consistency

<<<

 and optimisation across the Nykredit Realkredit Group. The Nykredit Realkredit Group strives to limit operational risk from time to time, taking into consideration the related costs.
Recent Developments
No significant events have occurred in

<<<

 the period up to the date of this Prospectus which affect the financial position of the Nykredit Group.
Legal and Arbitration Proceedings
Owing to its size and business scope, the Nykredit Group is continuously involved in legal proceedings

<<<

 and litigation. The cases are subject to ongoing review, and necessary provisions are made based on an assessment of the risk of loss. Pending cases are not expected to have a significant effect on the Nykredit Group's financial position.

SUBSCRIPTION

<<<

 AND SALE
The Joint Lead Managers have, pursuant to a Subscription Agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") dated 24 February 2015, jointly and severally agreed to subscribe and pay for the Notes at the issue price of 100 per cent. of the principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes. The Issuer will pay a commission to the Joint Lead Managers pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. The Issuer will also reimburse the Joint Lead Managers in respect of certain of their expenses, and has agreed to indemnify

<<<

 the Joint Lead Managers against certain liabilities incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes. The Subscription Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances prior to payment to the Issuer.
United States of America: Regulation

<<<

 S Category 2; TEFRA D
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in the preceding sentence

<<<

 have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or its possessions or to U.S. persons, except in

<<<

 certain transactions permitted by U.S. Treasury regulations. Terms used in the preceding sentence have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder.
Each Joint Lead Manager

<<<

 has agreed that, except as permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering

<<<

 and the Issue Date (the "distribution compliance period") within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons and that it will have sent to each distributor, dealer or person to which it sells the Notes during the

<<<

 distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have

<<<

 the respective meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.
In addition, until forty days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes, any offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether

<<<

 or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
United Kingdom

(a) Financial promotion: it has only communicated or caused to be

<<<

 communicated, and will only communicate or cause to be communicated, any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection

<<<

 with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 would not, if the Issuer was not an authorised person, apply to the Issuer; and
(b) General compliance: it has complied

<<<

 and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

<<<

 Issuer and the Joint Lead Managers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in or from which they purchase, offer, sell or deliver the Notes or have in their possession or distribute such offering material

<<<

, in all cases at their own expense. The Subscription Agreement provides that the Joint Lead Managers shall not be bound by any of the restrictions relating to any specific jurisdiction (set out above) to the extent that such restrictions shall

<<<

, as a result of change(s) or change(s) in official interpretation, after the date hereof, of applicable laws and regulations, no longer be applicable but without prejudice to the obligations of the Joint Lead Managers described in the paragraph

<<<

 headed "General" above.

TAXATION
Persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition o f the Notes should consult their own tax advisers concerning the tax consequences in the light o f their particular situations. No representations

<<<

 with respect to the tax consequences o f any particular Noteholder are made hereby.
Kingdom of Denmark
The following is a summary description o f the taxation in Denmark o f the Notes according to the Danish tax laws in force at the date hereof

<<<

 and is subject to any changes in law and the interpretation and application thereof, which changes could be made with retroactive effect. The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description o f all the tax considerations

<<<

 that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, hold or dispose o f the Notes, and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories o f investors, some o f which (such as professional dealers in securities) may

<<<

 be subject to special rules. Potential investors are under all circumstances strongly recommended to contact their own tax advisor to clarify the individual consequences o f their investment, holding and disposal o f the Notes. The Issuer makes

<<<

 no representations regarding the tax consequences ofpurchase, holding or disposal o f the Notes.
Taxation at source
Under existing Danish tax laws no general withholding tax or coupon tax will apply to payments of interest or principal or other

<<<

 amounts due on the Notes, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to in consolidated Act no. 149 of 9 January 2015, as amended. This will not have any impact on Noteholders

<<<

 who are not in a relationship whereby they control, or are controlled by, the Issuer or where the Noteholders and the Issuer are not controlled by the same group of persons.
Resident Noteholders
Private individuals, including persons who are

<<<

 engaged in financial trade, companies and similar enterprises resident in Denmark for tax purposes or receiving interest on the Notes through their permanent establishment in Denmark are liable to pay tax on such interest.
Capital gains are

<<<

 taxable to individuals and corporate entities in accordance with the consolidated Act no. 1113 of 18 September 2013 (as amended) on taxation of debt, debt claims and financial contracts (in Danish "Kursgevinstloven") (the "Act"). Gains and

<<<

 losses on Notes issued to corporate entities are generally included in the taxable income in accordance with a mark-to-market principle (in Danish "lagerprincippet"), i.e. on an unrealised basis. Gains and losses on Notes issued to individuals

<<<

 are generally included in the taxable income on a realised basis and if the annual gains or losses do not exceed DKK2,000, the gains or losses will be exempt from taxation.
Gains and losses on Notes, which are subject to adjustments on principal

<<<

 or interest as set out in section 29(3) of the Act will be taxable on an annual basis in accordance with a mark-to-market principle (in Danish "lagerprincippet") as further specified in the Act.
A variety of features regarding interest and

<<<

 principal may apply to the Notes. The applicable taxation of capital gains to corporate entities or individuals will depend on the features applicable to the Notes in question.
Pension funds and other entities governed by the Danish act on

<<<

 taxation of pension yield (in Danish "Pensionsafkastbeskatningsloven") would, irrespective of realisation, be taxed on annual value increase or decrease of the Notes according to a mark-to-market principle (in Danish "lagerprincippet") as specifically

<<<

 laid down in the act.
Non-Resident Noteholders
Under existing Danish tax laws, payments of interest or principal amounts to any non-resident Noteholders are not subject to taxation in Denmark, other than in certain cases on payments in respect

<<<

 of controlled debt in relation to
68

the Issuer as referred to under "Taxation at source" above. Thus, no Danish withholding tax will be payable with respect to such payments and any capital gain realised upon the sale, exchange or retirement

<<<

 of a Note will not be subject to taxation in Denmark, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to under "Taxation at source" above.
This tax treatment applies solely to Noteholders

<<<

 who are not subject to full tax liability in Denmark or included in a Danish joint taxation scheme and do not carry on business in Denmark through a permanent establishment.
EU Savings Directive
Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation

<<<

 of savings income, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit

<<<

 of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State.
On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of

<<<

 the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable

<<<

 on securities. The Directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities

<<<

 or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.
For a transitional period

<<<

, Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in Austria when they

<<<

 are implemented.
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland

<<<

 have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") impose a new reporting regime and potentially

<<<

 a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to certain payments to (i) any non-U.S. financial institution (a "foreign financial institution", or "FFI" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a "Participating FFI" by entering into an agreement

<<<

 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to provide the IRS with certain information in respect of its account holders and investors or is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA and (ii) any investor (unless otherwise

<<<

 exempt from FATCA) that does not provide information sufficient to determine whether the investor is a U.S. person or should otherwise be treated as holding a "United States account" of the Issuer (a "Recalcitrant Holder"). The Issuer may be

<<<

 classified as an FFI.
The new withholding regime is now in effect for payments from sources within the United States and will apply to "foreign passthru payments" (a term not yet defined) no earlier than 1 January 2017.
The United States and

<<<

 a number of other jurisdictions have announced their intention to negotiate intergovernmental agreements to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (each, an "IGA"). Pursuant to FATCA and the "Model 1" and "Model 2" IGAs released by the United

<<<

 States, an FFI in an IGA signatory country could be treated as a "Reporting FI" not subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives. Further, an FFI in an IGA jurisdiction generally would not be required to withhold under FATCA

<<<

 or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) (any such withholding being "FATCA Withholding") from payments it makes. Under each Model IGA, a Reporting FI would still be required to report certain information in respect of its account holders

<<<

 and investors to its home government or to the IRS. The United States and Denmark have entered into an agreement (the "United States-Denmark IGA") based largely on the Model 1 IGA.
69

If the Issuer is treated as a Reporting FI pursuant to

<<<

 the United States-Denmark IGA it does not anticipate that it will be obliged to deduct any FATCA Withholding on payments it makes. There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will be treated as a Reporting FI, or that it would in the

<<<

 future not be required to deduct FATCA Withholding from payments it makes. Accordingly, the Issuer and financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made may be required to withhold FATCA Withholding if (i) any FFI through

<<<

 or to which payment on such Notes is made is not a Participating FFI, a Reporting FI, or otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA or (ii) an investor is a Recalcitrant Holder.
Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within

<<<

 Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (together, the "ICSDs"'), it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Notes by the Issuer, any Paying Agent and the common depositary given that

<<<

 each of the entities in the payment chain between the Issuer and the participants in the ICSDs is a major financial institution whose business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will

<<<

 be unlikely to affect the Notes. The documentation expressly contemplates the possibility that the Notes may go into definitive form and therefore that they may be taken out of the clearing systems. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA

<<<

 compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. However, Definitive Notes will only be printed in remote circumstances.
FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part

<<<

 on regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and

<<<

 to payments they may receive in connection with the Notes.
The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT")
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium

<<<

, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States").
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including

<<<

 secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain

<<<

 dealings in Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State

<<<

 in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
A joint

<<<

 statement issued in May 2014 by ten of the eleven participating Member States indicated an intention to implement the FTT progressively, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain derivatives, with this initial implementation

<<<

 occurring by 1 January 2016. The FTT, as initially implemented on this basis, may not apply to dealings in the Notes.
The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and is the subject of legal challenge

<<<

. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders o f Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
