Company Highlights
Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro S.A.P.I. de C.V. (referred to as "Oro Negro" or the "Company" herein) reports revenues of US$230.9M for 2015. Revenues for 2015 increased US$9.0M compared to 2014. Our

<<<

 increase in revenues is largely due to Decus, which had a full year under operation and to an uptime improvement.
Like every business in our industry, Oro Negro is facing significant challenges. Our challenges are a direct result of the challenges

<<<

 our only customer, PEMEX, also faces. We continue to partner with PEMEX to address the collective issues we face, but these challenges directly and negatively impacted our liquidity, which remains extremely limited. As a result, the Company

<<<

 must continue to make difficult choices on the timing for paying its obligations, while simultaneously ensuring that our rigs are operating safely and consistent with the expectations of PEMEX. The Company did not pay the outstanding principal

<<<

 and accrued interest in respect of the First Priority Oro Negro Impetus Pte.Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2015 (the "2015 bonds" and referred to herein as the "US$175.0M bridge bond"), which amounts were due as of the maturity date of

<<<

 the 2015 Bonds on December 4, 2015. On April 29, 2016, management negotiated and signed a new agreement with the bondholders with a maturity date of January 2019. All outstanding defaults were waived and no further action has been taken against

<<<

 Oro Negro.
Despite recent financial difficulties, the Company continued to successfully execute on its operational strategy during 2015. Oro Negro's fleet achieved another year with high uptime levels, registering an average uptime of 99.3

 Rig 3's contract expiration date, September 11, 2015, PEMEX and Oro Negro signed an early termination notification.
Operational Results
As of December 31, 2015, our fleet consists of five premium jack-ups and one modular rig, providing enough

<<<

 scale to generate substantial operating synergies, and to position the Company as a relevant operator of high specification equipment in Mexico, with five of our rigs already under contract with PEMEX.
In December 2015, the Company secured

<<<

 a 5-year contract with Pemex for the Impetus rig.
Oro Negro is committed to maintain the highest safety and environmental responsibility standards. We operate under a Quality Management System (QMS) with its principles founded in our ZERO HARM
