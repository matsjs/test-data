Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Oslo, 10 April 2017

Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Bond Trustee") for the bondholders (the "Bondholders

<<<

") in the above bond issues ("IMSK12" and "IMSK13" respectively) with I.M. Skaugen SE as issuer (the "Issuer").

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 21 February 2012 for IMSK12 and

<<<

 the bond agreement dated 29 March 2012 for IMSK13 (jointly the "Bond Agreements") as amended from time to time, unless otherwise stated herein.

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer

<<<

, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1. BACKGROUND

Reference is made to the Issuer's Preliminary Result 2016, the Summons to Bondholders Meeting in IMSK13 sent out by the Issuer on

<<<

 9 January 2017, Summons to Bondholders Meeting in IMSK12 and IMSK13 sent out by the Issuer on 15 February 2017 and Stock Exchange Notice sent out by the Issuer on 4 April 2017. The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that it is in advanced

<<<

 discussions with its secured lenders regarding the refinancing of the 2017 debt maturities. Certain issues relating to intercreditor items, and in particular between the secured lenders, remain outstanding before a final solution is in place

<<<

. The senior facility agreement, the Swedbank swap, the IMSK12 bond and the IMSK13 bond all had maturity date 6 April 2017 originally. The Issuer's proposed refinancing solution is in line with the previously stated intention of altering maturity

<<<

 and by this making all creditors whole over time.

The Issuer has developed a Small Scale LNG logistics solution (SSLNG) - providing natural gas for power generation and transportation and on this basis signed long-term contracts for the time

<<<

 charter of three Multigas (MG) vessels on 23 January 2017. This is for a project representing a "proof of concept" o f its SSLNG logistics solutions - providing natural gas for existing power generation plants. The SSLNG concept reduces the

<<<

 need for capital expenditures in shore based infrastructure and has a much shorter lead time from decision to start up of LNG consumption at the power plants vs traditional large scale solutions. This makes SSLNG an attractive solution for

<<<

 power plant clients, and especially "stranded clients" without access to gas today due to lack of availability of LNG by large scale solutions or lack of natural gas accessible by pipelines.

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate

<<<

 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

The SSLNG project is moving ahead and now a term sheet for a gas purchase agreement has been entered between one of the project sponsors (the largest power plant) and an international recognized commodity trader

<<<

 for their purchase and the delivery of LNG to the project that the Issuer's vessels will service. All relevant shore based equipment, including the critical regasification facilities, has been acquired by the power plants and the client sponsors

<<<

. This site specific equipment is in the process of being shipped from China and India - soon to be installed at site. The execution of the project is slightly delayed to previous anticipated commencement, and the Issuer now expects start-up

<<<

 late 2Q17 by the Issuer positioning its ships to commence delivery of the first LNG to commission these facilities in June.
There are still outstanding issues regarding financial close that has not yet been reached to enable the start up to

<<<

 be reconfirmed, but as of now the completion of the gas purchase agreement and the execution o f the Issuer's logistic contracts are the main outstanding elements to complete what the project needs. For the execution of the logistics contract

<<<

, comfort and approvals regarding the completion of the Issuer's pending refinancing of the maturity debt, including the topics specified in this Summons, is needed to ensure the Issuer's ability to execute its part.
The revenues under these

<<<

 SSLNG contracts will, when reconfirmed and all fully operational, be about USD 42 mill annualized. The rates within SSLNG have typically been about 60-70% higher than what is achieved in the traditional LPG trades, and hence the contract is

<<<

 not only a "proof of concept" of a novel logistic concept, but an important financial milestone for the Issuer. Such LNG contracts are expected to allow the Issuer to service all its current debt over time.
The Issuer believes that the proposal

<<<

 will allow all creditors to be made whole over time, on the basis of successful execution of the Africa LNG project.
The Issuer and the secured lenders have for a time discussed the commercial terms for each lender, and are currently discussing

<<<

 the intercreditor agreement and execution documentation. It is the Issuer's opinion that his work does not as such have any impact on the Bondholders or the proposal to the Bondholders. Below is a description of the commercial terms of the

<<<

 current proposal towards the secured lenders setting out the key terms relevant for the Bondholders. The current proposal is subject to inter alia the secured lenders' credit committee approvals. As part of the refinancing proposed the Issuer

<<<

 may also make certain amendments to its operational sale leaseback arrangements. Until the Africa LNG project is operational this includes adjustments of the bareboat rates in line with the underlying earnings o f the leased vessels.
Towards

<<<

 the Nordea bank syndicate, the current proposal involves an extension of the 1st lien bank debt until 6 April 2018. The facility will have unchanged interest rate with quarterly interest payments and quarterly amortisation of USD 1.0m. The

<<<

 existing Equity Ratio covenant in the Issuer will be reduced to 5.0%, and the original Free Cash covenant of USD 3.0m in Somargas II will be reinstated over this period.
Towards Swedbank, the current proposal involves an extension of the 2nd

<<<

 lien facility until 6 April 2018, however the existing swap will be converted into a USD loan facility based on the applicable fx rate on or about the day all Conditions Precedents are fulfilled, expected to be 27 April 2017, based on the mark

<<<

-to-market balance of the facility at this date. The loan facility will have an interest rate of 3m Libor + 500bps payable quarterly with first payment date being 30 September 2017, but no quarterly amortisation.
The Issuer aims to finalize

<<<

 the discussions and execute the agreements with its secured lenders in a timely manner, and signing of such agreements are Conditions Precedents for the execution of the proposal to Bondholders described below.
-2-

The Issuer proposes to

<<<

 the Bondholders to combine IMSK12 and IMSK13 into a new USD denominated bond 1MSK14 with maturity 6 April 2018. The outstanding amount of the new bond will equal current outstanding amount, excluding Issuer's Bonds (as described below) which

<<<

 will be cancelled, multiplied by 101.5% plus unpaid interest from the Interest Payment Date in November 2016 to 6 April 2017 for IMKS12 and unpaid interest from the Interest Payment Date in October 2016 to 6 April 2017 for IMSK13, converted

<<<

 from NOK to USD based on the same fx rate as Swedbank uses for the conversion of the swap (the applicable fx rate on or about the day all Conditions Precedents are fulfdled, expected to be 27 April 2017). Bondholders in IMSK12 will hold 39

<<<

.51% and Bondholders in IMSK13 will hold 60.49% of IMSK14 respectively, based on the described conversion. The Bondholders will receive coupon of 3m Libor + 900bps from and including 6 April 2017 with quarterly payments starting 31 December

<<<

 2017. For the avoidance of doubt, Bondholders will not receive penalty interest on IMSK12 and IMSK13 for the period 6 April 2017 until IMSK14 is issued. Coupon payments will be in cash as long as certain criteria are fulfilled, including maintaining

<<<

 minimum Free Cash, if not it will be made in PIK. To facilitate cash coupon 31 December 2017 an escrow account mechanism will be put in place, where cash can be transferred each of the months September, October and November provided that certain

<<<

 criteria are met, including maintaining minimum Free Cash.
The IMSK12 Bond Issue with NOK 340m outstanding whereof NOK 161.5 million (approx. USD 18.6 million) is voting bonds (net of current Issuer's Bonds of NOK 178.5m).
The IMSK13 Bond Issue

<<<

 with NOK 350m outstanding whereof NOK 243.5 million (approx. USD 28.1 million) is voting bonds (net of current Issuer's Bonds of NOK 106.5m).
The proposal is supported by the Board of Directors of I.M. Skaugen SE. A formal approval from the

<<<

 Board of Directors of I.M. Skaugen SE will be obtained prior to the Bondholders Meeting.
