Application Form*
(Private Placement of a new Tranche A

<<<

 under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement)
*All terms not specifically defined but used herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the attached Amended and Restated Loan Agreement

Cecon ASA February 2011

Cecon ASA (the "Company

<<<

") and its subsidiaries are undergoing a debt restructuring (the "Restructuring") of the 11.0 per cent Cecon ASA Senior Secured Callable and Putable Bond Issue 2007/2012, (the "2007 Bond Loan") and the 25.0 per cent Cecon ASA Secured Bond Issue

<<<

 2009/2010 (the "2009 Bond Loan"), jointly referred to as (the "Bond Loans"). Upon completion of the Restructuring an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement to be agreed between the Company and the Loan Trustee, a substantially final version of

<<<

 which is attached as Appendix 1 hereto (the "Amended and Restated Bond Agreement"), will govern the Bond Loans. As part of the Restructuring the Company will issue a new tranche of the Bond Loans raising USD 5 to 7 million in new cash, referred

<<<

 to as the Tranche A Bonds in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the "New Loan"). USD 4 of the Tranche A Bonds have been reserved for subscription by the bondholders in the 2007 Bond Loan and the 2009 Bond Loan as per the further details

<<<

 of the term sheet for the Restructuring attached to the summons of the bondholders meeting published on 21 February 2011 (the "Private Placement"). To be eligible to purchase bonds in the New Loan, bondholders in the 2007 Bond Loan and the

<<<

 2009 Bond Loan must subscribe for bonds in a principal amount not less than the USD amount equivalent of 50,000 (the "Minimum Subscription Amount"), but: (i) the Company may allocate to any Bondholder bonds in the New Loan in a principal amount

<<<

 less than the amount subscribed for by that Bondholder; and (ii) to the extent possible without breaching the prospectus rules of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act Chapter 7, the Company intends to allocate the portion of the New Loan that

<<<

 is available to Bondholders among participating Bondholders on a strict pro rata basis. If, for any reason, the Company is unable to allocate the New Loan in this manner without breaching the prospectus rules of the Norwegian Securities Trading

<<<

 Act Chapter 7, the Company may, in consultation with the Loan Trustee, adopt alternative allocation principles which may include: (i) if a Bondholder's pro rata share of the New Loan would be less than the Minimum Subscription Amount, rounding

<<<

 the principal amount of the bonds in the New Loan allocated to that Bondholder to zero or the Minimum Subscription Amount (whichever is closer to that Bondholder's pro rata share of the New Loan); (ii) disregarding subscriptions below 50,0

<<<

00; or (iii) preparing and distributing a prospectus designed to comply with the prospectus rules of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act Chapter 7.

The denomination of the Tranche A Bonds will be USD 1. Subscription of Tranche A Bonds will

<<<

 entitle the Applicant (as defined below) to Warrants issued by the Company. A total of 65,000,000 Warrants will be issued, each entitling the holder to subscribe for one share at NOK 0.65 on or before the date that is 10 banking days prior

<<<

 to the second anniversary of the Restructuring. The Warrants will have customary antidilution protection. The total number of Warrants will be divided among the applicants for the Tranche A Bonds on a pro rata basis based on their allocation

<<<

 of Tranche A Bonds. If the Tranche A Bonds are fully subscribed, each Tranche A Bond will entitle the subscriber to 9.286 Warrants. The Warrants will be issued in the VPS only and it will not be possible to receive the Warrants in Euroclear

<<<

. In order to receive Warrants the Applicants must accordingly open their own VPS account or instruct a VPS nominee to hold the Warrants on their behalf.
Participants in the Private Placement holding bonds in the Bond Loans will be entitled

<<<

 to receive Tranche B Bonds in exchange for parts or all of such bonds. The nominal value of bonds in the Bond Loans that each participant would be entitled to exchange into Tranche B Bonds (the "Entitlement Value") will be a function of the

<<<

 Allocated Bonds (as defined below) and total issue volume of Tranche A Bonds, and cannot under any circumstances be greater than the respective participant's holding of bonds in the Bond Loans at the time of subscribing in the Private Placement

<<<

. If the Tranche A Bonds are fully subscribed, a subscriber's Entitlement Value will be the lesser of (i) approximately 16 times the principal amount of Tranche A Bonds subscribed for by that subscriber, and (ii) 65% of the bonds in the Bond

<<<

 Loan held by that subscriber on the date of this Agreement. Please refer to paragraph 4 of the indicative term sheet posted on Stamdata (www.stamdata.no) on 21 February 2011 (the "Term Sheet") for further details on the Tranche B Bonds and

<<<

 calculation of the Entitlement Value. Hence, participants must confirm the amount of bonds currently held in the Bond Loans and provide satisfactory proof of ownership in connection with making their subscriptions in the Private Placement.

<<<

 In order to receive Tranche B Bonds participants must transfer bonds with a value equivalent to the Entitlement Value to the Settlement Agent (as defined below) free of payment no later than the day prior to the Settlement Date, and will in

<<<

 return receive Tranche B Bonds free of payment carrying the same nominal value once payment and delivery of Tranche A Bonds are completed. Participants should note that the transfer requires their action by instructing their individual VPS

<<<

 account manager or their nominee.
Application guidance: Application for the New Securities (as defined below) will take place from and including 28 February 2011 to 4 March at 14:00 hours CET (the "Application Period"). The Company reserves

<<<

 the right, to close or extend the Application Period at any time, depending on the number or size of Applications received.
By signing and executing this Application Form (the "Agreement"), the undersigned applicant (the "Applicant") irrevocably

<<<

 confirms its request to subscribe for the number of Tranche A Bonds specified below (the "Application") on the terms of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The Applicant further confirms and accepts that all acceptances, confirmations
