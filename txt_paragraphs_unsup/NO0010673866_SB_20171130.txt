Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Nordic

<<<

 Trustee AS acts as trustee (the "Bond Trustee") for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in each of the above listed bond issues (together the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issues") issued by Island Offshore Shipholding L.P. as issuer (the "Issuer

<<<

"). The Issuer and the subsidiaries outlined in Annex 1 are referred to as the "Group".

All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally dated 22 March 2013 as amended and restated on

<<<

 29 March 2016, made between the Bond Trustee and the Issuer (the "Bond Agreem ent"), unless otherwise stated herein.

The information in this summons letter regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond

<<<

 Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1.

OVERVIEW OF THE RESTRUCTURING

1.1 Background
In March 2016 the Issuer and certain of the entities of the Group reached agreement with the bank lenders having

<<<

 provided secured loans to finance their vessels. The agreement contained specific deferment of instalments and amendments to terms of such loans in order to assist these entities during the ongoing downturn in the market. In order to implement

<<<

 the agreement with the bank lenders certain amendments were also required to be made to the Bond Agreement and these were approved by the Bondholders on 16 March 2016.

The continued deterioration of the market conditions for owners and operators

<<<

 of offshore service vessels required the Issuer to re-commence the discussions with its key stakeholders on the conditions for a further restructuring of the long term debt of the Issuer and those of its subsidiaries having financed their vessels

<<<

 with secured bank debt.

Negotiations have been conducted with the above referred financial institutions having provided such secured bank financing (the "Secured Lenders"), the suppliers having provided secured and unsecured loans to various

<<<

 members of the Group (the "Lending Suppliers"), certain Bondholders in each of the Bond Issues, the principal owners of the Issuer; Borgstein Skipsinvest AS, Island

2/11
Investment L.L.C. and Amnor L.L.C. (together the "Principal Owners"

<<<

) and Borgstein AS and Alpha Marine Services, L.L.C. in their capacity as guarantors (the "Guarantors") in respect of the limited guarantee issued by them in favour the Secured Lenders financing two of the Issuer's vessels.
The negotiations

<<<

 with the Bondholders have been held with key Bondholders in each Bond Issue holding more than two thirds of the Outstanding Bonds in Tranche A and all of the Outstanding Bonds in Tranche B (together the "Majority Bondholders").
The Majority

<<<

 Bondholders have indicated their support for the Restructuring (as set forth in Section 3 (The Proposal) and Section 4 (Conditions) below).
In addition to this summons letter, the Issuer has provided a separate presentation (the "Company Presentation

<<<

") (enclosed as Annex 1) which is intended to give background information and an update on the operational status of the Group. On 1 September 2017, the Issuer released its financial report for Q2 2017 which has been available on Stamdata.no

<<<

 in a separate presentation entitled "Financial Report".
Bondholders are encouraged to read these documents to obtain an understanding of the proposed restructuring.
1.2 Key terms of the restructurings
1.2.1 The different restructurings Each

<<<

 member of the Group subject to the ongoing restructuring is restructured on a standalone basis, save for the Issuer and its wholly owned subsidiary Island Offshore X KS (together with its general partner, Island Offshore X AS; "IO X") where

<<<

 existing parent company guarantees from the Issuer to the Secured Lenders financing the vessels of IO X tie these entities together.
As to the other participating members of the Group, the Issuer holds a majority of the shares/partnership interest

<<<

 in these but has not provided any corporate guarantees as to the debt of these entities. However, the operations in the Issuer and IO X are to a certain extent integrated with and dependant on the operations of the other members of the Group

<<<

 and related entities. All vessels in the Group are under management by the same entity; Island Offshore Management AS ("IOM"). IOM is related to the Group through common ultimate ownership but is as such not part of the Group. IOM is also the

<<<

 holder of certain end-client contracts for vessels owned by the Issuer. Finally, there are intra-group debt and amounts outstanding between IOM and individual members of the Group. Consequently, the contemplated restructuring of the Issuer

<<<

 and IO X is also conditional upon (unless waived) the due execution and implementation of the restructuring of the other members of the Group (being Island Offshore III AS/ Island Offshore XI AS ("IO III"), Island Offshore VIII AS and KS (

<<<

"IO VIII"), Island Offshore LNG Invest AS and KS ("IO LNG Invest"), Island Offshore LNG AS and KS ("IO LNG") and Island Offshore XII Ship AS ("IO XII"), hereinafter together referred to as the "Other Group Companies" and the contribution of

<<<

 funds to and by IOM as well as by the Principal Owners.
1.2.2 Secured debt Each of the restructurings described herein contemplates a restructuring period commencing on 30 June 2017 and ending on 31 December 2020 (the "Restructuring Period

<<<

"), during which the terms of

3/11

the Group's service of debt to the Secured Lenders (as defined below), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, shall be amended.

The contemplated amendments to the senior secured bank

<<<

 facilities provided by the Secured Lenders financing the vessels owned by the Group (the "Facility Agreements") during the Restructuring Period can be summarised as follows:

(i)

Extension of maturities under the Facility Agreements to 31

<<<

 December 2020, and

corresponding extension of the term of any related bank guarantee or GIEK guarantee;

(ii)

Deferral of due but unpaid instalments of principal outstanding on 30 June 2017;

(iii)

An amended amortisation profile for the

<<<

 Restructuring Period based on agreed fixed

amounts to be paid by the Issuer and each applicable member of the Group under their

respective Facility Agreements, disregarding the reduction in fixed amortisation agreed in

March 2016 (the "Agreed

<<<

 Fixed Amortisation");

(iv)

Separate cash sweep provisions for each restructuring securing the applicable Secured

Lenders additional amortisation if such member of the Group performs better than

expected during the Restructuring Period;

<<<



(v)

Redemption of the MNOK 75 guarantee issued by the Guarantors in favour of the Secured

Lenders financing the Issuer's vessels Island Frontier and Island Webserver by way of cash

sweeps in the Issuer guaranteed by the Guarantors;

(vi

<<<

)

The parent company guarantees from the Issuer to the Secured Lenders to IO X will be put

on hold during the Restructuring Period but if the vessels in IO X do not generate enough

cash to cover opex, maintenance capex and interest under

<<<

 the Facility Agreements in IO X

and secured Seller's Credits, then the Issuer shall cover the shortfall;

(vii) Separate amendments to the covenants and undertakings of the Issuer and each applicable member of the Group under the respective

<<<

 Facility Agreements including, without limitation, the waiver of all financial covenants save for the minimum liquidity/ free cash covenant1, and the alignment of all information and reporting covenants as per the strictest provisions in the

<<<

 applicable Facility Agreements;

(viii)

No amendments to the interest payment provisions or the security, and any intermediate agreements entered into with any of the Secured Lenders, including PIK payment agreements, to be terminated with

<<<

 retroactive effect from 30 June 2017; and

(ix)

No further drawdowns are to be made under any Facility Agreement, and any undrawn

commitments shall be cancelled with retroactive effect from 30 June 2017; and

1 One exception applies: The

<<<

 amendment agreement for the Secured Debt in IO 111 (owning the vessel Island Constructor) there is a minimum loan to value covenant applicable 24 months from the Effective Date

4/11

(x)

The Issuer shall prior to each quarter make and forward

<<<

 to the Secured Lenders a forward

looking forecast for the next 3 months. If the forecast shows that there will be insufficient

funds to cover opex, maintenance capex, interest and fixed amortisation due under the

Facility Agreement (as amended

<<<

 for the Restructuring Period) and guaranteed payments to

IO X as described in (vi) above in the following quarter, even if some payments are delayed

and after taking into account specific commitments (if any) from Principal Owners to

contribute

<<<

 additional funds (in the form of equity or permitted loans) to remedy such

shortfalls, the Issuer shall notify the Secured Lenders and thereafter only make payments

as described above that are secured and payments that are necessary to protect

<<<

 values.

The Issuer shall at the same time request a stand-still for all other payments, and a

meeting between the Issuer, IO X and the Secured Lenders shall be called.

1.2.3 Equity contribution The Principal Owners and minority shareholders

<<<

 of the Group will contribute in total MNOK 369 in cash as part of the restructurings of the Group out of which MNOK 336 is new equity to the Group and MNOK 33 is contributed by the Principal Owners to IOM to assist IOM in settling amounts due

<<<

 to members of the Group (being IO III and IO XII). Of the MNOK 336 in new equity contributed to the Group, MNOK 250 is contributed in cash by the Principal Owners as new equity to the Issuer. Of the MNOK 250, the Issuer will use MNOK 137 to

<<<

 settle claims for uncalled capital in the partnerships (Nw: kommandittselskaper) forming part of the Group. Together with MNOK 86 from the minority shareholders in these partnerships, all uncalled capital will be paid in (in total MNOK 223

<<<

). Of the remaining MNOK 113 contributed by the Principal Owners as new equity to the Issuer, MNOK 62 shall be used to repay intra-group debt to IOM and MNOK 51 shall remain in the Issuer to improve its working capital.

As of the date of this

<<<

 Summons, the Principal Owners have paid in all uncalled capital to the partnerships by way of a subordinated loan to the Issuer with security in the same partnership shares as the uncalled capital obligation is settled. On implementation of

<<<

 the restructuring of the Issuer, these subordinated loans will be converted to equity in the Issuer. Further, as described above, the minority shareholders' part of the obligation to pay the uncalled capital in the partnerships of the Group

<<<

 amounts to MNOK 86. If and to the extent the minority shareholders failed to make such payments, the Principal Owners guaranteed the payment of such uncalled capital. However, all minority owners have at the date of this Summons fulfilled their

<<<

 payment obligations. Consequently, all MNOK 223 of uncalled capital has been paid to the Norwegian partnerships of the Group.

1.2.4 The Bond Issues As part of the contemplated restructuring of the Issuer and IO X, the Issuer proposes certain

<<<

 amendments to the Bond Agreement, the key terms of which can be summarized as follows:()i

(i)

The Tranche A Maturity Date and the Tranche B Maturity Date shall be extended to 30 June

2021 (the "Final Maturity Date");

5/11

(ii)

In the

<<<

 period between the Date of Agreement and the Final Maturity Date, the cash

interest on the Bonds shall be amended to reflect that from 30 June 2017 and until the

Final Maturity Date, the cash interest on the Bonds is fixed at 1.25% per annum

<<<

;

(iii)

The existing PIK Interest shall continue pursuant to Clause 9.4 (b) of the Bond Agreement,

and no additional payment in kind (PIK) element shall be included;

(iv)

reduction in the number of Interest Payment Dates from four to two

<<<

, amendments to the

call option, reduced financial reporting and deletion of the put option in the event of

change of control; and

(v)

A subordination agreement (the "Subordination Agreement") shall be executed by the

Bond Trustee as bond

<<<

 trustee and security agent under the Bond Agreement and the

Secured Lenders setting out that the Bonds rank after (i) the debt owed to the Secured

Lenders and (ii) the guarantee obligation undertaken by the Issuer pursuant to the terms of

<<<



the secured debt in IO X; and pari passu with the debt to the Lending Suppliers and that

the Bondholders may only act on an Event of Default with the prior written consent of the

Secured Lenders and must accept delayed payments under the

<<<

 Bond Agreement if there are

insufficient funds at any time.

The amendments to the Bond Issue referred to herein will be documented by an amendment and restatement agreement ("Amendment and Restatement Agreement") which has attached to it

<<<

 the amended and restated Bond Agreement ("Amended and Restated Bond Agreement") and the Subordination Agreement. Both agreements are attached to this Summons as Annex 4 (together the "Bond Amendments"). For information purposes, we also enclose

<<<

 as Annex 5 a document showing by way of mark up the changes made to the Amended and Restated Bond Agreement compared to the existing agreement.

In order to give effect to the provision in (ii) above (i.e. that the Bonds shall earn cash interest

<<<

 at the rate of 1.25% per annum from 30 June 2017 and until the Final Maturity Date), the cash amount payable as interest from the Date of Agreement (being the date that the Bond Amendments take effect, see section 1.3 below) will be reduced

<<<

 until the difference between (i) the present Bond Reference Rate (3 months NIBOR) + the Margin (5.25% per annum) actually paid between 30 June 2017 and the Date of Agreement and (ii) the new Fixed Rate (1.25% per annum) has been recovered.

<<<

 The calculation of the amount and the intended schedule for its recovery is set forth in Annex 2 hereto. The calculation set forth in Annex 2 is made on the assumption that the Bond Amendments become effective before the Interest Payment Date

<<<

 that otherwise would occur on 5 January 2018 (i.e. that the Date of Agreement occurs prior to said date). If the Bond Amendments have not become effective on or before 5 January 2018, the Issuer is asking the Bondholders' Meeting to resolve

<<<

 as part of the Proposal (see clause 3 below) to postpone the payment of the cash interest otherwise due on 5 January 2018 until the next Interest Payment Date (i.e. 5 April 2018) and without any compensation for the delayed payment. If the

<<<

 Date of Agreement occurs before 5 April 2018, payment of cash interest on 5 April 2018 will be as per the Bond Amendments (and Annex 2 hereto). If the Date of Agreement has not occurred on or before 5 April 2018, cash interest will be paid

<<<

 as per the Bond Agreement prior to the Bond Amendments (including payment of the postponed cash interest as described herein).

6/11

1.2.5 Lending Suppliers

As part of the contemplated restructuring of the Issuer and IO X, the Issuer and

<<<

 IO X (as the case may be) are required to amend their loan agreements ("Seller's Credits") with the Lending Suppliers. Similar to the Bond Amendments, it is required that the Lending Suppliers accept that they may only act on an event of default

<<<

 under the respective Seller's Credits with the prior written consent of the Secured Lenders and that the Lending Suppliers must accept delayed payments under the Seller's Credits if there are insufficient funds at any time. Unsecured Seller

<<<

's Credits must accept a reduction in cash interest to the same level as for the Bond; i.e. cash interest fixed at 1.25% per annum without any additional PIK interest. As for the Bonds, this reduction in interest will take retroactive effect

<<<

 from 30 June 2017.

No amendments are made to the interest on secured Seller's Credits.

1.2.6 Other initiatives/measures In addition to the above, each applicable member of the Group is required to amend their management agreements with IOM

<<<

 to reflect that IOM cannot terminate the management agreements in the Restructuring Period, and amending the charter parties between the Issuer and IOM to better reflect the back-to-back structure with end clients. Further, IOM will streamline

<<<

 its management services and move ongoing REtD work out of IOM. In connection therewith, IOM will divest (all or some) of its shares in Island Offshore Subsea AS.

The restructuring of the Issuer and IO X provides for (i) the appointment of

<<<

 a supervisory committee in the Issuer, consisting of the four managers of the Issuer and two independent members appointed by the Issuer and approved by the Secured Lenders and (ii) the appointment of an independent member to the board of IOM

<<<

. Finally, the restructuring of the Issuer and IO X requires that the Issuer shall remove or obtain back-to-back guarantees for undertakings by the Issuer to third parties (other than those referred to in section 1.3.2 above).

1.3
