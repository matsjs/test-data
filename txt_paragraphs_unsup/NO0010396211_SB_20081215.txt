 Bond Issue 2007/2009 with Warrants
O slo, 15 D ecem ber 2008
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Amendment of Loan Agreement
1. Background
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issue

<<<

 (the "Loan") where Transeuro Energy Corp ("Transeuro" or the "Company") is the borrower.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the agreement o f the Loan dated 9 November 2007 (the "Loan Agreement") or

<<<

 the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.
The Company has issued bonds totaling USD 15,000,000, (the "Bonds"). The Bonds were issued in USD 1,000 denominations pursuant to the Loan Agreement. Each Bond had attached to

<<<

 it 500 share purchase warrants (the "Warrants") exercisable for a period of two years at a price of NOK 3.40, or approximately CAD 0.60. The Warrants are separately transferable from the Bonds. The Bonds mature two years after the date o f

<<<

 issue and bear interest at a rate of 12%. Interest payments are due each 6 months after the date of issue, with the first payment made in May of 2008. The second interest payment o f USD 919,999.94 was due on 13 November 2008. Unfortunately

<<<

 the Company was not able to meet this payment. However, the Bondholders have granted the Company an extension to the interest payment date to 18 December 2008.
In a press release dated 31 October 2008 the Company informed the Loan Trustee that

<<<

 their joint venture partner Rohol-Aufsuchungs AG ("RAG") gave notice o f withdrawal from the Joint Venture Agreement ("JVA") between Transeuro and RAG dated 14 July 2008 which agreement governs the assets owned and operated by Transeuro in

<<<

 the Ukraine. This action by RAG placed Transeuro in an unexpected preliminary shortfall of cash. At the interest payment date 13 November 2008 (the "Due Date") the Company was therefore not in the position to pay the interest payment amount

The Company summoned for a Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

 on 27 November 2008 and requested for a four week extension of the relevant interest payment by an initial period of four weeks from the date of the Bondholders' meeting, and thereafter the Loan Trustee is given power o f attorney to extend

<<<

 the waiver period on a weekly basis in its own discretion, acting in the best interests of the Bondholders, until 4 January 2008. Default interest shall be calculated on the Remaining Loan as well on the interest payment amount which was due

<<<

 at the Due Date (the "Due Interest Amount") with 17 per cent p.a. from and including the Due Date until the Due Interest Amount plus interest on the Due Interest Amount is paid in full. The Bondholders accepted the request, and it was decided

<<<

 to amend the Loan Agreement pursuant to the summons.
The Company proposes a settlement of the Due Interest Amount plus interest on the Due Interest Amount that are presently due but not paid. The proposal (the "Proposal") will be described

<<<

 in the following.
2. Settlement of outstanding interest payments presently in default
The Proposal is put forward to all Bondholders.
The Proposal is subject to approval from (i) the TSX Venture Exchange (the "Exchange"), and (ii) the Bondholders

<<<

.
2.1 Reduction of exercise price of previously issued warrants
Part o f the Proposal involves reducing the exercise price of all of the common share purchase Warrants that were issued in connection with the Bonds and the Debentures to 50% of

<<<

 the current exercise price. As Transeuro is a company whose primary listing is on the Exchange, the Company is required to comply with Exchange policies when amending the terms of previously issued warrants.
One o f the requirements o f the

<<<

 policies of the Exchange is that when the exercise price o f a warrant is reduced, the warrant must have an early exercise provision built into its new terms.
Section 5.3(b) of Exchange policy 4.1, which policy addresses the amendment of the

<<<

 exercise price of warrants, specifically states that when applying to lower the exercise price of a warrant:
"The terms o f the warrants must be amended to shorten the exercise period to a period o f 30 days if for ten consecutive trading days

<<<

 (the "Premium Trading Days") the closing price o f the Listed Shares exceeds the revised price by the applicable Private Placement discount. The 30 day period will commence seven calendar days after the tenth Premium Trading Day. "
As a result

<<<

, if the exercise price o f the warrants is reduced to 50% o f the current exercise price, all of the newly priced warrants will contain an early exercise clause that will shorten the exercise period in the event that the Company's common shares

<<<

 close over a 25% premium to the new exercise price for a period o f 10 consecutive trading days1.

1If for instance the exercise price of the Warrants is reduced to CAD 0.30 and if the Company's common shares close on the TSXV for a period

<<<

 of 10 consecutive days at a price of CAD 0.375 (0.30 plus 25%, the applicable discount) or greater, then the warrants will expire on the date that is 30 days following the end of the 10 consecutive day period. It has to be 10 consecutive trading

<<<

 days following the date that the warrants are amended.

2.2 Conversion of Interest to Units
The second part of the Proposal is to convert the Due Interest Amount plus interest on the Due Interest Amount into Units of the Company, each

<<<

 Unit will consist of one common share of the Company and one half o f a common share purchase warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable into an additional common share at a price o f CAD 0.15 for a period o f two years ("Unit").
It is proposed

<<<

 to convert into Units o f the Company, all o f the outstanding interest that is due under the Bonds and Series A Debentures, and the interest which will soon be due under the Series B Debentures.
Each Unit would be issued at a deemed price

<<<

 o f CAD 0.10 (i.e. conversion o f Due Interest Amount and interest on the Due Interest Amount into Units will be carried out based on a price o f CAD 0.10 per Unit) and would contain a common share and one-half of a share purchase warrant,

<<<

 with each whole warrant exercisable into an additional common share at a price of CAD 0.15 for a period of two years.
The settlement of debt falls under the debt settlement policies of the Exchange and these policies permit the settlement of

<<<

 outstanding debt with Units of a listed company. The Exchange policies, however, do not permit the settlement of future debt by issuing Units at the current market price of the Company's common shares.
Notwithstanding the Exchanges' Policies

<<<

 on this matter, it is the Company's intention to request that the Exchange permit the Company to settle the remaining two interest payments that are due under each o f the Bonds, and the Series A and B Debentures by the issuance of Units at

<<<

 USD 0.10.
If the Exchange agrees to the settlement of the future interest payments, then a total of approximately CAD 3,600,000 of interest payments would be settled by the issuance of Units. This would result in approximately 36,000,000 common

<<<

 shares and 18,000,000 warrants being issued in connection with the settlement. In addition, the Company has proposed a similar settlement with its Series A and Series B Debenture holders, which, if accepted, would result in approximately CAD

<<<

 1,620,000 of interest payments being settled by the issuance of 16,200,000 common shares and 8,100,000 warrants.
The Company has discussed this matter with the Exchange on a preliminary basis and the Company will use its best efforts to convince

<<<

 the Exchange that, given the current market conditions as well as the financial condition of the Company, the Exchange should allow the Company to settle its future interest payments at the present time by issuing Units o f the Company, at

<<<

 the Company's current market price.
However, if the Exchange will not allow the Company to do what it is requesting, then it would have to apply to the Exchange to allow the Company to settle the future interest payments at the time they become

<<<

 due and become a current debt obligation of the Company. This means that any shares or warrants that are issued in connection with the settlement of these interest payments will have to be issued at a deemed price equal to the market price

<<<

 o f the Company's shares at the time the interest payment is due.
The Company will work to convince the Exchange to agree to the proposed Settlement Terms. If this is not successful, the Company will have to return to the Bondholders with a

<<<

 revised proposal for settlement.
Any questions with respect to the proposed Settlement Terms, please contact Ed Farrauto at +1604681-3939.
