1 BACKGROUND
The Original Issuer is exposed to an increasingly challenging market situation with dramatically low dry bulk charter rates and guarantees

<<<

 granted by the Original Issuer for charters related to certain lease agreements and ship owners.
This has resulted in significant strains on the Original Issuer's short term liquidity situation. Based on the above the Board of Directors of

<<<

 the Original Issuer has, in order to protect the interests of all stakeholders, including the interests of the Original Issuer's creditors and shareholders, considered available options and initiated a process to explore strategic alternatives

<<<

. In doing so the Board is observing its fiduciary obligations and is acting in the best common interest of the Original Issuer and its shareholders as well as its creditors and employees. Pareto Securities has been engaged as financial advisor

<<<

 for the strategic process.
Based on the above, the Original Issuer has on 1 February 2016 executed a sale and purchase agreement (the "SPA") in respect of:

a.

its 100 % owned subsidiary Western Bulk Chartering AS ("WB Chartering"); and
