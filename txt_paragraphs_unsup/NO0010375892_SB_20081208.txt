RESTRUCTURING - SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETINGS

1. BACKGROUND

Norsk

<<<

 Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders of bonds ("the Bonds") in the above mentioned loans ("the Loans") to DP Producer AS ("DPP AS") and FPS Ocean AS ("FPSO AS") with the following details:

1. DPP AS - USD 75 million FRN

<<<

 Callable Bond 2006/11 (ISIN NO 001 034042.5) senior 2. priority bond issued December 5th, 2006 (the "2nd Priority Bond Loan")
2. DPP AS - NOK 210 million FRN Callable Bond 2007/09 (ISIN NO 001 037589.2) unsecured bond issued 24th July 2007

<<<

 (the "Unsecured Bond Loan")
3. FPSO AS - 9% Subordinated Callable Convertible Bond 2008/11 (ISIN NO 001 0417066) - NOK 175 million subordinated convertible bond issued February 21th, 2008 (the "Convertible Bond Loan")

FPSO AS is a holding

<<<

 company and the parent company of FPSOcean Group. DPP AS is a 100% owned subsidiary and owns the `DeeP Producer U conversion project ("DPP1 Project"). The Group consist of three other 100% owned subsidiaries, FPSO Management AS (management

<<<

 company including all employees), DP Offshore AS ("DPO AS")(`DeeP Producer 2' or "DPP2" Project owning company) and Ocean Engineering AS (no assets/activity). References to "FPSOcean" or the "Company" refer to the FPSOcean Group, the group

<<<

 companies together or each of the companies individually as the case may be.

DPP AS is currently converting the MT "Laurita" to a Dynamically Positioned (DP) FPSO to be renamed "DeeP Producer 1" on completion. The conversion takes place at

<<<

 Drydocks World-Dubai ("DWD"). The conversion project was initiated in 2006 based on a new concept for providing a generic FPSO specially designed for deep water well testing and early production capabilities using dynamic positioning and proprietary

<<<

 disconnectable riser buoy technology.

Due to the development nature of this project, both cost and schedule has been revised several times. In addition, capacity constraints among vendors, and more recently at the yard, has caused further delays and cost escalations.
As a result

<<<

, the Company needs to raise additional USD 95 million to complete the DPP1 conversion project and fund operations until "sail away", expected late May 2009. The global financial crisis which escalated dramatically over the last few months has

<<<

 made this exercise impossible without a substantial restructuring of the Company's capital base.
The Company has for 2-3 months been trying to raise the remaining capital needed to complete the "Deep Producer 1" conversion project. These attempts

<<<

 have been conducted on the basis of the current cost base of the project, i.e. no re-structuring of the Company's capital base. Relevant financial and industrial investors have been approached on such basis, without success. Neither has it

<<<

 been possible to raise the money from today's shareholders.
2. PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE LOAN AGREEMENTS
2.1 Rescue proposal summary
The financial solution consists of the following main elements:
Current shareholders willing to commit additional

<<<

 capital at NOK 1 per share; - New equity requirement of USD 70 million from up to four sources; existing
shareholders, 2nd priority bondholders, unsecured bondholders and new investors. Existing shareholders and bondholders will be given preferred

<<<

 allocation; Full equity conversion of approximately USD 61 million of unsecured debt valued at approx. USD 10 million at the proposed issue price for new equity of NOK 1 per share. Unsecured debt includes NOK 210 million (approx. USD 30 million

<<<

) of unsecured bonds, NOK 175 million (approximately USD 25 million) of convertible bonds and USD 6 million of assumed unsecured debt to "Deep Producer 2" creditors; - 2nd priority bond holders with USD 50 million of debt reduction (from USD

<<<

 75 million to USD 25 million). Existing 2nd priority bondholders (on an individual basis) will, at the reduced value of USD 25 million, have the option to either A) maintain their 2nd priority bond, B) convert their bonds to equity at NOK 

<<<

1 per share, or C) convert their bonds into a new (up to USD 25 million) convertible bond; - Existing USD 50 million 1st priority bank loan commitment from lenders to be increased to USD 75 million, already approved by the lead bank's credit

<<<

 committee and board of directors, subject to inter alia approval from GIEK and the "Deep Producer 1" conversion project being fully financed.
The revised capital structure reflects a total capital base of approximately USD 176 million, providing

<<<

 an attractive recovery potential for new money.
Post-transaction equity value will constitute approximately USD 81 million (equalling approximately 45%) of the new capital base, hereunder USD 70 million of new, paid-in
2

equity and approximately

<<<

 USD 11 million of pre-money equity from the conversion of unsecured debt (approx. USD 10 million) and valuation of existing equity at NOK 1 per share (approx. USD 1 million). The remaining USD 95 million will constitute of USD 70 million of

<<<

 1st priority bank debt and approximately USD 25 million of re-structured 2nd priority debt or convertible bond (if not converted to equity at the bondholder's option).
To illustrate the recovery and upside potential based on the re-structured

<<<

 implied asset cost of approx. USD 176 million, the FPS Ocean equity value is approx, twice of its initial value if the DPP1 vessel is re-sold/re-valued at USD 250 million. Such asset value is according to the Company well supported by reduced

<<<

 replacement/equipment costs, estimated at USD 250300 million, as well as supported by potential day rate and earnings levels discussed with potential clients. At full projected USD 335 million cash cost value, it is estimated that the re structured

<<<

 FPS Ocean equity value would nearly triple in value.
For the proposed conversion of existing debt into new FPS Ocean shares, it is calculated that unsecured debt holders on average would obtain an approx. 30% recovery (vs. blended 15% at conversion

<<<

) if the DPP1 vessel is valued at USD 250 million in the future. At USD 335 million value, recovery for unsecured debt holders would on average amount to approx. 45%. Similarly, for 2.pr secured bondholders choosing to convert the re-structured

<<<

 USD 25 million worth of bonds, recovery is estimated at approx. 55%-85% at future DPP1 asset values of USD 250 million and USD 335 million, respectively.
Bondholder's recovery would further improve in these scenarios, if they acquire new shares

<<<

, at NOK 1 per share, in the USD 70 million Private Placement (with preferred allocation to existing shareholders and bondholders).
To preserve available cash during this period of time, the Company is seeking agreements with vendors and lenders

<<<

 to temporary standstill of payments from FPS Ocean AS and its subsidiary DP Producer AS until February 15th 2009. Based on current cash position, strict cash management and voluntary standstill agreements with financial and trade creditors

<<<

, the Company expects to maintain a positive cash position until end of January 2009.
The Company, together with its financial advisor Pareto Securities AS, will work actively to raise the required USD 70 million of equity among the current

<<<

 group of stake-holders as well as targeting new investors. This process will run in parallel with obtaining approvals from the involved bondholder groups and shareholders and preparations for the share issue. The post transaction capital base

<<<

 of approximately USD 175 million, versus the approximately USD 335 million total DPP1 conversion cost, is considered, according to the Company and Pareto Securities AS, to offer a significant upside potential for the re-financed FPSOcean while

<<<

 providing an attractive entry point for new investors. A limited number of key industrial targets have been approached with the described restructuring plan.
The proposed solution will form the basis for continued conversion and a successful

<<<

 pre- and post-delivery financing of "Deep Producer 1". The overall schedule implies mechanical completion estimated by end of January 2009 and "sail away" from the yard expected by late May 2009.
3

Default scenario
According to the Company

<<<

 it is expected that a default would provide a very limited recovery, if any, to existing bondholders. Unless existing bondholders step in, in case of default, to maintain existing contracts and in-house resources - in which case the same amount

<<<

 of USD 70 million of new equity would still be required - the company expects the time and costs to complete the DPP1 conversion project will increase. Consequently, the Company expects capex potentially to increase if re-sold on an "as is

<<<

, where is" basis to a new owner. The implication of this being that current 2.pr secured bondholders would face an uncertain recovery when factoring in the approx. USD 50 million outstanding to the DWD yard plus the estimated USD 95 million

<<<

 of unfunded capex plus any potential increase from halting the project temporarily.
In light of these default scenarios, the Company believes that the proposed re-structuring offers a better value proposition for all stakeholders, both in terms

<<<

 of near term recovery and at completion providing additional recovery potential from converted debt into equity and/or from acquired new shares in the USD 70 million Private Placement at NOK 1 per share.
2.2 Proposed changes to each loan agreement

<<<


The Company proposes the changes below for the respective Loan Agreements. The proposed changes are further elaborated in a company presentation that may be downloaded from: www.siamaata.no or the Company's web page: www.fpsocean.com (go to

<<<

 "Investor Relations/News", open OTC announcement dated 8th December titled "Company Update" and click on Attachment at the bottom of the announcement) and will also be described further on an information meeting to be held on Monday 15th December

<<<

 2008 at 13.00 hours (1 pm) (Oslo time) at the offices of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend this information meeting to notify Norsk Tillitsmann ASA by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at

<<<

4

2.2.1 2nd Priority Bond

<<<

 Loan
The Company proposes that the Bondholders in the 2nd Priority Bond Loan consent to a USD 50 million of debt reduction (from USD 75 million to USD 25 million) to be implemented through a split of each Bond to 100,000 new Bonds with a face

<<<

 value of USD 1 and thereafter cancellation of a number of bonds equal to 66.67% of total bonds. Accrued interest due on December 5, 2008 will be paid on 15 February 2009 together with accrued interest on the cancelled Bonds up to the date of

<<<

 the extraordinary general meeting in FPS Ocean AS approving the share increase enabling the USD 70 million private placement. The Bondholders will have an option (on an individual basis) either to:
(i) Keep their non-cancelled Bonds on terms

<<<

 and conditions of the existing Loan Agreement. Accrued interest on the non-cancelled Bonds will be paid on the interest payment date falling due on 5 March 2009. The interest rate for the Bonds will continue to be LIBOR + 6.0%. The security

<<<

 for the Bonds will be shared on pari passue basis with the new convertible bond set out in item (iii) below.
(ii) Convert their non-cancelled Bonds into shares in FPS Ocean AS at a conversion price of NOK 1 per share converted to USD based

<<<

 on the Norwegian Bank's USD/NOK fixing rate as of the date prior to the date of the extraordinary general meeting in FPS Ocean AS approving the share increase enabling the USD 70 million private placement. Fraction of shares will not be issued

<<<

. Accrued interest on the non-cancelled Bonds shall be written off and no cash or shares will be received by the Bondholders for the interest amount.
(iii) Convert their non-cancelled Bonds into new convertible bonds at a conversion rate of

<<<

 1/1. The new bonds will be convertible into shares in FPS Ocean AS at a conversion price of USD 0.191 per share. Accrued interest on the noncancelled Bonds shall be written off, however the new convertible bond will carry interest from 5 December

<<<

 2008. The interest rate for the new convertible bonds will be 5.0% payable semi-annually. Terms and conditions for the new convertible bonds will be in accordance with standard Norwegian terms and conditions for similar convertible bond issues

<<<

. The new convertible bonds will be pari passu with the 2nd Priority Bond Loan on both status and security, and will otherwise be based on the same structure.
Provided that the Bondholders wish to keep their Bonds or convert their Bonds into

<<<

 new convertible bonds in accordance with item nos. (i) or (iii) above, the Company proposes an increase of the carve-out of the first priority debt from USD 50 million to USD 75 million in order to allow for an increase of the first priority

<<<

 bank loan provided by DVB Group Merchant Bank (Asia) Ltd.
5

The Company further proposes that all interest payments and finance expenses due on or after November 28, 2008 until and including February 14, 2009 are postponed until 15 February

<<<

 2009.
Bondholders who wish to choose option (ii) or (iii) above must contact your broker contact at Pareto Securities AS (or Atle Sigmundstad + 47 22 87 87 75/22 87 87 00) within 16:00 (4 pm Oslo time) on 22 December 2008, otherwise option

<<<

 (i) will be the selected solution.
2.2.2 Unsecured Bond Loan
The Company proposes that the Bondholders consent to a NOK 172 million of debt reduction (from NOK 210 million to NOK 38 million) with a subsequent conversion of all Bonds into shares

<<<

 of FPS Ocean AS at a price of NOK 1 per share. Fraction of shares will not be issued. Accrued interest on the Unsecured Bond Loan shall be written off (including interest payment falling due on 24 January 2009) and no cash or shares will be

<<<

 received by the Bondholders for the interest amount.
2.2.3 Convertible Bond Loan
The Company proposes that the Bondholders consent to a NOK 152 million of debt reduction (from NOK 175 million to NOK 23 million) with a subsequent conversion

<<<

 of all Bonds into shares of FPS Ocean AS at a price of NOK 1 per share. Fraction of shares will not be issued. Accrued interest on the Convertible Bond Loan shall be written off and no cash or shares will be received by the Bondholders for

<<<

 the interest amount.
3. COMPANY INFORMATION
3.1 DPP AS/DPP1 project status
The original cost estimate as of Dec 2006 of USD 180 million with planned completion by end of 2007 was revised to USD 209 million as of May 2007 and subsequently to

<<<

 USD 240 million as of November 2007 and then to USD 250 million as of April 2008 with planned completion/sail away by end of Q3 2008. During early fall 2008 it became clear that the schedule was unrealistic and the cost was later revised to

<<<

 USD 335 million based on a new schedule with mechanical completion expected by end of January 2009 and sail away in late May 2009.
These cost escalations are mainly due to further changes of design and upgrading of technical specifications

<<<

 during the conversion project, underestimations of equipment and engineering supplies, increasing suppliers' costs, a fragmented contracting strategy, lack of sufficient capable resources as well as a substantial prolongation of the project

<<<

 schedule.
The above final schedule and cost are the result of a detailed review of all remaining work packages and deliveries by a 14 member task force including internal and external
6

experienced personnel as well as individual negotiations

<<<

 with key suppliers and the yard, DWD.
The yard contract has been renegotiated to include a lump sum and a defined schedule with a bonus and penalty mechanism designed to meet the estimated mechanical complete date. The contract amendment also

<<<

 provides revised plans, organization and reporting processes to significantly improve control of project progress and quality. The Company has provided offers to DWD for additional skilled workers to improve capacity and progress at the yard

<<<

. Key supplier contracts are being renegotiated to include a high level of commitment to deliver remaining scope within an agreed timeframe and costs.
The task force also reviewed actual status in September of remaining engineering work and

<<<

 purchasing activity. Actions were taken to ensure timely completion of this work and coordinated deliverables with a revised overall construction schedule. This revised plan was agreed with DWD and manpower to execute work was committed. The

<<<

 revised plan has a more detailed area and discipline break down which enable substantially improved progress control as well as ability to refocus on open work fronts.
The project team has been changed with new project manager and cost controller

<<<

. Additional resources have been engaged in engineering, follow up of class approvals, supervision and mechanical completion inspections.
Revised reporting and management routines include weekly reports on progress, weekly project meetings and

<<<

 bi weekly DWD/FPSOcean senior management meetings.
The "DeeP Producer 1" conversion is currently approximately 89% complete, in line with current schedule and within the approved cost estimate. All major equipment is already at site, except

<<<

 the dis-connectable buoy and thrusters which are expected to arrive in February 2009. Remaining scope of work is essentially related to completion of electrical and instrumentation work, completion of living quarters, some piping installations

<<<

 and commissioning/sea trials.
The latest weekly project report to management gives a average weekly progress since end of September 2008 of approximately 1.1 %. This is in line with the planned schedule both in terms of total and weekly progress

<<<

. Engineering progress is 86% of total, approximately 16.000 hours is yet to be completed. This includes 5,500 hours of follow up engineering and operations documentations. Substantially all equipment has been ordered and delivered to site.

<<<

 Only 13 purchase orders (Pos) for minor standard equipment (estimated 2% value of total purchase volume) remains outstanding of a total of 223 Pos.
Conversion progress of approximately 89% is measured on discipline level and is approximately

<<<

 97.7% for steel activity, 83.5% for piping and app 62.4% for electrical/instrumentation (el/instr). Remaining work on piping and el/instr is measured on itemized details and counted down.
7

The revised approved cost-estimate to complete the

<<<

 project is USD 335 million and includes all elements i.e. vessel, equipment, engineering, project management, vessel conversion, finance, overhead and contingency. All project and management costs to end May 2009 are included. No deviation

<<<

 to approved budget has been reported to end of November.
A total of USD 196 million has been paid to date. The remaining financing requirement of USD 140 million will be financed with USD 70 million of equity and USD 70 million of first priority

<<<

 debt.
Please look at the below table for a complete overview of the budget as of end October 2008 and updated forecast, together with an outline of committed, paid and unpaid capital to date. In the right column, you will also see what has

<<<

 been capitalized (accrued) to date, reflecting project progress.
On the bottom of the table, please find an overview of the implied write-down of the capital structure and current cash position. The Company currently has a cash reserve of approximately

<<<

 USD 6 million. Strict cash management and standstill agreements with creditors are aimed at preserving cash to the end of January 2009.

The Company has requested a payment standstill for payments of interest expense and finance cost to all financial creditors to DPP AS and FPSO AS from November 28, 2008 until

<<<

 February 15, 2009. NTM has granted such standstill on behalf of the 2nd Priority Bond Loan, the Unsecured Bond Loan and the Convertible Bond Loan until respective Bondholder meetings have voted over the issue (within a reasonable time).
Similarly

<<<

, the Company has requested a payment standstill from all trade creditors to DPP AS and FPSO AS and is in the process of agreeing voluntary standstill agreements for outstanding payments as of November 28, 2008 until February 15, 2009. The Company

<<<

 will comply with relevant law and exercise such arrangements in consultation with legal counsel. In order to avoid a complete temporary stop in the DPP1 conversion progress and to minimize impact on project schedule, the Company may have to

<<<

 pay some vendors in advance to secure delivery of critical components or services. The Company is seeking to minimize such payments in order to preserve and stretch current cash as long as possible and until receipt of settlement proceeds from

<<<

 the contemplated share issue forming part of this restructuring plan, expected by late January/early February 2009.
Major DPP1 vendors include DWD (conversion work), Scana (equipments), Lamprell (equipments), Siemens O&G (engineering), Solas

<<<

/Autronica (equipments), Marsh (insurances), Schottel (equipments), Inocean (engineering), GLS (logistics), Draka (equipments) and various consultants at site with a total remaining payments of approximately USD 95 million to complete the project

<<<

, of which DWD accounts for approximately USD 60 million (including defined procurements).
Final lump-sum for DWD conversion scope is USD 51 million. A bonus of USD 3 million may be paid if milestones are achieved. In addition we expect minor

<<<

 variations yet to be approved, but allowance is made in the total estimate to complete. DWD has been paid a 10% down payment of original estimated price (app USD 2.3 million). There are two outstanding payment milestones, a) 40% of the price

<<<

 30 days prior to the date on which parties reasonably expect that the works will be mechanically completed (app USD 23.1 million in early January 2009) and b) 50% of the price plus any accrued bonuses upon delivery of the vessel (before bonuses

<<<

 app USD 25.5 million in medio February 2009).
In case of failure of FPSOcean to make payments, DWD is entitled to complete or not complete the works as it deems fit, and to offer the vessel for sale by public auction or by private sale. Owners

<<<

/creditors will receive excess of sales price after DWD has been compensated for all expenses and cost for work completed.
3.2 DPO AS/DPP2 project status
The above proposed solution includes activities to terminate the "Deep Producer 2" conversion

<<<

 project. Such liquidation may include the sale of the Aframax tanker "Semakau" and all equipments (turbines, thrusters, etc.) and is expected to lead to an unsecured claim on FPS Ocean AS as a result of current guarantees provided by FPS Ocean

<<<

 AS to financial creditors to its DPP2 subsidiary covering the anticipated (net) negative liquidation value of
9

the DPP2 project, which, in this proposal, is included as unsecured debt of USD 6 million in the debt to equity conversion. This

<<<

 proposal is subject to DPO secured creditors' approval. Following termination, FPS Ocean AS will have no further financial or operational commitments from the "Deep Producer 2" conversion project.
The Company is in the process of selling the

<<<

 contract for the two gas turbines which will repay the bank financing and provide some cash to DP Offshore AS. A letter of intent has been executed and final agreements are in preparation with the aim to settle the transaction by Mid December

<<<

. Further, MT `Semakau' including concept designs has been circulated for sale. The Company is also evaluating opportunities for the thrusters.
3.3 General
Following the appointment of Einar Saunes as new CEO, several adjustments have been made

<<<

 to the organization, including hiring additional people for critical project engineering, construction and commissioning activities as well as project management and cost control. In addition, reporting lines and work processes have been adjusted

<<<

 to increase focus on conversion progress and cost control.
Management is also in the process of implementing certain cost reduction actions, including optimizing the work force in Oslo as well as on site in Dubai.
The Company took substantial

<<<

 write offs in its 3rd Quarter accounts including USD 30 million in DPP AS on the DPP1 project and USD 19.7 million in DPO AS on the DPP2 project. Net equity in FPSO AS and DPP AS as of 30th September 2008 was USD 96.1 million and USD 44.8 million

<<<

 respectively. Net equity on a Group consolidated basis was USD 26.5 million, equal to 10.4% of total consolidated assets.
Group cash balance on Dec 1 was approximately USD 7.6 million. The Company's overall bum rate (including payroll, site

<<<

 team, operational expenses, but excluding financing cost and vendor payments) is about USD 2.0 million per month. In addition, the Company expect to pay certain vendors for future services to maintain a minimum momentum in conversion progress

<<<

 at site. The objective is to reduce cash spending while maintaining satisfactory progress on the DPP1 project as well as continue to market the vessel to prospective clients. So far agreements with eight hired consultants have been terminated

<<<

. One employee has resigned. Further planned reduction in December is three to five consultants. Travelling has been reduced to a minimum. Effect of cost savings is approximately USD 185,000 per month from mid December and increasing through

<<<

 January to an estimated total USD 285,000 per month.
Deep Producer 1 has been marketed to prospective clients for some time. Several oil companies have expressed an interest and DeeP Producer 1 has been evaluated for several future specific

<<<

 field developments.
10

Management is currently in detailed dialogue with two clients for future employment of `DeeP Producer 1' with identified contract opportunities for planned start up during late 2009 or early 2010. One project is being

<<<

 tendered to a major European oil company for employment in South East Asia. FPSOcean is pre-qualified and preliminary technical offer and details were submitted in late November. Prices, final technical specifications and contract conditions

<<<

 are planned to be submitted in January. Contract negotiations are possible in February/March and, if successful, field installation in early 2010. The other prospect opportunity is for a national oil company in Latin America. Technical details

<<<

 have been submitted and `DeeP Producer 1' is technically accepted. The oil company is currently evaluating options for early well testing vessels and have indicated that a decision will soon be made. If successful, negotiations may commence

<<<

 and a contract is possible during IQ 2009 and field installation in 4Q 2009.
An additional eight other prospect opportunities have been identified and are being pursued as back up in the event the above mentioned prospects are not concluded

<<<

 favourably. The Company has made presentations and held discussions with each of these prospective clients. The preliminary schedules indicate possible agreements during the first half of 2009.
For more detailed information, please contact

<<<

 Pareto Securities AS (att Atle Sigmundstad + 47 22878775 / 22878700).
To enable FPS Ocean AS and DP Producer AS to conduct the proposed financial restructuring they have requested NTM to summon Bondholders' meetings to consider the approval
