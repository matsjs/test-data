IMPORTANT NOTICES

Restrictions on marketing and sales to retail investors
The

<<<

 Notes are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors. In some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws, regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale

<<<

 of securities such as the Notes to retail investors.

In particular, in June 2015, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") published the Product Intervention (Contingent Convertible Instruments and Mutual Society Shares) Instrument 

<<<

2015 (the "PI Instrument"), which took effect on 1 October 2015. Under the rules set out in the PI Instrument (as amended or replaced from time to time, the "PI Rules"):

(i)

certain contingent write-down or convertible securities (including

<<<

 any beneficial interests therein), such

as securities having features substantially similar to the Notes, must not be sold to retail clients in the

European Economic Area (the "EEA"); and

(ii) there must not be any communication or approval

<<<

 of an invitation or inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite such securities (or the beneficial interest in such securities) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be

<<<

 received by a retail client in the EEA (in each case, within the meaning of the PI Rules), other than in accordance with the limited exemptions set out in the PI Rules.

The Joint Lead Managers are required to comply with the PI Rules. By purchasing

<<<

, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes (or the beneficial interest in such Notes) from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers, each prospective investor represents, warrants, agrees with, and undertakes to, the Issuer and

<<<

 the Joint Lead Managers that:

(a) it is not a retail client in the EEA (as defined in the PI Rules);

(b) whether or not it is subject to the PI Rules, it will not (i) sell or offer the Notes (or any beneficial interest therein) to retail

<<<

 clients in the EEA, or (ii) communicate (including the distribution of this Prospectus) or approve an invitation or inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) where that invitation or

<<<

 inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the PI Rules), other than (A) in relation to any sale or offer to sell Notes (or any

<<<

 beneficial interest therein) to a retail client in or resident in the United Kingdom (the "UK"), in circumstances that do not and will not give rise to a contravention of the PI Rules by any person and/or (B) in relation to any sale or offer

<<<

 to sell Notes (or any beneficial interest therein) to a retail client in any EEA member state other than the UK, where (x) it has conducted an assessment and concluded that the relevant retail client understands the risks of an investment in

<<<

 the Notes (or such beneficial interests therein) and is able to bear the potential losses involved in an investment in the Notes and (y) it has at all times acted in relation to such sale or offer in compliance with the Markets in Financial

<<<

 Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) ("MiFID") to the extent it applies to it or, to the extent MiFID does not apply to it, in a manner which would be in compliance with MiFID if it were to apply to it; and

(c) it will at all times comply with

<<<

 all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside the EEA) relating to the promotion, offering, distribution and/or sale of the Notes, including (without limitation) any such laws, regulations and regulatory

<<<

 guidance relating to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) by investors in any relevant jurisdiction.

Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed

<<<

 client when purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers, the foregoing representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings will

<<<

 be given by and be binding upon both the agent and its underlying client. Investment in the Notes may be considered by eligible investors who are in a position to give the above representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings and to

<<<

 be able to satisfy themselves that the Notes would constitute an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless it has the expertise (either alone or

<<<

 with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment

<<<

 portfolio.

For the purposes of determining whether a Trigger Event has occurred, the Issuer will (i) calculate the CET1 ratios of the Issuer and the SBAB Consolidated Situation based on information (whether or not published) available to management of

 the Issuer, including information internally reported within the Issuer pursuant to its procedures for ensuring effective ongoing monitoring of the capital ratios of the Issuer and the SBAB Consolidated Situation and (ii) calculate and publish

RISK FACTORS
The Issuer believes that thefollowingfactors may affect its ability tofulfil its obligations under

<<<

 the Notes. Most o f thesefactors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring.
In addition, factors which the Issuer believes may be

<<<

 material for the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are also described below.
The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer

<<<

 may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it or which it may not currently

<<<

 be able to anticipate. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference, and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision

<<<

. The Issuer does not represent that the statements below regarding the risks are exhaustive.
Words and expressions defined in the Conditions or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same meanings in this section.
RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER

<<<


Economic and business risks
Risks relating to the Kingdom of Sweden
Financial instruments issued by the Kingdom of Sweden are rated "Aaa" (long-term) and "P-1" (short term) by Moody's and "AAA" (long-term) and "A-1+" (short-term) by S&P as

<<<

 at the date of this Prospectus. Strong public finances and a competitive export sector, combined with a well-educated labour force and a high standard of living, are circumstances that support the creditworthiness of Sweden. High tax rates

<<<

, rigidities in labour and product markets and high unemployment are factors that may negatively influence the creditworthiness of Sweden. Further, Sweden may also be negatively affected by disruptions in the global economy and financial markets

<<<

. Although Sweden has an ageing population, already implemented pension system reforms are considered to help insulate costs related thereto from the rest of the state finances. As the Issuer conducts all of its business activities in Sweden

<<<

, the Issuer's financial performance is significantly influenced by the general economic conditions of Sweden. Any sustained decline in the general economic conditions of Sweden may have an adverse effect on the Issuer's business, financial

<<<

 condition and/or results of operations.
Risks relating to the Swedish mortgage market
The Swedish mortgage market is dominated by a few institutions, consisting of banks, such as SBAB, and bank-owned mortgage companies. Low interest rates,

<<<

 low inflation, rising house prices and strong increases in disposable household income have led to continued strong growth in demand for loans, especially in the residential mortgage market. One of the main risks related to the Swedish residential

<<<

 mortgage market is the credit risk associated with borrowers' creditworthiness, and their ability to pay under the mortgage loan, and with the value of the mortgaged properties. The relatively low risk profile among Swedish mortgage institutions

<<<

 reflects a high degree of lending to single-family homes, moderate loan-to-value ratios, moderate lending standards and a relatively strong repayment incentive among borrowers. The housing market has been strong for many years driven by low

<<<

 interest rates, low supply of new homes in growth regions and growth in population. House prices may be negatively affected should, for example, the interest rates or the unemployment level rise quickly.
Risks relating to disruptions in the

<<<

 global credit markets and economy
Financial markets are subject to periods of volatility, which may impact the Issuer's ability to raise debt in a similar manner, and at a similar cost, to the funding raised in the past. Challenging market

<<<

 conditions may result in greater volatility and reduced liquidity, widening of credit spreads and lack of price transparency in credit markets, which may affect the Issuer. These conditions and changes in financial markets, including changes

<<<

 in interest rates, exchange rates and returns from equity, property and other investments, may affect the financial performance of the Issuer. In addition, the financial performance of
11

the Issuer could be adversely affected by a worsening

<<<

 of general economic conditions or political climate in the markets and regions in which it operates.
Systemic risk
Due to the high level of interdependence between financial institutions, the Issuer is subject to the risk of deterioration of

<<<

 the actual or perceived commercial and financial soundness of other financial institutions and a default or financial difficulties of one financial institution may have negative consequences for other financial institutions and may lead to

<<<

 liquidity problems, losses, defaults or worsening of general economic climate in the markets in which the Issuer operates.
Risks relating to the Issuer's Business
As a result of its business activities, the Issuer is exposed to a variety of

<<<

 risks, the most significant of which are credit risk, market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk and compliance risk. Failure to control these risks can result in material adverse effects on the Issuer's financial performance and reputation

<<<

.
Further, the Issuer's business could also be affected by competition and other factors such as general economic and business conditions, including changes in the economic climate, both nationally and internationally, changes regarding taxation

<<<

, interest rate developments, inflation, political changes, regulatory changes and changes in the financial markets.
Credit risk
Risks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties

<<<

 are inherent in the business of the Issuer. Adverse changes in the credit quality of the Issuer's borrowers and counterparties due to, for example, a general deterioration in the Swedish, European or global economic conditions, or arising from

<<<

 systemic risks in the financial systems, could affect the recoverability and value of its assets and require an increase in the Issuer's provision for bad and doubtful debts and other provisions.
Market risk
The most significant market risks

<<<

 the Issuer faces are interest rate, foreign exchange and bond price risks. Changes in interest rate levels, yield curves and spreads may affect the interest rate margin realised between lending and borrowing costs. Changes in currency rates

<<<

 affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and may affect income from foreign exchange. Certain currency risks can arise due to mismatch in interest rate flows. Against this background, a liquid derivative

<<<

 market enabling the Issuer to swap foreign currencies is essential. Further, the performance of financial markets may cause changes in the value of the Issuer's liquidity portfolio.
It is difficult to predict with accuracy changes in economic

<<<

 or market conditions and to anticipate the effects that such changes could have on the Issuer's financial performance and business operations.
Operational risk
The Issuer's business is dependent on the ability to process a very large number

<<<

 of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risk and losses can result from fraud or other external or internal crime, errors by employees, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorisation, failure

<<<

 to comply with regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules, equipment failures, natural disasters or the failure of internal or external systems, for example, those of the Issuer's suppliers or counterparties.
Notwithstanding anything

<<<

 in this risk factor, this risk factor should not be taken as implying that the Issuer will be unable to comply with its obligations as a company with securities admitted to the Official List or as a supervised firm regulated by the SFSA.
Liquidity

<<<

 risk
The inability of a financial institution, including the Issuer, to anticipate and provide for unforeseen decreases or changes in funding sources could have consequences on such institution's ability to meet its payment obligations when

<<<

 they fall due and could result in an investor not being paid in a timely manner.
12

As part of its funding, the Issuer accepts deposits from the general public, the majority of which are repayable on demand and which may have an impact on

<<<

 the liquidity of the Issuer. Furthermore, if the Issuer's inability to meet its payment obligations when they fall due is not temporary, it could mean that the Issuer might be considered insolvent.
The Issuer is also subject to liquidity requirements

<<<

 in its capacity as a credit institution supervised by the SFSA, including a statutory requirement to maintain sufficient liquidity to enable it to discharge its obligations as they fall due. The SFSA has issued regulations on liquidity (including

<<<

 Sw. FFFS 2010:7, FFFS 2012:6 and FFFS 2014:12). Serious or systematic deviations from such regulations may lead to the SFSA determining that the Issuer's business does not satisfy the statutory soundness requirement for credit institutions

<<<

 and could result in the SFSA imposing sanctions against the Issuer.
No access to equity capital markets
Since the Issuer's shares are not listed, it does not have direct access to the equity capital markets, and as a consequence, the Issuer

<<<

 is partly dependent upon its owner (the Kingdom of Sweden) as a source for equity capital. If the owner does not provide the Issuer with equity capital to the extent the Issuer needs, this can have a negative impact on the Issuer's business

<<<

. However, it may be noted that the Issuer has access to the debt capital markets.
The Issuer's guidelines and policies for risk management may prove to be inadequate with respect to unidentified and unforeseen risks
The management of business

<<<

, regulatory and legal risks requires, among other things, guidelines and policies for the accurate registration and control of a large number of transactions and events. Such guidelines and policies may not always be adequate. Some methods

<<<

 used by the Issuer to estimate, measure and manage risk are based on perceived historic market behaviour and may therefore prove to be inadequate for predicting future risk exposure. Other methods for risk management are based on evaluation

<<<

 of information regarding markets, customers or other information that is publicly known or otherwise available to the Issuer. Such information has not always been and may not always be accurate or correctly evaluated or a reliable indicator

<<<

 of default and may therefore be inadequate for the purpose of risk management, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's financial condition and results of operations.
The loss o f key personnel may adversely affect the

<<<

 Issuer's performance
The Issuer's performance is dependent on the talent, experience and commitments of highly skilled individuals. The Issuer's ability to compete effectively in its businesses depends on its ability to retain and motivate

<<<

 its existing employees and, where necessary, also recruit skilled employees. Competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry for qualified employees is intense and an inability

<<<

 to keep and if necessary recruit skilled personnel might have adverse effect on the financial performance of the Issuer.
The Issuer is subject to the risk o ffailure or interruption to its IT and other systems
The Issuer's business is dependent

<<<

 on the ability to keep a large amount of customer information and to process a large number of transactions as well as on internal and external systems for its loan distribution. Disruptions in the Issuer's IT or other systems may have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on the Issuer's ability to conduct its business and furthermore its financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, any breach in security of the Issuer's IT systems, for example, from increasingly sophisticated attacks

<<<

 by cybercrime groups, could disrupt its business, result in the disclosure of confidential information and/or create significant financial and/or legal exposure and the possibility of damage to the Issuer's reputation and/or brand.
Subordinatedfunding

<<<

 to SCBC
As a part of the Issuer's activities, the Issuer sells mortgage loans to its subsidiary AB Sveriges Säkerställda Obligationer (publ) (with the parallel trade name The Swedish Covered Bond Corporation) ("SCBC"). The Issuer's claims for

<<<

 the purchase price of the mortgage loans acquired by SCBC are (fully or partially) repaid concurrently with the issue of covered bonds by SCBC. The Issuer's claims in relation to such sales, as well as other claims (unless arising under any

<<<

 derivative agreement entered into pursuant
13

to the Swedish Covered Bonds Issuance Act (Sw. Lag (2003:1223) om utgivning av säkerställda obligationer)) e.g. claims under a revolving credit facility agreement between the Issuer as lender

<<<

 and SCBC as borrower, are subordinated to all unsubordinated claims against SCBC in SCBC's bankruptcy or liquidation. Thus, if SCBC becomes bankrupt or is liquidated or if SCBC is unable to issue covered bonds, the Issuer may have outstanding

<<<

 subordinated claims against SCBC and may not get fully repaid or repaid in a timely manner. See "Description o f the Issuer - The Swedish Covered Bond Corporation" for more information relating to SCBC.
The Issuer's funding costs and its access

<<<

 to the debt capital markets depend significantly on its credit ratings
Any downgrade of the Issuer's credit ratings, or the credit ratings of its significant subsidiaries such as SCBC, could increase its borrowing costs, adversely affect the

<<<

 liquidity position of the Issuer, limit its access to the capital markets, undermine confidence in (and the competitive position of) the Issuer, trigger obligations under certain bilateral terms in some of its trading and collateralised financing

<<<

 contracts (including requiring the provision of additional collateral or the replacement of the Issuer with another counterparty) and/or limit the range of counterparties willing to enter into transactions with the Issuer. Any of the events

<<<

 above could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's business and results of operations.
The Notes are obligations of the Issuer only
The Notes will be solely obligations of the Issuer and will not be obligations of, or guaranteed by

<<<

, any other entities. In particular, the Notes will not be obligations of, and will not be guaranteed by, the Kingdom of Sweden, SCBC or any other entity in the SBAB Group. No liability whatsoever in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay

<<<

 any amount due under the Notes shall be accepted by any of the Kingdom of Sweden, SCBC or any other entity in the SBAB Group.
Impact of legal and regulatory changes
The Issuer's business is subject to regulation and regulatory supervision pursuant

<<<

 to directives, laws, regulations and policies issued by inter alia the European Union (EU) and the Kingdom of Sweden in each location in which the Issuer operates. Any significant legal or regulatory developments could have an effect on how

<<<

 the Issuer conducts its business and on the Issuer's results of operations. This supervision and regulation, in particular in the EU and the Kingdom of Sweden, if changed, could materially affect the Issuer's business, the products and services

<<<

 it offers or the value of its assets. In the aftermath of the global economic crisis, many initiatives for regulatory changes have been taken and the impact of such initiatives is still difficult to predict in full.
Increased capital requirements

<<<

 and standards
Regulation and supervision of the global financial system remains a priority for governments and supranational organisations. Since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 and the increased loan losses and asset quality

<<<

 impairment suffered by financial institutions as a result, governments in some European countries (including Sweden) have increased, or have announced that they are likely to increase, the minimum capital requirements for credit institutions

<<<

 domiciled in these countries over and above the increased capital requirements of Basel III and the CRD IV proposal discussed below.
At the international level, a number of initiatives are being implemented which increase capital requirements

<<<

, increase the quantity and quality of capital and raise liquidity levels in the financial institutions sector. Among these are a number of specific measures proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") and

<<<

 implemented by the European Union to tighten regulations.
The Basel Committee issued a comprehensive set of reform measures in December 2010 ("Basel III"). In addition, on 13 January 2011, the Basel Committee published the minimum requirements

<<<

 for regulatory capital to ensure loss absorbency at the point of non-viability (the "January 2011 release", and together with the Basel III, the "Basel III Framework"). The aim of the Basel III Framework is to improve the ability of credit

<<<

 institutions to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, improve risk management and governance and strengthen credit institutions' transparency and disclosures. The Basel III Framework is intended to raise both the quality

<<<

 and quantity of the capital base and increases capital
14

requirements for certain exposures. The minimum requirements for capital are to be underpinned by a leverage ratio that serves as a backstop to the risk-based capital measures. In

<<<

 addition to the minimum requirements, there are additional buffer requirements as set out in more detail below, which may be on a global, European or domestic basis. The Basel III Framework also introduces internationally harmonised minimum

<<<

 requirements for liquidity risk. The regulatory framework will continue to evolve and any resulting changes could have a material impact on SBAB's business.
Following the Basel III Framework, the European Commission published on 20 July 20

<<<

11 the corresponding proposed changes at the EU level to replace the amended Capital Requirements Directive (2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC) with two legislative instruments: a directly applicable European Parliament and Council Regulation (Regulation

<<<

 (EU) No. 575/2013) establishing the prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (known as the Capital Requirements Regulation or the "CRD IV Regulation") and a European Council Directive (Directive 2013/36/EU) (through

<<<

 an amendment of Directive 2002/87/EC) governing access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms (known as the "CRD IV Directive", together with the CRD IV Regulation,

<<<

 "CRD IV"). The CRD IV Regulation has been directly effective in Sweden since 1 January 2014, while the CRD IV Directive was implemented in Sweden on 2 August 2014 by amendments to existing Swedish legislation and the enactment of new Swedish

<<<

 legislation and regulations of the SFSA. CRD IV is to be supported by a set of binding technical standards currently being developed by the European Banking Authority (the "EBA"). The new EU regulatory framework is broadly in line with the

<<<

 Basel III capital and liquidity standards.
CRD IV permits a transitional period for certain of the enhanced capital requirements and certain other measures. The Swedish authorities, however, generally implemented the higher capital requirements

<<<

 resulting from the implementation of CRD IV without any phasing-in period, or with the shortest permitted phasing-in period, primarily through the Swedish Supervision of Credit and Investment Institutions Act (Sw. Lag (2014:968) om särskild

<<<

 tillsyn över kreditinstitut och värdepappersbolag), the Swedish Act on Capital Buffers (Sw. Lag (2014:966) om kapitalbuffertar) and certain regulations from the SFSA (Sw. FFFS 2014:12 om tillsynskrav och kapitalbuffertar and FFFS 2014:33 om

<<<

 kontracykliskt buffertvärde ("FFFS 2014:33")). As regards capital instruments issued prior to the implementation of CRD IV, the SFSA has allowed longer phase-in periods than the minimum allowed in Article 486 of the CRD IV Regulation and a

<<<

 proportion of the capital instruments specified in FFFS 2013:27 can thus be included in own funds during a transition period.
The changes to the capital adequacy framework include stricter minimum capital requirements for the components in

<<<

 the capital base with the highest quality: common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital must be at least 4.5 per cent. of risk weighted assets at all times and tier 1 capital 6.0 per cent. The minimum total capital (or 'own funds') requirement (tier

<<<

 1 capital plus tier 2 capital) is 8.0 per cent. of risk exposure amount. In addition to the minimum capital requirements, CRD IV introduces further capital buffer requirements that are required to be satisfied with CET1 capital. It will introduce

<<<

 five new capital buffers: (i) the capital conservation buffer, (ii) the countercyclical buffer, (iii) the global systemically important institutions buffer, (iv) the other systemically important institutions buffer, and (v) the systemic risk

<<<

 buffer. Certain of these buffers may be applicable to SBAB as determined by the SFSA. Breach of the combined buffer requirements will result in restrictions on certain capital distributions from the bank, for example, dividend and coupon payments

<<<

 on CET1 and tier 1 capital instruments (see "Interest payments on the Notes may be cancelled by the Issuer (in whole or in part) at any time and, in certain circumstances, the Issuer will be required to cancel such interest payments" and "CRD

<<<

 IV introduces capital requirements that are in addition to the minimum capital ratio" below). In a decision dated 12 October 2015, the SFSA designated systemically important institutions in Sweden. According to the decision, SBAB was not designated

<<<

 a systemically important institution and is thus not subject to the buffer requirement for systemically important institutions. SBAB is also not subject to the systemic risk buffer requirements. There can, however, be no assurance that SBAB

<<<

 will not be designated a systemically important institution or subject to systemic risk buffer requirements in the future.
In connection with the ongoing tightening of capital requirements for Swedish banks, on 8 September 2014, the SFSA published

<<<

 its regulation in relation to countercyclical capital buffers (FFFS: 2014:33). The buffer is a capital requirement which varies over time and is to be used to support credit supply in adverse market conditions. The regulation established a

<<<

 countercyclical capital buffer of 1 per cent. which was to be applied as of 13 September 2015. On 22 June 2015, the SFSA resolved that the countercyclical capital buffer for Sweden would be increased and that the rate would be raised to 1.

<<<

5 per cent. with effect from 27 June 2016 and on 14 March 2016, the SFSA resolved that the countercyclical capital buffer for
15

Sweden would be further increased and that the rate would be raised to 2 per cent. with effect from 19 March 

<<<

2017. In addition, the risk weight floor for Swedish mortgages, initially introduced in May 2013 in the context of the supervisory capital assessment under Pillar 2, was increased to 25 per cent. in September 2014. Such measures and any other

<<<

 changes in the risk weighting of assets may cause reductions in the capital adequacy ratios and solvency levels of SBAB and/or cause the applicable minimum capital requirements to increase.
On 11 May 2015, the SFSA published a memorandum dated

<<<

 8 May 2015 describing the methods it plans to use to evaluate the capital requirements as regards the three most important risk types within other Pillar 2 requirements for all major Swedish banks, namely credit-related concentration risk,

<<<

 interest rate risk in the banking book and pension risk. The SFSA has applied these methods in the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) 2015. The results of the SREP are made public quarterly by the SFSA. There can be no assurance

<<<

 that these methods will not change over time. The SFSA may also introduce additional methods for assessment of Pillar 2 risks. On 1 March 2016, the SFSA issued for consultation new standards for assessing models applied for calculating the

<<<

 capital requirement for credit risk, primarily for corporate exposures. These methods may increase SBAB's capital requirements for credit risk, primarily for the corporate exposures. On 1 March 2016, the SFSA also issued for consultation new

<<<

 pillar 2 requirements for banks applying the advanced internal ratings based approach (A-IRB) for calculating credit risk. SBAB does not currently apply the A-IRB method and is thus not subject to additional pillar 2 requirements due to the

<<<

 proposed method.
The conditions of SBAB's businesses as well as external conditions are constantly changing and the full set of capital adequacy rules applicable to Swedish financial institutions continues to evolve. For the foregoing reasons

<<<

, SBAB may need to raise additional capital in the future. Such capital, whether in the form of debt financing, hybrid capital or additional equity, may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. SBAB is unable to predict what regulatory

<<<

 requirements may be imposed in the future or accurately estimate the impact that any currently proposed regulatory changes may have on its business, the products and services that it offers and the values of its assets. For example, if SBAB

<<<

 is required to make additional provisions, increase its reserves or capital, or exit or change its approach to certain businesses as a result of the initiatives to strengthen the regulation of credit institutions, this could adversely affect

<<<

 its results of operations or financial condition. Banks that are considered systemically important in the context of the Swedish banking system, which currently comprise the four major Swedish banks, are subject to more stringent demands than

<<<

 other banks. The requirement for additional capital at a later stage could encompass more banks, including SBAB.
Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
To complement the CRD IV legislative package, on 2 July 2014, the directive providing for

<<<

 the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (Directive 2014/59/EU) (known as the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive ("BRRD")) entered into force. Each Member State

<<<

 had until 1 January 2015 to transpose the BRRD into national law, other than the bail-in provisions (as contained in Section 5 of Chapter IV of Title IV) for which the implementation deadline was 1 January 2016. The purpose of the BRRD is to

<<<

 harmonise national rules on bank recovery and resolution, providing authorities with common tools and powers to address banking crises proactively in order to safeguard financial stability and minimise taxpayers' exposure to losses.
The BRRD

<<<

 establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and, inter alia, requires EU credit institutions to produce and maintain recovery plans setting out the arrangements that may be taken to restore the long-term viability

<<<

 of the firm in the event of a material deterioration of its financial position. National resolution authorities (the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) for Sweden), in consultation with competent authorities (the SFSA for Sweden), are required

<<<

 to prepare resolution plans setting out how a firm might be resolved in an orderly fashion and its essential functions preserved, if it were to fail. This includes the potential application of the resolution tools and powers referred to below

<<<

 as well as options for ensuring the continuity of critical functions.
The BRRD contains a number of resolution tools and powers intended to ensure that resolution authorities across the EU have a harmonised toolkit to manage firms' failure

<<<

 provided that the resolution conditions are satisfied. These tools and powers may be used alone or in combination and include the following: (i) a sale of business tool - which enables resolution authorities to direct the sale of the firm or

<<<

 the whole or part of its business on commercial terms; (ii) a bridge institution tool - which enables resolution

authorities to transfer all or part of the business of the firm to a "bridge institution" (an entity created for this purpose

<<<

 that is wholly or partially in public control); (iii) an asset separation tool - which enables resolution authorities to transfer impaired or problem assets to one or more publically owned asset management vehicles to allow them to be managed

<<<

 with a view to maximising their value through eventual sale or orderly wind-down; and (iv) a general bail-in tool - which gives resolution authorities the power to write-down all or a portion of the principal amount of, or interest on, certain

<<<

 other eligible liabilities (which could include the Notes), whether subordinated or unsubordinated, of a firm in resolution and/or to convert certain unsecured debt claims including senior notes and subordinated notes (such as the Notes) into

<<<

 another security, including CET1 instruments of the surviving entity, which equity could also be subject to any further application of the general bail-in tool. This means that most of such failing firm's debt could be subject to bail-in, except

<<<

 for certain classes of debt, such as deposits and secured liabilities.

One of the key principles in the BRRD is that the shareholders of a failing firm must bear the first losses in case of a failure. Prior to taking any resolution action

<<<

 that would result in losses for the creditors of the failing firm, the authorities must therefore impose losses on the shareholders by cancelling or severely diluting their shares. Article 48 of the BRRD establishes the sequence in which resolution

<<<

 authorities should apply the general bail-in tool: in general, shareholders' claims should be exhausted before those of subordinated creditors (such as Noteholders) and only when those claims are exhausted can resolution authorities impose

<<<

 losses on senior claims.

The BRRD also provides that a Member State may as a last resort, after having assessed and exploited the above resolution tools to the maximum extent possible whilst maintaining financial stability, provide extraordinary

<<<

 public financial support through additional financial stabilisation tools. These consist of the public equity support and temporary public ownership tools. Any such extraordinary financial support must be provided in accordance with the EU

<<<

 state aid framework.

A resolution authority (the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) for Sweden) will only be permitted to use resolution powers and tools in relation to a firm if it determines that all the conditions for resolution are

<<<

 satisfied. These conditions are (a) the determination that the firm is failing or likely to fail (the 'failure condition') (which, in the case of Sweden, will be determined by the SFSA); (b) there is no reasonable prospect that any solution

<<<

, other than a resolution action taken in respect of the firm, would prevent the failure of the firm within a reasonable timeframe (the 'no alternative condition'), and (c) intervention through resolution action is necessary in the public interest

<<<

 (the 'public interest condition').

According to the BRRD, a firm will be considered as failing or likely to fail when:

(i)

it is, or is likely in the near future to be, in breach of its requirements for continuing

authorisation;

(ii) its

<<<

 assets are, or are likely in the near future to be, less than its liabilities;

(iii) it is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or

(iv) it requires extraordinary public financial support (except

<<<

 in limited circumstances).

In addition to the general bail-in tool, the BRRD provides for relevant authorities to have the further power, before any other resolution action is taken, to permanently write-down or convert into equity relevant

<<<

 capital instruments such as the Notes at the point of non-viability (see the risk factor "Loss absorption at the point o fnon-viability o f the Issuer" below for further information).
The powers set out in the BRRD will impact how firms are

<<<

 managed as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors. Under the BRRD regime, Noteholders may be subject to write-down or conversion into equity on any application of the general bail-in tool and non-viability loss absorption

<<<

. In such circumstances, this may result in Noteholders losing some or all of their investment. The general bail-in tool can be used to recapitalise a firm that is failing or about to fail, allowing authorities to restructure it through the

<<<

 resolution process and restore its viability after reorganisation and restructuring. The write down and conversion power can be used either together with, or also, independently of, a resolution action. Other powers provided to resolution authorities

<<<

 under the BRRD in respect of debt instruments (which could include the Notes) include replacing or substituting the firm as obligor in respect of such debt instruments; modifying the terms of debt instruments (including altering the maturity

<<<

 and/or the

17

amount of interest payable and/or imposing a temporary suspension on payments), and/or discontinuing the listing and admission to trading of debt instruments. The exercise of any power under the BRRD or any suggestion of such

<<<

 exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the rights of Noteholders, the price or value of the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.
Going forward, the BRRD also impacts on how large

<<<

 a capital buffer a firm will need, in addition to those set out in CRD IV. To ensure that firms always have sufficient loss-absorbing capacity, the BRRD requires firms to maintain at all times a sufficient aggregate amount of own funds (as

<<<

 defined in Article 4(1)(118) of the CRD IV Regulation) and 'eligible liabilities' (namely, liabilities and other instruments that do not qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital and that may be bailed-in using the bail-in tool). This is known as

<<<

 the minimum requirement for eligible liabilities ("MREL"). The minimum requirement is calculated as the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities expressed as a percentage of the total liabilities and own funds of the firm. Resolution authorities

<<<

 (the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) for Sweden), after consultation with the relevant competent authorities (the SFSA for Sweden) are responsible for determining the minimum requirement for each firm on the basis of, amongst other criteria

<<<

, its size, risk and business model. See "EBA draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on criteria for determining the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities under the BRRD" below for further information regarding the determination

<<<

 of an institution's MREL under the BRRD. Eligible liabilities may be senior or subordinated, provided they have a remaining maturity of at least one year and, if governed by a non-EU law, they must be able to be written down or converted under

<<<

 that law or through contractual provisions.
The BRRD has been implemented into Swedish law by the Resolution Act (Sw. Lag (2015:1016) om resolution) and the Precautionary Support Act (Sw. Lag (2015:1017) om förebyggande statligt stöd till kreditinstitut

<<<

), both of which entered into force on 1 February 2016. The National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) has been appointed as resolution authority and has been given certain powers which can be categorised into preventive powers, early intervention

<<<

 powers and resolution powers. Ultimately, the authority may take control of a failing firm and, for example, transfer the firm to a private purchaser or to a publicly controlled entity pending a private sector arrangement. All these actions

<<<

 can be taken without any prior shareholder approval.
The primary objective of the BRRD and the Resolution Act is to maintain financial stability. All credit institutions are covered by the regime and may thus potentially be subject to resolution

<<<

 actions, including the Issuer and the SBAB Group. A prerequisite for initiating resolution actions is, however, that it is deemed necessary and proportionate in order to achieve the resolution objectives, such as systemic stability concerns

<<<

. The BRRD and the Resolution Act also provide that shares and other tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments may be written-down/converted independently of resolution and, accordingly, these actions may be taken even if the criteria for initiating

<<<

 resolution action are not satisfied.
It is not possible to predict exactly how the powers and tools of the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) described in the BRRD and the Resolution Act will affect the Issuer and the SBAB Group. Accordingly

<<<

, it is not possible to assess the full impact of the BRRD and the Resolution Act on the Issuer and the SBAB Group. The powers and tools given to the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) are numerous and may have a significant impact on the

<<<

 Issuer, the SBAB Group and the Notes.
Loss absorption at the point of non-viability o f the Issuer
Noteholders are subject to the risk that the Notes may be required to absorb losses as a result of statutory powers conferred on resolution and

<<<

 competent authorities in Sweden (the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) and the SFSA). This is in addition to any contractual loss absorbency measures which are provided for, and may be imposed upon Noteholders, under the Conditions (see

<<<

 "Loss Absorption following a Trigger Event" below). As noted above, the powers provided to resolution and competent authorities (the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) and the SFSA for Sweden) in the BRRD include write-down/conversion powers

<<<

 to ensure that relevant capital instruments (such as the Notes) fully absorb losses at the point of non-viability of the issuing firm in order to allow it to continue as a going concern subject to appropriate restructuring. As a result, the

<<<

 BRRD contemplates that resolution authorities (the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) for Sweden) may require the permanent write-down of such capital instruments (which write-down may be in full) or the conversion of them into CET1 instruments

<<<

 at the point of non-viability (which CET1 instruments may also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool described above) and before any other bail-in or resolution tool can be used. Measures ultimately adopted in this area

<<<

 may apply to any debt currently in issue, including the Notes.
18

For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point of non-viability under the BRRD is the point at which one or more of the following

<<<

 circumstances apply: (a) the determination has been made by the relevant authority that the conditions for resolution (i.e. the 'failure condition', the 'no alternative condition' and the 'public interest condition' described above under "Bank

<<<

 Recovery and Resolution Directive") have been met, before any resolution action is taken; (b) the relevant authority determines that unless the write-down/conversion power is exercised in relation to the relevant capital instruments, the firm

<<<

 "will no longer be viable" (as described in Article 59(4) of the BRRD) and/or (c) extraordinary public financial support is required by the firm.
The application of any non-viability loss absorption measure may result in Noteholders losing

<<<

 some or all of their investment. Any such conversion to equity or write-off of all or part of an investor's principal (including accrued but unpaid interest) shall not constitute an event of default and Noteholders will have no further claims

<<<

 in respect of any amount so converted or written off. The exercise of any such power may be inherently unpredictable and may depend on a number of factors which may be outside the Issuer's control. Any such exercise, or any suggestion that

<<<

 the Notes could become subject to such exercise, could, therefore, materially adversely affect the value of the Notes.
EBA draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on criteriafor determining the minimum requirement for ownfunds and eligible

<<<

 liabilities under the BRRD
In order to ensure the effectiveness of bail-in and other resolution tools introduced by the BRRD, the BRRD requires that all in-scope firms have sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities available to absorb losses

<<<

 and contribute to recapitalisation if the bail-in tool were to be applied. Each firm must meet an individual MREL requirement, calculated as a percentage of total liabilities and own funds and set by the relevant resolution authorities (the

<<<

 National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) for Sweden) on a case by case basis. The MREL requirement applies to all EU credit institutions (and certain investment firms), not just to those identified as being of a particular size or of systemic

<<<

 importance.
In determining a firm's MREL, the resolution authority (the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) for Sweden) must have regard to certain criteria specified in the BRRD and the MREL requirement for that firm will be comprised of

<<<

 a number of key elements, including the required loss absorbing capacity of the firm (which will, as a minimum, equate to the firm's capital requirements under CRD IV, including applicable buffers), and the level of recapitalisation needed

<<<

 to implement the preferred resolution strategy identified during the resolution planning process. Other factors to be taken into consideration by resolution authorities (the National Debt Office (Sw. Riksgälden) for Sweden) when setting the

<<<

 MREL requirement include: the extent to which a firm has liabilities in issue which are excluded from contributing to loss absorption or recapitalisation; the risk profile of the firm; the systemic importance of the firm; and the contribution

<<<

 to any resolution that may be made by deposit guarantee schemes and resolution financing arrangements.
Items eligible for inclusion in MREL will include a firm's own funds (within the meaning of CRD IV), along with "eligible liabilities", meaning

<<<

 liabilities which, inter alia, are issued and fully paid up, have a maturity of at least one year (or do not give the investor a right to repayment within one year), and do not arise from derivatives. The MREL requirement may also have to be

<<<

 met partially through the issuance of contractual bail-in instruments, being instruments that are effectively subordinated to other eligible liabilities in a bail-in or insolvency of the relevant firm.
The BRRD's provisions relating to MREL

<<<

 are set out in Article 45 of the BRRD. These provisions will be supplemented by regulatory technical standards ("RTS") drafted by the EBA with a view to be adopted by the European Commission. The key RTS relate to the assessment criteria for

<<<

 determining a firm's MREL under the BRRD, the current version of which are set out in the Annex to an EBA Opinion published in February 2016.
Although Member States were required to implement the MREL requirement from 1 January 2016, the EBA

<<<

 has recommended that resolution authorities allow firms a transitional period of up to four years to reach the applicable MREL requirements.
It should be noted that the Resolution Act, in line with BRRD, requires that all in-scope firms have

<<<

 sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities available to absorb losses and contribute to recapitalisation if the bail-in tool were to be applied (see Chapter 4, section 3 of the Resolution Act).
19

On 26 April 2016, the National Debt Office

<<<

 for Sweden published its consultation paper on the calibration of MREL. Pursuant to the consultation paper, the MREL requirements will be set for every firm in the autumn of 2017. Until then, broadly, the MREL will be set at a level equal to

<<<

 the firm's applicable capital requirements. It can be noted that not all firms will be deemed systemically important for the purposes of the resolution regime. For firms which are not so deemed, the MREL requirements will not exceed the firm

<<<

's applicable capital requirements. The decision on which firms are systemically important will be made in the autumn of 2017.
The extent and nature of the MREL requirements are currently being developed and so it is not possible to determine

<<<

 the exact impact that they will have on the Issuer or the SBAB Group once implemented. The proposals may require the Issuer or other members of the SBAB Group to issue a significant amount of additional eligible liabilities in order to meet

<<<

 the new MREL requirements within the required timeframes. If the SBAB Group was to experience difficulties in raising eligible liabilities, it may have to reduce its lending or investments in other operations.
Risks relating to the Issuer's

<<<

 collateral
Given that a considerable part of the Issuer's loans are secured by mortgage certificates (Sw. pantbrev) in properties located in Sweden or pledges of tenant-owners' rights (Sw. bostadsrätt) in Sweden as collateral, the credit risk

<<<

 is partly related to the performance of the real estate and housing market in Sweden. There can be no guarantees regarding the future development of the value of the collateral. When collateral is enforced, a court order may be needed to establish

<<<

 the borrower's obligation to pay and to enable a sale by execution measures. The Issuer's ability to enforce the collateral without the consent of the borrower is thus dependent on the above-mentioned decisions from a court and the execution

<<<

 measures and on other relevant circumstances in the mortgage market and in the demand for the relevant real property. Should the prices of real property and the housing market substantially decline, this would affect the Issuer. There are many

<<<

 circumstances that affect the level of credit loss, early repayments, withdrawals and final payments of interest and principal amounts, such as changes in the economic climate, both nationally and internationally, changes regarding taxation

<<<

, interest rate developments, inflation and political changes.
Proposal by the Swedish Government to abolish the tax deductibility on interest expenses on certain subordinated instruments
On 30 March 2016, the Swedish Government presented a

<<<

 proposal to abolish the income tax deductibility for interest payments on capital instruments and subordinated loans qualifying as Additional Tier 1 capital (such as the Notes) and Tier 2 capital under the CRD IV Regulation. The Government

<<<

 proposes that the new rules enter into force on 1 January 2017 and apply to interest payments accruing from this date.
Since the proposal is at a very early stage in the legislative process, it is currently not possible to predict with any

<<<

 degree of certainty if and how the proposal will be finally enacted and the impact it may have on the SBAB Group. It may be noted that the Issuer has not relied on interest on the Notes being tax deductible based on the current legislation

<<<

 and case law, so in this respect the proposal will have a limited effect for the Issuer. However, if the proposed rules were to be enacted, the rules would be relevant to consider in relation to all of the Issuer's Additional Tier 1 and Tier

<<<

 2 instruments and would most likely have the effect of increasing the overall tax burden for the SBAB Group which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.
RISKS RELATED TO THE NOTES
Noteholders are

<<<

 subject to credit risk on the Issuer
Noteholders take a credit risk on the Issuer. A Noteholder's ability to receive payment under the Notes is dependent on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its payment obligations, which in turn is dependent

<<<

 upon the financial condition and viability of the Issuer.
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are deeply subordinated. An investor in the Notes assumes an enhanced risk of loss in the event of the Issuer's insolvency
The Notes constitute

<<<

 unsecured, deeply subordinated obligations of the Issuer. In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation (Sw. likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) of the Issuer, the rights
20

of the Noteholders to payments on or in respect

<<<

 of the Notes (which in the case of any payment of principal shall be to payment of the then Prevailing Principal Amount only) shall rank:
(a) pari passu without any preference among themselves;
(b) at least pari passu with payments to holders

<<<

 of any other Additional Tier 1 Instruments and Existing Capital Contribution Securities, and claims of any other subordinated creditors the claims of which are expressed to rank pari passu with the Notes;
(c) in priority to payments to holders

<<<

 of all classes of share capital of the Issuer in their capacity as such holders; and
(d) junior in right of payment to the payment of any present or future claims of (i) depositors of the Issuer, (ii) other unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer

<<<

 and (iii) except as expressed in (b) above, any other subordinated creditors of the Issuer.
In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining after these payments

<<<

 to pay amounts due under the Notes.
Although the Notes may pay a higher rate of interest than comparable Notes which are not subordinated or which are subordinated but not so deeply, there is a significant risk that an investor in the Notes

<<<

 will lose all or some of his investment in the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. See Condition 3 (Status) for a description of the ranking of the Notes.
The Issuer is not prohibitedfrom issuingfurther

<<<

 debt, which may rankpari passu with or senior to the Notes
There is no restriction on the amount or type of debt that the Issuer may issue or incur that ranks senior to, or pari passu with, the Notes. The incurrence of any such debt may reduce

<<<

 the amount recoverable by Noteholders in the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, may limit the ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations in respect of the Notes and could result in Noteholders

<<<

 losing all or some of their investment in the Notes. In addition, the Notes do not contain any restriction on the Issuer issuing securities ranking pari passu with the Notes and having similar or preferential terms to the Notes.
The Notes are

<<<

 of a perpetual nature
The Notes have no fixed final redemption date and Noteholders have no rights to call for the redemption of the Notes. Although the Issuer may redeem the Notes in certain circumstances there are limitations on its ability

<<<

 to do so. Therefore, Noteholders should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time.
The Issuer has the right to redeem the Notes on any Optional Redemption Date

<<<

 or upon the occurrence o f a Tax Event or a Capital Event. This may limit the market value o f the Notes and an investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a manner which achieves a similar effective return
The Notes contain

<<<

 provisions allowing the Issuer to call them on any Optional Redemption Date. To exercise such a call option the Issuer must obtain the prior consent of the SFSA and comply with Applicable Banking Regulations.
In addition, the Issuer may be

<<<

 entitled to redeem the Notes if a Tax Event or a Capital Event (as defined in Condition 1 (Interpretation)) occurs, in each case subject to the prior consent of the SFSA and compliance with certain regulatory conditions set out in the Applicable

<<<

 Banking Regulations. Under the CRD IV Regulation, the SFSA should give its consent to a redemption of the Notes in such circumstances provided that either of the following conditions is met:
(a) on or before such redemption of the Notes, the

<<<

 Issuer replaces the Notes with instruments qualifying as Tier 1 Capital of an equal or higher quality on terms that are sustainable for the income capacity of the Issuer; or
21

(b) the Issuer has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the SFSA

<<<

 that its Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 capital would, following such redemption, exceed the capital ratios required under CRD IV by a margin that the SFSA may consider necessary on the basis set out in CRD IV.

The CRD IV Regulation further provides

<<<

 that the SFSA may only approve any redemption of the Notes upon the occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event before the First Call Date if, in addition to meeting the conditions referred to in one of either paragraphs (a) or (b) above,

<<<

 the following conditions are also met:

(i)

in the case of any such redemption upon the occurrence of a Capital Event, the SFSA considers

the relevant change to be sufficiently certain and the Issuer demonstrates to the satisfaction of

the

<<<

 SFSA that such change was not reasonably foreseeable at the Issue Date; or

(ii) in the case of any such redemption upon the occurrence of a Tax Event, the Issuer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the SFSA that such Tax Event is material

<<<

 and was not reasonably foreseeable at the Issue Date.

The above conditions to any redemption of the Notes upon the occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event only apply to any such redemption of the Notes before the First Call Date and the

<<<

 Issuer may exercise its option to redeem the Notes in such circumstances on or at any time after such date (including as a result of a Capital Event or a Tax Event that occurred before such date) without complying with these conditions. However

<<<

, it will still need to comply with the conditions referred to in one of either paragraphs (a) or (b) above. These conditions, as well as a number of other technical rules and standards relating to regulatory capital requirements applicable

<<<

 to the Issuer, should be taken into account by the SFSA in its assessment of whether or not to permit any early redemption or repurchase. It is uncertain how the SFSA will apply these criteria in practice and such rules and standards may change

<<<

 during the life of the Notes. It is therefore difficult to predict whether at any time, and on what terms, the SFSA will permit any early redemption or repurchase of the Notes.

It is not possible to predict whether or not any other change

<<<

 in the laws or regulations of Sweden or the application or official interpretation thereof, or any of the other events referred to above, will occur and so lead to the circumstances in which the Issuer is able to elect to redeem the Notes,

<<<

 and if so whether or not the Issuer will elect to exercise such option to redeem the Notes. Any decision by the Issuer to exercise any option to redeem the Notes will involve consideration at the relevant time of, among other things, the economic

<<<

 impact of such redemption, the capital requirements of the Issuer and/or the SBAB Consolidated Situation, prevailing market conditions and regulatory developments (see "Call Options may not be exercised" below). It will also require the approval

<<<

 of the SFSA and will be subject to the applicable conditions to such approval outlined above.

There can be no assurances that, in the event of any such early redemption, Noteholders will be able to reinvest the proceeds at a rate that is equal

<<<

 to the return on the Notes. In the case of a redemption of the Notes at the option of the Issuer on any Optional Redemption Date, the Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the

<<<

 Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower

<<<

 rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.

The redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem

<<<

 the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any such period.

Call options may not be exercised

Noteholders have no rights to

<<<

 call for the redemption of the Notes and should not invest in the Notes in the expectation that a call will be exercised by the Issuer. Even if the Issuer is given prior consent by the SFSA, any decision by the Issuer as to whether it will

<<<

 exercise calls in respect of the Notes will be taken at the absolute discretion of the Issuer with regard to factors such as the economic impact of exercising such calls, regulatory capital requirements and prevailing market conditions. Noteholders

<<<

 should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Notes for a period of time in excess of the minimum period.

22

Substitution or Variation of the Notes
Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Capital

<<<

 Event, the Issuer may, subject to the consent of the SFSA and without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Noteholders, substitute or vary the terms of the Notes so that they remain, or become, Qualifying Securities, as provided

<<<

 in Condition 7(h) (Substitution or Variation instead o f Redemption) (provided that such substitution or variation does not itself give rise to any right of the Issuer to redeem, substitute or vary the terms pursuant to Condition 7 (Redemption

<<<

 and Purchase) in relation to the Qualifying Securities so substituted or varied).
Any such substitution or variation may have adverse consequences for Noteholders, dependent on a number of factors, including the nature and terms and conditions

<<<

 of the relevant Qualifying Securities and the tax laws to which a particular holder of the Notes is subject.
Interest rate risks
The Series A Notes bear interest at a fixed rate to but excluding the First Call Date. During that time, holders

<<<

 of such Series A Notes are exposed to the risk that the price of such Notes may fall because of changes in the market yield. While the nominal interest rate (i.e. the coupon) of such Notes is fixed until (but excluding) the First Call Date

<<<

, the market yield typically changes on a daily basis. As the market yield changes, the price of such Notes changes in the opposite direction. If the market yield increases, the price of such Notes falls. If the market yield falls, the price

<<<

 of such Notes increases. Noteholders of Series A Notes should be aware that movements of the market yield can adversely affect the price of such Notes and can lead to losses for such Noteholders.
Holders of Series A Notes should also be aware

<<<

 that the market yield has two components, namely the risk-free rate and the credit spread. The credit spread is reflective of the yield that investors require in addition to the yield on a risk-free investment of equal tenor as a compensation

<<<

 for the risks inherent in such Notes. The credit spread changes over time and can decrease as well as increase for a large number of different reasons. The market yield of the Series A Notes can change due to changes in the credit spread, the

<<<

 risk-free rate, or both.
If the Series A Notes are not called on the First Call Date, the Series A Notes will bear interest at a floating rate from, and including, the First Call Date. The Series B Notes will bear interest at a floating rate

<<<

 from and including the Issue Date. In each case, the floating rate will be payable quarterly, and will be set immediately prior to any floating Interest Period to the then prevailing STIBOR rate plus the Margin.
Noteholders should be aware

<<<

 that the floating rate interest income is subject to changes to the STIBOR and therefore cannot be anticipated. Hence, Noteholders are not able to determine a definite yield of the Notes at the time of purchase, so that their return on investment

<<<

 cannot be compared with that of investments in simple fixed rate (i.e. fixed rate coupons only) instruments.
In addition, Noteholders are exposed to reinvestment risk with respect to proceeds from coupon payments or early redemptions by the

<<<

 Issuer. If the market yield declines, and if Noteholders want to invest such proceeds in comparable transactions, Noteholders will only be able to reinvest such proceeds in comparable transactions at the then prevailing lower market yields

<<<

.
Interest payments on the Notes may be cancelled by the Issuer (in whole or in part) at any time and, in certain circumstances, the Issuer will be required to cancel such interest payments
Interest on the Notes will be due and payable only

<<<

 at the sole discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall have sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any Interest Payment Date.

<<<

 Interest will only be due and payable on an Interest Payment Date to the extent it is not cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Notes. If the Issuer does not make an interest payment on the relevant Interest Payment Date (or if the

<<<

 Issuer elects to make a payment of a portion, but not all, of such interest payment), such non-payment shall evidence the Issuer's exercise of its discretion to cancel such interest payment (or the portion of such interest payment not paid

<<<

), and accordingly such interest payment (or the portion thereof not paid) shall not be due and payable.
Any cancellation of interest (in whole or in part thereof) carried out in accordance with Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) shall in no

<<<

 way limit or restrict the Issuer from making any payment of interest or
23

equivalent payment or other distribution in connection with any instrument ranking junior to the Notes (including, without limitation, any CET1 capital) of the Issuer

<<<

 or the SBAB Consolidated Situation or in respect of any Existing Capital Contribution Security or other Additional Tier 1 Instruments. In addition, the Issuer may without restriction use funds that could have been applied to make such cancelled

<<<

 payments to meet its other obligations as they become due.
Subject to the extent permitted in the following paragraph in respect of partial interest payments, the Issuer shall not make an interest payment on the Notes on any Interest Payment

<<<

 Date (and such interest payment shall therefore be deemed to have been cancelled and thus shall not be due and payable on such Interest Payment Date) if the Issuer has insufficient Distributable Items to make any payment of interest in respect

<<<

 of the Notes scheduled for payment in the then current financial year and any other interest payments paid and/or required and/or scheduled to be paid out of Distributable Items in such financial year in accordance with Applicable Banking Regulations

<<<

 (in each case excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in determining the Distributable Items of the Issuer).
Although the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to make a partial interest payment on the Notes on any

<<<

 Interest Payment Date, it may only do so to the extent that such partial interest payment may be made without breaching the restriction in the preceding paragraph.
In circumstances where Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive (or, as the case

<<<

 may be, any provision of Swedish law transposing or implementing such Article) applies, no payments will be made on the Notes (whether by way of principal, interest, or otherwise) if and to the extent that such payment would cause the maximum

<<<

 distributable amount (if any), determined in accordance with Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive (or, as the case may be, any provision of Swedish law transposing or implementing such Article) then applicable to either the Issuer and/or the

<<<

 SBAB Consolidated Situation (as the case may be) to be exceeded. The maximum distributable amount is a novel concept, and its determination is subject to considerable uncertainty. See "CRD IV introduces capital requirements that are in addition

<<<

 to the minimum capital ratio" below.
Cancelled interest shall not be due and shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, and Noteholders shall have no rights thereto or to receive any additional interest or compensation as a

<<<

 result of such cancellation. Furthermore, no cancellation of interest in accordance with the terms of the Notes shall constitute a default in payment or otherwise under the Notes or entitle Noteholders to take any action to cause the Issuer

<<<

 to be declared bankrupt or for the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest on the Notes will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a

<<<

 result of the interest cancellation provisions of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more

<<<

 sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition.
CRD IV introduces capital requirements that are in addition to the minimum capital ratio
Under CRD IV, institutions will be required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory

<<<

 capital of 8 per cent. of risk weighted assets. In addition to these so-called "own funds" requirements under CRD IV, supervisory authorities may impose additional capital requirements to cover other risks (thereby increasing the regulatory

<<<

 minimum required under CRD IV), which could include further capital requirements such as the additional CET1 capital requirements imposed by the SFSA under the Swedish Pillar 2 framework. The Issuer may also decide to hold additional capital

<<<

.
CRD IV further introduces capital buffer requirements that are in addition to the minimum capital requirement and are required to be satisfied with CET1 capital. It will introduce five new capital buffers: (i) the capital conservation buffer

<<<

, (ii) the countercyclical buffer, (iii) the global systemically important institutions buffer, (iv) the other systemically important institutions buffer and (v) the systemic risk buffer. Some or all of these buffers may be applicable to the

<<<

 Issuer and/or the SBAB Consolidated Situation as determined by the SFSA.
Under Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive, Member States must require that institutions that fail to meet the "combined buffer requirement" (which, as implemented in Sweden

<<<

, involves for the Issuer the combination of the capital conservation buffer, the countercyclical buffer and the systemic risk buffer)
24

will be subject to restricted "discretionary payments" (which are defined broadly by CRD IV as payments

<<<

 relating to CET1 capital, variable remuneration and payments on Additional Tier 1 Instruments such as the Notes). The "combined buffer requirement" and the associated restrictions under Article 141 above were implemented in Sweden on 2 August

<<<

 2014. On 23 June 2015, the SFSA announced that the countercyclical buffer for Sweden would be increased to 1.5 per cent. with effect from 27 June 2016.
Where any such restrictions are to apply they will be scaled according to the extent of

<<<

 the breach of the "combined buffer requirement" and calculated as a percentage of the profits of the institution since the last distribution of profits or "discretionary payment". Such calculation will result in a "maximum distributable amount

<<<

" in each relevant period. As an example, the scaling is such that in the bottom quartile of the "combined buffer requirement", no "discretionary distributions" will be permitted to be paid. As a consequence, in the event of breach of the combined

<<<

 buffer requirement (including where additional capital requirements are imposed by the SFSA that have the result of increasing the regulatory minimum required under CRD IV) it may be necessary to reduce discretionary payments, including in

<<<

 respect of the Notes as required by Condition 5(c) (Interest Cancellation - Maximum Distributable Amount) and the potential exercise by the Issuer of its discretion to cancel (in whole or in part) interest payments in respect of the Notes.

<<<


Loss Absorption following a Trigger Event
The principal amount o f the Notes may be reduced to absorb losses
If at any time the CET1 ratio of the Issuer or the SBAB Consolidated Situation, as calculated in accordance with Applicable Banking

<<<

 Regulations, is less than 5.125 per cent., in the case of the Issuer, or 7 per cent., in the case of the SBAB Consolidated Situation, this shall constitute a "Trigger Event" for the purposes of the Conditions and the Notes will be utilised

<<<

 to absorb any losses of the Issuer and/or the SBAB Consolidated Situation. In such circumstances, the Issuer shall cancel any accrued and unpaid interest (including if payable on the Write-Down Date) and, on the Write-Down Date, reduce the

<<<

 then Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note by the relevant Write-Down Amount. Noteholders may lose all or some of their investment as a result of a Write-Down.
The Issuer's current and future other outstanding parity and junior securities

<<<

 might not include write-down or similar features with triggers comparable to those of the Notes. As a result, it is possible that the Notes will be subject to a Write-Down, while such other securities remain outstanding and continue to receive

<<<

 payments.
The Issuer may determine that a Trigger Event has occurred on more than one occasion and the then Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note may be reduced on more than one occasion, provided that the Prevailing Principal Amount of

<<<

 a Note may never be reduced to below SEK 0.01.
In addition, in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer prior to the Notes being written up in full, Noteholders' claims for principal will be based on the

<<<

 reduced Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes. Further, during any period when the Prevailing Principal Amount of a Note is less than the Initial Principal Amount, interest will accrue on the then Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes

<<<

 and the Notes will be redeemable on any Optional Redemption Date or upon a Tax Event or a Capital Event at the Prevailing Principal Amount, which will be lower than the Initial Principal Amount.
The occurrence o f a Trigger Event is inherently

<<<

 unpredictable and depends on a number o f factors, including those discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs, any o f which may be outside the Issuer's control
The circumstances surrounding a Trigger Event are unpredictable, and

<<<

 there are a number of factors that could affect the CET1 ratio.
The CET1 ratio may fluctuate. The calculation of such ratio could be affected by one or more factors, including, among other things, changes in the mix of the SBAB Consolidated

<<<

 Situation's business, major events affecting the SBAB Consolidated Situation's earnings, dividend payments by the Issuer, regulatory changes (including changes to definitions and calculations of regulatory capital ratios and their components

<<<

, including CET1 capital and risk weighted assets) and the SBAB Consolidated Situation's ability to manage risk weighted assets in both its ongoing businesses and those which it may seek to exit.
25

In addition, the SBAB Consolidated Situation

<<<

 has capital resources and risk weighted assets denominated in foreign currencies, and changes in foreign exchange rates will result in changes in SEK equivalent value of foreign currency denominated capital resources and risk weighted assets

<<<

. As a result, the CET1 ratio is exposed to foreign currency movements.
The calculation of the CET1 ratio may also be affected by changes in applicable accounting rules, or by changes to regulatory adjustments which modify the regulatory capital

<<<

 impact of accounting rules. Moreover, even if changes in applicable accounting rules, or changes to regulatory adjustments which modify accounting rules, are not yet in force as of the relevant calculation date, the SFSA could require the Issuer

<<<

 to reflect such changes in any particular calculation of the CET1 ratio.
Accordingly, accounting changes or regulatory changes may have a material adverse impact on the SBAB Consolidated Situation's calculations of regulatory capital, including

<<<

 CET1 Capital and the Risk Exposure Amount, and the CET1 ratio.
Due to the inherent uncertainty regarding whether a Trigger Event will occur, it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, a Write-Down may occur. Accordingly, the trading behaviour

<<<

 of the Notes is not necessarily expected to follow the trading behaviour of other types of security. Any indication that a Trigger Event may occur can be expected to have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.
The CET1

<<<

 ratio will be affected by the Issuer's business decisions and, in making such decisions, the Issuer's interests may not be aligned with those o f the Noteholders
As discussed, the CET1 ratio could be affected by a number of factors. It will

<<<

 also depend on the SBAB Consolidated Situation's decisions relating to its businesses and operations, as well as the management of its capital position. The Issuer will have no obligation to consider the interests of the Noteholders in connection

<<<

 with the strategic decisions of the SBAB Consolidated Situation, including in respect of capital management. Noteholders will not have any claim against the Issuer or any other member of the SBAB Consolidated Situation relating to decisions

<<<

 that affect the business and operations of the SBAB Consolidated Situation, including its capital position, regardless of whether they result in the occurrence of a Trigger Event. Such decisions could cause Noteholders to lose all or part of

<<<

 the value of their investment in the Notes.
The CET1 ratio shall be calculated by the Issuer and shall be binding on the Noteholders
For the purposes of determining whether a Trigger Event has occurred and if a Write-Down of the Notes is required

<<<

, the Issuer must calculate the CET1 ratio of the Issuer or the SBAB Consolidated Situation, as the case may be, based on information (whether or not published) available to management of the Issuer, including information internally reported

<<<

 within the Issuer pursuant to its procedures for ensuring effective ongoing monitoring of the capital ratios of the Issuer and the SBAB Consolidated Situation. The Issuer will calculate and publish the relevant CET1 ratio on at least a quarterly

<<<

 basis.
The Issuer's calculation of the CET1 ratios of the Issuer and the SBAB Consolidated Situation, and therefore its determination of whether a Trigger Event has occurred, shall be binding on the Noteholders, who shall have no right to challenge

<<<

 the published figures detailing the CET1 ratios of the Issuer or the SBAB Consolidated Situation, as the case may be.
Any Write-Up o f the Notes is at the sole and absolute discretion o f the Issuer and may require unanimous shareholder approval

<<<


Any Write-Up shall apply at the sole and absolute discretion of the Issuer. However, the Issuer's ability to Write-Up the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes is subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount (when the amount of the Write

<<<

-Up is aggregated together with other distributions of the Issuer or the SBAB Consolidated Situation, as applicable, of the kind referred to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (or, if different, any provision of Applicable Banking Regulations

<<<

 implementing Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive)) not being exceeded thereby. In addition, any such Write-Up may constitute a "transfer of value" (värdeöverföring) for the purposes of the Swedish Companies Act which would require the unanimous

<<<

 approval of the shareholders of the transferor (i.e. the Issuer) at the time of the transfer. As at the date of this Prospectus, the Issuer's sole shareholder is the Swedish state. No assurance
26

can be given that the Issuer's shareholder

<<<

 will approve any such Write-Up at the relevant time nor that the Issuer will continue to be owned solely by the Swedish state.
Furthermore, the Issuer will not in any circumstances be obliged to write up the Prevailing Principal Amount of the

<<<

 Notes, but any Write-Up must be undertaken on a pro rata basis with the other Notes and with any other Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments of the Relevant Entity that have terms permitting a principal write-up to occur on a similar basis

<<<

 to that set out in these provisions in the circumstances existing on the date of the relevant Write-Up.
The Notes may be subject to loss absorption on any application o f the general bail-in tool or at the point o f non-viability of the Issuer

<<<


With regard to risks applying to Noteholders in the context of loss absorption at the point of non-viability of the Issuer and resolution and further risks in connection with regulatory aspects concerning financial institutions in general,

<<<

 please see "Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive" and "Loss absorption at the point o fnon-viability o f the Issuer" above.
There are no events of default in relation to the Notes
In accordance with CRD IV, Noteholders have no ability to

<<<

 require the Issuer to redeem their Notes. The terms of the Notes do not, therefore, provide for any events of default. The Issuer is entitled to cancel the payment of any interest payments in whole or in part at any time and as further contemplated

<<<

 in Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) and such cancellation will not constitute any event of default or similar event or entitle Noteholders to take any related action against the Issuer.
Notwithstanding that the Notes are perpetual securities

<<<

 and have no fixed date for redemption, Noteholders may prove or claim payment under the laws of Sweden and as further provided in Condition 10 (Bankruptcy or Liquidation) in the bankruptcy or liquidation of the Issuer in respect of the then

<<<

 Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that has not been cancelled. However, these are the only circumstances in which any such claim for payment may be made by the Noteholders.
If

<<<

 the Issuer exercised its right to redeem or purchase the Notes in accordance with Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) but failed to make payment of the relevant Prevailing Principal Amount to redeem the Notes when due, such failure would

<<<

 not constitute an event of default but may entitle Noteholders to bring a claim for breach of contract against the Issuer, which, if successful, could result in damages. Following any such failure to pay amounts in respect of the Notes when

<<<

 due, Noteholders may also institute proceedings with a view to having the Issuer declared bankrupt and to prove or claim in the bankruptcy of the Issuer but may only otherwise claim payment in respect of the Notes in the bankruptcy or liquidation

<<<

 of the Issuer.
Reliance on Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
The Notes will be represented on issue by one or more Global Notes that will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the limited

<<<

 circumstances described in each Global Note, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective direct and indirect participants will maintain records of the beneficial interests

<<<

 in each Global Note. While the Notes are represented by a Global Note, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through the relevant clearing systems and their respective participants.
While the Notes are represented

<<<

 by Global Notes, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments through the relevant clearing systems. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing

<<<

 systems and their participants to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in any Global Notes.
Noteholders of beneficial

<<<

 interests in a Global Note will not have a direct right to vote in respect of the Notes so represented. Instead, such holders will be permitted to act only to the extent that they are enabled by the relevant clearing systems and their participants

<<<

 to appoint appropriate proxies.
27

Meetings o fNoteholders: the Conditionspermit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders
The Conditions contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests

<<<

 generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including those Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
Modifications
The

<<<

 Fiscal Agent and the Issuer may agree, subject to the SFSA's prior consent but without the consent or sanction of any of the Noteholders or Couponholders, to:
(a) any modification (except as described in Condition 14(a) (Meetings o f Noteholders

<<<

)) of the Agency Agreements which is not, in the opinion of the Issuer, prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders; or
(b) any modification of the Notes, the Coupons, the Deeds of Covenant or the Agency Agreements which is, in the opinion

<<<

 of the Issuer, of a formal, minor or technical nature or is made to correct a manifest error or to comply with mandatory provisions of the law.
Any such modification will be binding on the Noteholders and Couponholders.
The Notes may be subject

<<<

 to withholding taxes under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within the clearing systems, in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that FATCA will affect the amount

<<<

 of any payment received by the clearing systems (see "Taxation - Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act"). However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor

<<<

 if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. It also may affect payments to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding

<<<

 under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to

<<<

 be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any

<<<

 information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. Investors should consult their own tax adviser to obtain a more detailed explanation of

<<<

 FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has paid the common depositary for the clearing systems (as bearer of the Notes) (such payments being made via the Paying Agents) and the Issuer

<<<

 has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the hands of the clearing systems and custodians or intermediaries.
Theproposedfinancial transactions tax may negatively affect Noteholders or the Issuer.
On 14 February

<<<

 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax ("FTT") in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia

<<<

 (the "participating Member States"). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market

<<<

 transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt.
Under the Commission's Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating

<<<

 Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed

<<<

 to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings

<<<

 is issued in a participating Member State.
28

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional

<<<

 EU Member States may decide to participate.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
The value of the Notes could be adversely affected by a change in English or Swedish Law

<<<

 or administrative practice
The Conditions and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection therewith are based on English law (except for Condition 3 (Status) and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in respect

<<<

 of Condition 3 (Status) which shall be governed by Swedish law) and, in each case, in effect as at the Issue Date. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English or Swedish law or administrative

<<<

 practice after the date of issue of the Notes and any such change could materially adversely impact the value of the Notes.
There is no active trading marketfor the Notes
The Notes will be new securities which may not be widely distributed

<<<

 and for which there is currently no active trading market. If a market does develop, it may not be liquid or may become illiquid at a later stage. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide

<<<

 them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. If the Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount to their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest

<<<

 rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and the financial condition of the Issuer.
Although applications have been made for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange

<<<

, there can be no assurances that the application will be accepted, that the Notes will be so admitted or that an active trading market will develop. Accordingly, there can be no assurances as to the development or liquidity of any trading market

<<<

 for the Notes.
The Notes are subject to risks related to exchange rates and exchange controls
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in Swedish Krona. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor

<<<

's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than Swedish Krona. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation

<<<

 of the Specified Currency or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency

<<<

 relative to Swedish Krona would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency equivalent market value of

<<<

 the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. As a

<<<

 result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
Credit ratings assigned to the Issuer or the Notes may not reflect all the risks associated with an investment in the Notes
The Notes are expected

<<<

 to be assigned a credit rating of BB+ by Standard & Poor's and Ba2 (hyb) by Moody's. This rating may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may

<<<

 affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. Any such revision, suspension or withdrawal could adversely

<<<

 affect the market value of the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer does not commit to ensure that any specific rating of the Notes will be upheld nor that any credit rating agency rating the Notes will remain the same.
In general

<<<

, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the
29

EU and registered under the CRA Regulation

<<<

 (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended), subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending. Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit

<<<

 ratings issued by nonEU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement

<<<

 action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority ("ESMA") on its website in accordance with the

<<<

 CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the

<<<

 updated ESMA list. Certain information with respect to the Issuer's ratings, the ratings of the Notes and the credit rating agencies which have assigned such ratings is set out on page ii of this Prospectus. European Monetary Union (EMU) In

<<<

 the event that Sweden joins the EMU while the Notes remain outstanding, this could adversely affect investors. If the euro becomes the legal currency in Sweden, the Notes will be paid in euro. Furthermore, it may become allowed or required

<<<

 by law to convert outstanding securities denominated in Swedish Krona to euro and that other measures are taken. A transition to euro may be followed by an interest rate disturbance which may have an adverse effect on an investment in the Notes

<<<

.

4.

Interest

(a) Interest Payment Dates

Subject to Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 6 (Loss Absorption and Discretionary Reinstatement

<<<

) below, the Notes bear interest on their Prevailing Principal Amount from and including the Issue Date, payable (subject as provided below) annually in

36

arrear on 17 June in each year from and including 17 June 2017 to and including the

<<<

 First Call Date (each a "Fixed Interest Payment Date"). There will be a long first Interest Period in respect of the period from and including the Issue Date to but excluding the Fixed Interest Payment Date falling on 17 June 2017. Thereafter

<<<

, and subject to Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) below, interest will be payable quarterly in arrear on 17 March, 17 June, 17 September and 17 December in each year from and including 17 September 2021 (together with each Fixed Interest

<<<

 Payment Date, each an "Interest Payment Date"). If any Interest Payment Date (other than a Fixed Interest Payment Date) would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day it shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day

<<<

 unless it would then fall into the next calendar month in which event such Interest Payment Date shall be the first preceding day that is a Business Day.

Whenever it is necessary to compute an amount of interest in respect of the Notes for

<<<

 a period other than an Interest Period and such period ends prior to the First Call Date or on the First Call Date, such interest shall be calculated by applying the Fixed Rate of Interest to the Prevailing Principal Amount of such Note, multiplying

<<<

 such sum by the Fixed Day Count Fraction and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest SEK 0.01, SEK 0.005 being rounded upwards, or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention.

Whenever it is necessary to calculate an amount

<<<

 of interest in respect of the Notes for a period beginning on or after the First Call Date, such interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the relevant period divided by 360 and otherwise in accordance with Condition

<<<

 4(c) (Determination o fFloating Rate o fInterest and Interest Amount) below.

(b) Interest Rate

The rate of interest payable in respect of each Interest Period ending prior to the First Call Date shall be 5.052 per cent. per annum (the "Fixed

<<<

 Rate of Interest"). Thereafter, the rate of interest payable from time to time in respect of the Notes (the "Floating Rate of Interest") will be determined on the basis of the following provisions:

(i)

on each Interest Determination Date

<<<

, the Agent Bank will determine the Screen Rate at

approximately 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on that Interest Determination Date. If the

Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will request each of the Reference Banks to

provide the Agent

<<<

 Bank with the rate at which deposits in SEK are offered by it to

prime banks in the Swedish interbank market for three months at approximately 11.00

a.m. (Stockholm time) on the Interest Determination Date in question and for a

Representative

<<<

 Amount;

(ii) the Floating Rate of Interest for the relevant Interest Period shall be the relevant Screen Rate plus the Margin or, if the Screen Rate is unavailable, and at least two of the Reference Banks provide such rates, the arithmetic

<<<

 mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) as established by the Agent Bank of such rates, plus the Margin; and

(iii) if fewer than two rates are provided as requested, the Floating Rate of

<<<

 Interest for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by major banks in Stockholm selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on the first day of such Interest Period for loans in SEK

<<<

 to leading Swedish banks for a period of three months commencing on the first day of such Interest Period and for a Representative Amount, plus the Margin. If the Floating Rate of Interest cannot be determined in accordance with the above provisions

<<<

, the Floating Rate of Interest shall be determined as at the last preceding Interest Determination Date (unless the Floating Rate of Interest cannot be determined in respect of the Interest Period commencing on the Interest Payment Date falling

<<<

 on the First Call Date, in which case the Floating Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be the Screen Rate on the last calendar day preceding the relevant Interest Determination Date in respect of such Interest Period on which the

<<<

 Screen Rate was displayed, plus the Margin).

37

(c) Determination of Floating Rate of Interest and Interest Amount

In respect of each Interest Period commencing on or after the First Call Date, the Agent Bank shall at or as soon as reasonably

<<<

 practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on each Interest Determination Date determine the SEK amount (the "Interest Amount") payable in respect of interest on each Note for the relevant Interest Period. The Interest Amount shall be determined

<<<

 by applying the Floating Rate of Interest to the Prevailing Principal Amount of such Note, multiplying such sum by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest SEK

<<<

 0.01, SEK 0.005 being rounded upwards, or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention.

(d) Publication of Floating Rate of Interest and Interest Amount

The Agent Bank shall cause the Floating Rate of Interest and the Interest

<<<

 Amount for each Interest Period commencing on or after the First Call Date and the relative Interest Payment Date to be notified to the Issuer and the Paying Agents and to any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are

<<<

 at the relevant time listed (by no later than the first day of each Interest Period) and to be published in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) as soon as possible after their determination, and in no event later than the second Business

<<<

 Day thereafter. The Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Period.

<<<



(e) Notifications, etc. to be final

All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 4, whether by the

<<<

 Reference Banks (or any of them) or the Agent Bank, will (in the absence of wilful default, fraud and manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Agent Bank, the Paying Agents and all Noteholders and Couponholders and (in the absence of wilful

<<<

 default or fraud) no liability to the Issuer, or the Noteholders or the Couponholders shall attach to the Reference Banks (or any of them) or the Agent Bank in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by any of them of their powers, duties

<<<

 and discretions under this Condition 4.

(f) Agent Bank

The Issuer shall procure that, so long as any of the Notes remains outstanding, there is at all times an Agent Bank for the purposes of the Notes. In the event of the appointed office

<<<

 of any bank being unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Agent Bank or failing duly to determine the Floating Rate of Interest and the Interest Amount for any Interest Period, the Issuer shall appoint another major bank engaged in the

<<<

 Stockholm interbank market to act in its place. The Agent Bank may not resign its duties or be removed without a successor having been appointed.

5.

Interest Cancellation

The provisions of Condition 4 (Interest) above shall be subject to

<<<

 this Condition 5.

(a)

Cancellation o f interest

The Issuer may elect, in its sole and absolute discretion, to cancel in whole or in part any payment of interest which is otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date. Non-payment

<<<

 of any amount of interest scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date will constitute evidence of cancellation of the relevant payment, whether or not notice of cancellation has been given by the Issuer.

(b) Restriction on interest payments

<<<



Payments of interest in respect of the Notes in any financial year of the Issuer shall be made only out of Distributable Items of the Issuer. To the extent that the Issuer has insufficient Distributable Items to make any payment of interest

<<<

 in respect of the Notes scheduled for payment in the then current financial year and any other interest payments and/or distributions paid and/or required and/or scheduled to be paid out of

38

Distributable Items in such financial year in

<<<

 accordance with Applicable Banking Regulations, in each case excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in determining the Distributable Items of the Issuer, then the Issuer will, without prejudice to the right above to cancel

<<<

 all such payments of interest in respect of the Notes, make partial or, as the case may be, no such payment of interest in respect of the Notes.

(c) Maximum Distributable Amount

No payment of interest will be made in respect of the Notes

<<<

 if and to the extent that such payment would cause the Maximum Distributable Amount (if any) then applicable to the Issuer and/or the SBAB Consolidated Situation to be exceeded.

(d) Interest non-cumulative

If any payment of interest (or part

<<<

 thereof) is cancelled in accordance with this Condition 5, then the right of the Noteholders to receive the relevant interest payment (or part thereof) in respect of that Interest Period will be extinguished (and shall not accumulate) and the

<<<

 Issuer will have no obligation to pay such interest (or part thereof) or to pay any interest thereon, whether or not interest on the Notes is paid in respect of any future Interest Period.

(e) No default

Failure to pay such interest (or the

<<<

 cancelled part thereof) in accordance with this Condition 5 shall not constitute an event of default or the occurrence of any event related to the insolvency of the Issuer or entitle Noteholders to take any action to cause the Issuer to be

<<<

 declared bankrupt or for the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer.

(f) Notice o fInterest Cancellation

The Issuer shall provide notice of any cancellation of interest (in whole or in part) to the Noteholders and the Fiscal

<<<

 Agent as soon as possible. If reasonably practicable, the Issuer shall provide such notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. Failure to provide such notice will not have any impact on the effectiveness

<<<

 of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation or deemed cancellation of interest, or give Noteholders any rights as a result of such failure.

6.

Loss Absorption and Discretionary Reinstatement

(a) Write-Down

If a Trigger Event occurs

<<<

 at any time, the Issuer will:

(i)

cancel any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Notes to (but excluding) the

Write-Down Date (as defined below) in accordance with Condition 5 (Interest

Cancellation) above (including if payable

<<<

 on the Write-Down Date); and

(ii) on the Write-Down Date (without any requirement for the consent or approval of Noteholders), reduce the then Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note by the relevant Write-Down Amount (such reduction, a "Write

<<<

-Down" and "Written-Down" shall be construed accordingly), pro rata with the other Notes and taking into account the write down or other loss absorption of any Similar Loss Absorbing Instruments and the prior write-down or other loss absorption

<<<

 of any Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments, provided, however, that if for any reason the Issuer is unable to effect the concurrent (or substantially concurrent) write-down or other loss absorption of any given Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments

<<<

 and/or Similar Loss Absorbing Instruments within the period required by the SFSA, the Notes will be Written-Down notwithstanding that the relevant Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Similar Loss Absorbing Instruments are not also written

<<<

 down or otherwise absorbing losses.

39

(b) Trigger Event Notice

Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Issuer shall give notice to the Noteholders and to the Fiscal Agent, which notice, in addition to specifying that a Trigger Event

<<<

 has occurred, shall specify (i) the date on which the Write-Down shall occur (the "Write-Down Date"), which shall be as soon as practicable and in any event not later than one month following (or such other period as Applicable Banking Regulations

<<<

 may require) the occurrence of the Trigger Event and (ii) if then determined, the Write-Down Amount (together, a "Trigger Event Notice"). If the Write-Down Amount has not been determined when the Trigger Event Notice is given, the Issuer shall

<<<

, as soon as reasonably practicable following such determination, notify Noteholders and the Fiscal Agent of the Write-Down Amount.

Such notice should be given as soon as practicable following the occurrence of a Trigger Event and in any event

<<<

 not later than five (5) Business Days following such occurrence, although any failure by the Issuer to give any such notice to or otherwise to so notify Noteholders will not in any way impact on the effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate

<<<

, any Write-Down, or give Noteholders any rights as a result of such failure.

(c) Write-Down may occur on one or more occasion; No default

A Write-Down may occur on more than one occasion and the Notes may be Written-Down on more than one

<<<

 occasion. A Write-Down will not constitute an event of default or the occurrence of any event related to the insolvency of the Issuer or entitle Noteholders to take any action to cause the Issuer to be declared bankrupt or for the liquidation

<<<

, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer.

(d) CET1 ratios

For the purposes of determining whether a Trigger Event has occurred, the Issuer will (i) calculate the CET1 ratios of the Issuer and the SBAB Consolidated Situation based on information

<<<

 (whether or not published) available to management of the Issuer, including information internally reported within the Issuer pursuant to its procedures for ensuring effective ongoing monitoring of the capital ratios of the Issuer and the SBAB

<<<

 Consolidated Situation and (ii) calculate and publish the CET1 ratios of the Issuer and the SBAB Consolidated Situation on at least a quarterly basis.

(e) Interest accrual on Prevailing Principal Amount

Following a reduction of the Prevailing

<<<

 Principal Amount of the Notes as described above, interest will accrue on the reduced Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note from (and including) the relevant Write-Down Date, and (for the avoidance of doubt) such interest will be subject

<<<

 to Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) and this Condition 6.

(f) Discretionary Reinstatement

If, at any time while any Note remains Written-Down, the Relevant Entity records a positive Net Profit, the Issuer may, in its sole and absolute

<<<

 discretion and subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount (when the amount of the Write-Up is aggregated together with other distributions of the Issuer or the SBAB Consolidated Situation, as applicable, of the kind referred to in Article

<<<

 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (or, if different, any provision of Applicable Banking Regulations implementing Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive)) not being exceeded thereby, increase the Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note (a "Write

<<<

-Up") up to a maximum of the Initial Principal Amount, on a pro rata basis with the other Notes and with any other Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments of the Issuer (in the case where the Relevant Entity is the Issuer) and any Written

<<<

-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments of any members of the SBAB Consolidated Situation (in the case where the Relevant Entity is the SBAB Consolidated Situation) that have terms permitting a principal write-up to occur on a similar basis to that

<<<

 set out in these provisions in the circumstances existing on the date of the relevant Write-Up, provided that the sum of:

(i)

the aggregate amount of the relevant Write-Up on all the Notes (out of the same

Relevant Profits);

40

(ii) the

<<<

 aggregate amount of any payments of interest in respect of the Notes that were paid on the basis of a Prevailing Principal Amount lower than the Initial Principal Amount at any time after the Reference Date;

(iii) the aggregate amount of the

<<<

 increase in principal amount of each such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instrument at the time of the relevant Write-Up (out of the same Relevant Profits); and

(iv) the aggregate amount of any interest payments or distributions in respect

<<<

 of each such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instrument that were calculated or paid on the basis of a prevailing principal amount that is lower than the principal amount it was issued with at any time after the Reference Date,

does not exceed

<<<

 the Maximum Write-Up Amount.

The Issuer will not reinstate the principal amount of any Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments of the Issuer or any member of the SBAB Consolidated Situation that have terms permitting a write-up of such

<<<

 principal amount to occur on a similar basis to that set out in these provisions unless it does so on a pro rata basis with a Write-Up of the Notes.

A Write-Up may be made on more than one occasion in accordance with these provisions until

<<<

 the Prevailing Principal Amount of the Notes has been reinstated to the Initial Principal Amount.

Any decision by the Issuer to effect or not to effect any Write-Up pursuant to these provisions on any occasion shall not preclude it from effecting

<<<

 or not effecting any Write-Up on any other occasion pursuant to these provisions.

If the Issuer decides to Write-Up the Notes pursuant to these provisions, a notice (a "Write-Up Notice") of such Write-Up shall be given to the Noteholders and

<<<

 to the Fiscal Agent specifying the amount of any Write-Up (as a percentage of the Initial Principal Amount of a Note that results in a pro rata increase in the Prevailing Principal Amount of each Note) and the date on which such Write-Up shall

<<<

 take effect. Such Write-Up Notice shall be given at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Write-Up is to become effective.

Following a Write-Up in respect of the Notes, interest will accrue on the increased Prevailing

<<<

 Principal Amount of each Note from (and including) the date on which the relevant Write-Up takes effect, and (for the avoidance of doubt) such interest will be subject to Condition 5 (Interest Cancellation) and this Condition 6.

(g) No Liability

<<<

 o fPaying Agents and Agent Bank

None of the Paying Agents nor the Agent Bank shall have any responsibility for, or liability or obligation in respect of, any loss, claim or demand incurred as a result of or in connection with a Trigger Event

<<<

 or any consequent Write-Down and cancellation of the Notes or any claims in respect thereof, and none of the Paying Agents nor the Agent Bank shall be responsible for any calculation or determination or the verification of any calculation or

<<<

 determination in connection with the foregoing.

 (Occurrence o f a Trigger Event) below, any such notice shall be irrevocable, and the delivery thereof shall oblige the Issuer to make the redemption therein specified.

(c) Redemption upon Tax Event or Capital Event

On 30 November 2010, the SFSA granted the Issuer a licence to conduct banking operations. At an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of the Issuer held on 16 March 2011, it was resolved to adopt new Articles of Association of the

<<<

 Issuer thereby permitting the company to conduct banking operations. In connection therewith, the name of the company was amended to "SBAB Bank AB (publ)".
The Issuer was registered in Sweden on 21 December 1984. Since its registration it has

<<<

 had its registered address in Stockholm. As of 16 November 2015, the Issuer changed its postal address to Box 4209, SE171 04 Solna, Sweden and its visiting address as of that date is Svetsarvägen 24, SE-171 41 Solna, Sweden. The Issuer's registered

<<<

 office was changed from Stockholm to Solna on the same date. The Issuer's organisation number is 556253-7513. The Issuer's telephone number is +46 8 614 43 00.
The Issuer was established for the purpose of acquiring the requisite capital to

<<<

 finance Governmentbacked residential mortgages and commenced its operations on 1 July 1985. Prior to this, Governmentbacked residential mortgages were financed directly via the Government budget. The Issuer's whollyowned subsidiary, AB Sveriges

<<<

 Säkerställda Obligationer (publ) (with the parallel trade name The Swedish Covered Bond Corporation) ("SCBC"), has as its main purpose the issuance of Swedish covered bonds (Säkerställda Obligationer) pursuant to the Swedish Act on Covered

<<<

 Bonds (Sw. Lag (2003:1223) om utgivning av säkerställda obligationer) and conducting activities related thereto. The partly-owned subsidiary FriSpar Kreditkonsult AB (formerly known as FriSpar Bolån AB) ("FriSpar") was voluntarily liquidated

<<<

 and wound up on 19 December 2014.
In the fourth quarter 2015, the Issuer entered into an agreement to acquire Booli Search Technologies AB with subsidiaries ("Booli"), one of Sweden's largest housing sites and search engines for homes. Upon

<<<

 completion on 14 January 2016, Booli became a subsidiary of the Issuer and is included operationally in the Retail business area.

Accounting Principles

<<<


The financial information relating to 2011-2015 in this section "Description o f the Issuer" has been extracted without adjustment from the Issuer's audited financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2015. The consolidated

<<<

 accounts have been prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as adopted by the EU. In addition to these accounting standards, the SFSA's regulations and general guidelines on annual accounts for credit

<<<

 institutions and securities companies (FFFS 2008:25), the Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies (Sw. Lag (1995:1559) om årsredovisning i kreditinstitut och värdepappersbolag) as well as the requirements in the

<<<

 Swedish Financial Reporting Board's recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups are taken into consideration. The Q1 2016 Interim Report fulfils the requirements stipulated under IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.
The Issuer

<<<

, i.e. the parent company of the SBAB Group, applies statutory IFRS, which means that the annual report has been prepared in compliance with IFRS with the additions and exceptions that ensue from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board's recommendation

<<<

 RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities, the SFSA's regulations and general guidelines on annual accounts for credit institutions and securities companies (FFFS 2008:25) and the Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies

 (Sw. Lag (1995:1559) om årsredovisning i kreditinstitut och värdepappersbolag).
The main differences between the SBAB Group's and the Issuer's accounting policies are described on page 80 of the Annual Report 2015 and a more detailed description

<<<

 of the accounting policies in general is included on pages 77-80 of the Annual Report 2015.

Activities
The Issuer's main business operations consist of efficient and profitable lending in the Swedish residential mortgage market aimed at

<<<

 individuals, tenant-owner associations and companies. The Issuer may also finance e.g. acquisitions of offices and other commercial properties, but in relation to the SBAB Group's total loan portfolio, lending to commercial properties is not

<<<

 significant. Besides mortgages and security over shares in tenant-owner associations, the Issuer may also accept other collateral such as shares in limited liability companies. The Issuer has a number of business partners that act as distribution

<<<

 channels for the Issuer's products. In 2007, the Issuer expanded its product range to include savings products for individuals. In 2009, deposit facilities were launched for companies and tenant-owner associations. As a feature of the Issuer

<<<

's plan to broaden its operations, unsecured loans were launched during 2010 and in April 2012, the Issuer was authorised by the SFSA to conduct securities operations in the form of a permit to receive and forward orders in fund units and it

<<<

 began such activities in March 2013. Further, on 28 August 2014, it was announced that the Issuer's board of directors had approved a new strategy to focus on, and develop, the core business areas of mortgages and residential financing, a decision

<<<

 based on a strategic review that pointed to the potential in the Issuer's mortgage business, assuming more efficient operations and an increased focus on mortgage offers, customer communication and sales where the Issuer's savings deposits

<<<

 continues to be an important part of the business. For this reason, the development of bank services such as payment solutions, current accounts and card services was discontinued and the fund offering wound up.
The Swedish Covered Bond Corporation

<<<


The Swedish Covered Bond Corporation, SCBC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer. SCBC's activities are mainly focused on issuing covered bonds in the Swedish and international capital market. To this end, SCBC currently has three funding

<<<

 programmes in place; the domestic bond programme in Sweden, the euro medium term covered note programme (the "EMTCN Programme") in the international market and the Australian covered bond issuance programme. These three programmes have all

<<<

 been assigned the highest possible credit rating (Aaa) by the rating institution Moody's. Other programmes may be established and stand-alone issues may be made from time to time.
SCBC does not conduct any lending operations, but acquires loans

<<<

 primarily from the Issuer and can potentially also acquire loans from other entities. SCBC and the Issuer entered into a master sale agreement on 2 June 2006 (which took effect as of 5 May 2006), pursuant to which SCBC acquired an initial portfolio

<<<

 of loans from the Issuer and which provides for the continuous transfer of loans from the Issuer to SCBC from time to time on the terms and conditions stated therein. The Issuer and SCBC have also entered into a subordination agreement dated

<<<

 2 June 2006 pursuant to which the Issuer has agreed that all present and future claims that it has or may have against SCBC, except any claims that the Issuer may have against SCBC under any derivative agreement entered into pursuant to the

<<<

 Swedish Act on Covered Bonds (Sw. Lag (2003:1223) om utgivning av säkerställda obligationer), will be subordinated to all unsubordinated claims against SCBC in SCBC's bankruptcy.
SCBC's lending to the public after provisions as at 31 December

<<<

 2015 amounted to SEK 215,774 million (SEK 217,579 million as at 31 December 2014).
Creditfacility agreement between the Issuer and SCBC
In December 2008, a multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement was established between the Issuer

<<<

 and SCBC. Under the agreement the Issuer makes available a committed credit facility to SCBC up to an amount equal to SCBC's outstanding covered bonds, from time to time, with an original maturity falling in the period within 364 days from

<<<

 the date of the agreement. The term of the agreement is 364 days and is automatically extended by a further 364 days unless terminated by SCBC or if a default under the agreement is outstanding and the Issuer gives notice to SCBC 30 days prior

<<<

 to the relevant termination date that the agreement should not be extended.
Satisfying the requirements set out in FFFS 2014:12 Chapter 6, §1 and the corresponding requirements in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit

<<<

 institutions and investment firms, SCBC and the Issuer will be supervised as a single liquidity sub-group as part of the liquidity management and risk control provisions pursuant to FFFS 2010:7.

Saving

In April 2007, the Issuer introduced savings products for private customers. During

<<<

 2009, savings products were also made available to corporate customers and tenant-owner associations. Total deposits amounted to SEK 76,639 million as at 31 December 2015 (SEK 60,610 million as at 31 December 2014).

Funding

Short-term funding

<<<



The Issuer mainly finances its short-term funding needs through two commercial paper programmes: the Swedish commercial paper programme and the Euro commercial paper programme. The Issuer is also active in the repo- and deposit markets for

<<<

 short term liquidity needs on a daily basis.

Long-term funding

The Issuer issues its long-term non-covered debt through a euro medium term note programme and may also issue on a stand-alone basis or under additional programmes from time to

<<<

 time. The SBAB Group's covered bond funding is conducted by the Issuer's subsidiary, SCBC, through the EMTCN Programme and the Swedish mortgage covered bond programme and may also be made through SCBC's Australian covered bond issuance programme

<<<

, on a stand-alone basis or under additional programmes from time to time. As part of the long-term funding, the Issuer issued two series of additional tier 1 capital notes in an aggregate amount of SEK 1,500 million in March 2015. Further,

<<<

 the Issuer issued subordinated notes (tier 2 capital) in the amount of SEK 1,000 million in June 2015 as well as two series of subordinated notes (tier 2 capital) in an aggregate amount of SEK 2,450 million in November 2015.

<<<

31 March 2015). Taking the Riksbank's and ECB's haircuts into account, the value of the assets at 31 March 2016 was SEK 76.5 billion (SEK 55.4 billion as at 31 March 2015). The Issuer's liquidity portfolio comprises liquid, interest-bearing

<<<

 securities, mostly with a high rating. Securities holdings are an integrated part of the SBAB Group's liquidity risk management. Holdings in the portfolio are limited by asset class and by country, respectively, and must have the highest rating

<<<

 upon acquisition. In addition to these collective limits, limits for individual issuers may also be set. For more information regarding the liquidity portfolio and the liquidity reserves, please see pages 8 and 24 of the Q1 2016 Interim Report

<<<

.
Regulatory Framework and Capital Requirements
The Issuer's activities are regulated by a number of different rules and regulations, including the Swedish Act on Banking and Financing Activities (Sw. Lag (2004:297) om bank- och fmansieringsrörelse

<<<

). The Issuer is subject to the supervision of the SFSA and the regulations and guidelines issued by the SFSA.
In addition, the Swedish Supervision of Credit and Investment Institutions Act (Sw. Lag (2014:968) om särskild tillsyn över kreditinstitut

<<<

 och värdepappersbolag) and the Swedish Act on Capital Buffers (Sw. Lag (2014:966) om kapitalbuffertar) set forth certain requirements concerning capital adequacy which are based on the Bank for International Settlements regulations and EU capital

<<<

 requirements and, with effect from 1 January 2014, the CRD IV Regulation entered into force in Sweden. The Issuer is also subject to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslag (2005:551)) and its Articles of Association.

TAXATION
Swedish Taxation
The following summary outlines certain Swedish tax consequences o f the acquisition, ownership and disposal o f the Notes. The summary is based on the laws

<<<

 o f Sweden as currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only. The summary is not exhaustive and does thus not address all potential aspects o f Swedish taxation that may be relevant for a potential investor in the Notes

<<<

 and is neither intended to be nor should be construed as legal or tax advice. In particular, the summary does not address the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers o f interest. Specific tax consequences may be applicable

<<<

 to certain categories o f corporations, e.g. investment companies and life insurance companies. Specific tax consequences may also apply when Notes are held by partnerships and as trading assets in a business. Such tax consequences are not

<<<

 described below. Neither does the summary cover Notes which are placed on an investment savings account (Sw. Investeringssparkonto). Investors should consult their professional tax advisors regarding the Swedish and foreign tax consequences

<<<

 (including the applicability and effect o f tax treaties) o f acquiring, owning and disposing o f the Notes in their particular situation.
Non-resident holders o fNotes
As used herein, a non-resident holder means a holder of Notes who is (a

<<<

) an individual who is not a resident of Sweden for tax purposes and who has no connection to Sweden other than his/her investment in the Notes, or (b) an entity not organised under the laws of Sweden.
Payments of any principal amount or any

<<<

 amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax provided that such holder does not carry out business activities from a permanent establishment

<<<

 in Sweden to which the Notes are effectively connected. Under Swedish tax law, no withholding tax is imposed on payments of principal or interest to a non-resident holder of Notes.
Individuals who are not resident in Sweden for tax purposes

<<<

 may be liable to capital gains taxation in Sweden upon disposal or redemption of certain financial instruments, depending on the classification of the particular financial instrument for Swedish income tax purposes, if they have been resident

<<<

 in Sweden or have lived permanently in Sweden at any time during the calendar year of disposal or redemption or the ten calendar years preceding the year of disposal or redemption. Taxation may, however, be limited by an applicable tax treaty

<<<

.
Resident holders of Notes
As used herein, a resident holder means a holder of Notes who is (a) an individual who is a resident in Sweden for tax purposes or (b) an entity organised under the laws of Sweden.
Generally, for Swedish corporations

<<<

 and individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) that are resident holders of Notes, all capital income (e.g. income that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on the Notes) will be taxable. A capital

<<<

 gain or capital loss is calculated as the difference between the sales proceeds, after deduction for sales expenses, and the acquisition cost for tax purposes. The acquisition cost for all Notes of the same kind is determined according to the

<<<

 "average method" (Sw. genomsnittsmetoden).
An individual's capital income such as capital gains and interest is subject to a 30 per cent. tax rate. Limited liability companies and other legal entities are taxed on all income, including capital

<<<

 gains and interest, as business income at the tax rate of 22 per cent.
Losses on listed Notes (Sw. marknadsnoterade fordringsrätter) should generally be fully deductible for limited liability companies and for individuals in the capital income

<<<

 category. Certain deduction limitations may apply for individuals and limited liability companies with respect to losses on financial instruments deemed share equivalents (Sw. delägarrätter) for Swedish tax purposes, not described further herein

<<<

.
Under Swedish tax law, no withholding tax is imposed on payments of principal or interest to a resident holder of Notes. However, if amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid
58

to a private individual

<<<

 (or an estate of a deceased individual) that is a resident holder of Notes, Swedish preliminary taxes (Sw. preliminarskatt) are normally withheld at a rate of 30 per cent.
The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT")
On 14 February 2013

<<<

, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax ("FTT") in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia

<<<

 (the "participating Member States"). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market

<<<

 transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt.
Under the Commission's Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating

<<<

 Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed

<<<

 to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings

<<<

 is issued in a participating Member State.
However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member

<<<

 States may decide to participate.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of

<<<

 1986 (the "Code") (or any regulations thereunder or official interpretations thereof), an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the Code or an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the

<<<

 implementation thereof (or any law implementing such an intergovernmental agreement thereto) ("FATCA") impose a new reporting regime and potentially a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to certain payments to (i) any non-U.S. financial

<<<

 institution (a "foreign financial institution", or "FFI" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a "Participating FFI" by entering into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") to provide the IRS with certain information

<<<

 in respect of its account holders and investors and that is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA and (ii) any investor (unless otherwise exempt from FATCA) that does not provide information sufficient to determine whether

<<<

 the investor is a U.S. person or should otherwise be treated as holding a "United States Account" of the Issuer (a "Recalcitrant Holder"). The Issuer may be classified as an FFI.
In general, the withholding applies currently to certain payments

<<<

 from sources within the United States and will apply to certain payments from sources outside the United States (more specifically, "foreign passthru payments" (a term not yet defined)) no earlier than 1 January 2019. This withholding would

<<<

 not apply to payments in respect of non-U.S. obligations characterised as debt for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or prior to the "grandfathering date", which is the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury

<<<

 regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are published and which are not materially modified after such date. Obligations characterised as equity or which do not have a fixed term for U.S. federal tax purposes are not eligible

<<<

 for grandfathering. Because the Notes do not have a fixed maturity, they are not expected to qualify for grandfathering.
The United States and a number of other jurisdictions have entered into, or are in the process of negotiating, intergovernmental

<<<

 agreements to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (each, an "IGA"). The United States and Sweden have entered into such an agreement (the "U.S.-Sweden IGA") based on the "Model 1" IGA released by the United States. Under the U.S.-Sweden

<<<

 IGA, an FFI in Sweden would not be subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives, unless the FFI is specifically identified by the IRS as not in compliance with the requirements of the U.S.-Sweden IGA and any implementing Swedish

<<<

 legislation. Under the U.S.-Sweden IGA, FFIs in Sweden are required to report certain information in respect of their account holders and investors to the Swedish Tax Authority. An
59

FFI in Sweden currently is not required to withhold under

<<<

 FATCA (any such withholding being "FATCA Withholding") from payments it makes (unless it has separately agreed to do so in respect of certain U.S. source income). Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurances that the Issuer or

<<<

 financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made will not be required to withhold under FATCA if (i) any FFI through or to which payment on such Notes is made is not a Participating FFI, an FFI in an IGA jurisdiction, or

<<<

 otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA or (ii) an investor is a Recalcitrant Holder. If an amount in respect of FATCA Withholding were to be deducted or withheld from interest, principal or other payments made in respect of

<<<

 the Notes, neither the Issuer nor any paying agent nor any other person would, pursuant to the conditions of the Notes, be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the deduction or withholding. As a result, investors may receive less

<<<

 interest or principal than expected. Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within the clearing systems, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Notes by the Issuer, any paying

<<<

 agent and the Common Depositary, given that each of the entities in the payment chain beginning with the Issuer and ending with the clearing systems is a major financial institution whose business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that

<<<

 any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Notes. The documentation expressly contemplates the possibility that the Notes may go into definitive form and therefore that they may be taken out of the clearing

<<<

 systems. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. However, definitive notes will only be printed in remote circumstances. FATCA is particularly complex. The above description is based

<<<

 in part on regulations, official guidance and the U.S.-Sweden IGA, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form.
