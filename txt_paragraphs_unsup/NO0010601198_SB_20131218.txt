 060119.8 11.75 per cent. Dannemora Mineral AB Callable Senior Secured Bond Issue 2011/2016

Oslo, 18 December 2013
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting regarding request for approval of bridge financing into Dannemora Magnetit AB ("Magnetit")
Norsk

<<<

 Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned issue with ISIN N0001 060119.8 (the "Bond Issue") issued by Dannemora Mineral AB ("Dannemora" or the "Company").
Unless otherwise defined

<<<

 herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 18 March 2011 (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this summons regarding the Company and market conditions is provided by

<<<

 the Company, and NTM expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. Introduction and Background
1.1 Executive Summary
The purpose of this summons is to (a) present to the Bondholders for their consideration the

<<<

 term sheet attached as Schedule 1 hereto in respect of emergency, short-term bridge funding to be injected into the Group (the "Super Senior Bond Term Sheet"), which will be underwritten by certain of the largest Bondholders that have formed

<<<

 themselves into an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "Committee") and (b) to seek the approval of the Bondholders to implement the transactions contemplated by the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet.
The background sections of this summons

<<<

 summarise certain elements of the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet and do not replicate in full the detailed provisions of the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet, to which Bondholders should refer.
1.2 Operational Update
The demand for Dannemora's products

<<<

 has been strong and all available production for 2013 is sold out at good price levels. Production of finished products during October and November is approximately 197,000 tons, of which 189,000 tons has left port of Hargs Hamn for delivery

<<<

 to customers. The recovery rate continues to stay at levels above 40 per cent.

During the autumn, agreements have been entered into equivalent to the expected production of finished products in 2014, indicating a strong demand for Dannemora's products. Dannemora's price levels relative to reference price have

<<<

 improved for 2014.
Management considers that operations are approaching the full potential of the current facility. As previously communicated, significant new investments are needed to improve the recovery rate and output of finished products

<<<

. In the absence of such investments, it is unlikely that the company will be able to operate profitably on a sustainable basis.
1.3 Financial Update and Strategic Review
The Company and its Group have forecast a liquidity shortfall to affect

<<<

 the Group at the latest by around the second week of January 2014, after which time the Company will, unless it receives funding commitments in respect of the short-term bridge funding by no later than 19 December 2013, under current circumstances

<<<

 likely be unable to continue operations.
As previously reported, the Company has for some months been working with various advisers (Swedbank First Securities as the Company's financial adviser, Recore AS as its Chief Restructuring Officer

<<<

, Roschier Advokatbyrå AB as its legal adviser and Graneli to assist with financial topics, primarily modelling) to assess its financial and legal position and evaluate potential restructuring and refinancing options with a view to addressing

<<<

 its current financial difficulties for the benefit of its stakeholders as a whole (the implementation of any such option being a "Restructuring").
To date, the Company and its advisers have been unable to secure sufficient financial commitments

<<<

 from potential investors to support a viable Restructuring. However, discussions between the Company and its stakeholders - in particular, the holders of its 11.75 per cent, convertible bonds 2012/2015 (the "Convertible Bonds", the holders

<<<

 of such Convertible Bonds together being the "Convertible Bondholders"), trade partners and Bondholders - and potential investors are continuing, with a view to achieving a Restructuring as soon as possible. However, the Company and its stakeholders

<<<

 will not be able to agree and implement the Restructuring before the liquidity shortfall begins to affect the Company around the second week of January 2014.
To allow the discussions between the Company and its stakeholders and potential investors

<<<

 more time to mature, certain of the Bondholders have agreed to underwrite the "Super Senior Bonds" (as defined in the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet) (subscription of the Super Senior Bonds will be offered to all Bondholders (see below in Section

<<<

 1.4 under "Subscription")). It is expected that the injection of funds into the Group by way of the Super Senior Bonds will give the Company and the Group sufficient cash to avoid a liquidity shortfall until at least the end of January, and

<<<

 possibly until the second or third week of February, depending on how certain discussions with the Group's trade suppliers develop over the coming weeks.
1.4 The Super Senior Bonds
The Super Senior Bonds will be issued as a short-term bridge

<<<

 loan to be constituted in the form of a SEK 21,000,000 Norwegian-law, secured, guaranteed, discounted, super

NORSK TILLITSMANN

senior bond to be issued by Magnetit on or before 10 January 2014 (the date of issuance

<<<

 being the "Super Senior Bond Issuance Date"). The term sheet attached to this summons as Schedule 1 (the "Super Senior Bond Term Sheet") details the key terms of the Super Senior Bonds, a limited summary of which is set out here:
Issuer: Dannemora

<<<

 Magnetit AB

Original Issue Discount: 5% (actual, aggregate subscription price of SEK 19,950,000)

<<<

 assets of significance of Magnetit (being the iron ore product held as inventory, certain items of machinery and certain intra-group receivables), (b) Magnetit's offtake contracts and receivables arising out of those contracts and (c) the escrow

<<<

 account (the "Escrow Account") into which the proceeds from the issue of the Super Senior Bonds will be paid (together, the "Super Senior Bond Security") (see section A10 of the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet for further details). As it will

<<<

 take several weeks to put in place the Super Senior Bond Security, the granting and perfection of that security will be delivered pursuant to one of the Milestone Conditions (see below) after the Super Senior Bonds have been issued
Changes

<<<

 to the Security for the Bonds: The security package securing the Bonds will be amended (as detailed in section A l l of the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet) in order that the Super Senior Security can be established on a firstranking basis.
Ranking

<<<

: Super senior, ranking prior to the Bonds and the Convertible Bonds. The relative ranking of the Super Senior Bonds and the Bonds will be governed by the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet), pursuant to

<<<

 which the holders of the Super Senior Bonds and the Bondholders will vote as one class for the purposes of giving security enforcement instructions to the Security Agent (with a 2/3 approval threshold)
Milestone Conditions: As detailed in section

<<<

 C2 of the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet, if certain events do not occur by the dates specified, an event of default will be triggered under the Super Senior Bonds. Such milestone events principally concern the delivery of documentation and commitments

<<<

 is no longer viable (see the definition of Restructuring Failure Event of Default in the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet), leading to a draw-stop being imposed on the Escrow Account and/or (b) a draw-stop being imposed on the Escrow Account as

<<<

 a result of a failure of the Company to satisfy certain milestone events (see the definition of Draw-down Block Event in the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet), the Company will, in certain circumstances, be able to continue to make limited draw

<<<

-downs from the Escrow Account where it has no option but to make those draw-downs for the purpose of paying certain tax liabilities (in a maximum aggregate amount of SEK 3,000,000) arising in connection with the payment of employee wages, non

<<<

-payment of which could lead to personal liability arising on the part of the directors of the Company and/or the Parent
Subscription: As described in section B of the Super Senior Bond Term Sheet, the Super Senior Bonds will be offered for

<<<

 subscription to all Bondholders on a pro rata basis (based on each Bondholder's respective holdings of Bonds). Other than the Bondholders who have agreed to underwrite the subscription of the Super Senior Bonds, no Bondholder is obligated to
