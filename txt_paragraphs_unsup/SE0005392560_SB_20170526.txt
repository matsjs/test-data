SEK Bonds: This notice has been sent by letter to persons directly registered in the debt register (Sw. skuldbok) kept by Euroclear Sweden AB as holders of SEK

<<<

 Bonds. If you are an authorised nominee under the Swedish Financial Instruments Accounts Act or if you otherwise are holding Bonds on behalf of someone else on a Securities Account, please forward this notice to the holder you represent at

All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this notice (the "Notice") shall have the meanings assigned to them in the terms

<<<

 and conditions o f the Bonds (the "Terms and Conditions"). Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) (formerly known as Swedish Trustee AB (publ)) acts as agent (the "Agent") for the holders of the above mentioned Bonds issued by Real People Investment

<<<

 Holdings Limited (the "Issuer"). In its capacity as Agent, and requested by the Issuer, the Agent hereby initiates a written procedure, whereby holders o f the Bonds can vote for or against requests made by the Issuer and described in this

<<<

 Notice. NOK Bonds and SEK Bonds have been issued under the Terms and Conditions. The holders o f the NOK Bonds and the SEK Bonds participate in the same written procedure. Due to technical differences between the systems operated by the CSDs

<<<

 (VPS (Norway) for NOK Bonds and Euroclear Sweden for SEK Bonds), formalities vary in some respects. Different voting forms shall therefore be used for the NOK Bonds and the SEK Bonds (referred to as the "NOK Bonds Voting Form " and the "SEK

Voting Form ", respectively) and different evidence o f ownership shall be provided as further described in Sections 3E (Voting with respect to NOKBonds) and 3D (Voting with respect to SEKBonds).
Bondholders participate by completing

<<<

 and sending the relevant voting form, and, if applicable, the relevant evidence o f ownership, authorisation or other sufficient evidence o f entitlement to vote, to the Agent.
The Agent must receive the relevant voting forms no later than

<<<

 5.00 p.m. (CEST), 22 June 2017, by mail, via courier or e-mail to the addresses indicated below in Section 3H (Address fo r sending replies). Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.
To be eligible to participate in the W ritten Procedure

<<<

 a person must fulfil the formal criteria for being a Bondholder at the close o f business on 1 June 2017, regarding the SEK Bonds, and the execution date o f the NOK Bonds Voting Form, regarding the NOK Bonds, (the "Record Date").
This Notice

<<<

 and the Accession and Amendment Requests (as defined below) are presented to the Bondholders, without any evaluation, advice or recommendations from the Agent whatsoever. The Agent has not reviewed or assessed this Notice or the Accession and

<<<

 Amendment Requests (and their effects, should they be adopted) from a legal or commercial perspective o f the Bondholders and the Agent expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to the content o f this Notice and the Accession and

<<<

 Amendment Requests (and their effects, should they be adopted).
1. BACKGROUND
A. Standstill agreement
As previously communicated in press releases, the Real People Group is experiencing financial difficulties and it is expected that the Capital

<<<

 Adequacy Ratio will be below the level prescribed in the Terms and Conditions.
The Issuer believes that it is in the best interest o f the Group's creditors to carry out an orderly and consensual restructuring o f the Group and has therefore

<<<

 entered into a debt standstill agreement with approximately seventy per cent o f its other senior unsecured creditors and one hundred per cent o f its subordinated debt creditors (the "Standstill Agreement") in order to facilitate a restructuring

<<<

 o f its capital structure (the creditors having executed the Standstill Agreement being the "Standstill C r e d ito r s ").
No interest or capital repayments will be made to the Standstill Creditors whilst the standstill period is ongoing.

<<<

 Further, the Standstill Creditors have agreed not to take any enforcement action against the Issuer and the Group during the standstill period, which expires on 31 August 2017 unless further extended by the Super Majority Standstill Creditors

<<<

 (as defined in the Standstill Agreement).
The Standstill Agreement is a vital part o f a successful restructuring process and the issuer therefore requests that the Bondholders become parties to the Standstill Agreement as Additional Standstill

<<<

 Creditors (as defined in the Standstill Agreement).
To limit the risk that Bondholders receive insider information and become subject to insider trading restrictions, the Issuer also proposes that the Bondholders resolve to instruct the Agent

<<<

 not to forward any information provided to it under the Standstill Agreement to the Bondholders.
2

A summary o fthe Standstill Agreement is attached as Schedule 3 and a copy o f the Standstill Agreement is attaches as Schedule 4.

B.

Amendments

<<<

 to the Terms and Conditions

It is likely that a successful restructuring will require that further resolutions are passed by the Bondholders at a later stage. In the interest o f time, the Issuer therefore requests that notice periods are

<<<

 shortened to enable the Bondholders to be able to pass resolutions faster than the current version of the Terms and Conditions permits and that the requisite majority to extent the standstill period under the Standstill Agreement with respect

<<<

 to voting under the Bonds is lowered from 80 per cent to more than 50 per cent o f the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Bondholders are voting.

2.

Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure will, in accordance with the Terms and Conditions: i) be published by way o f press release by the Issuer (ii) be sent by notice to the

<<<

 Bondholders and iii) be published on the websites of a) the Issuer and b) the Agent.
The minutes from the Written Procedure shall at the request o f a Bondholder be sent to it by the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable. A matter decided under

<<<

 the W ritten Procedure will be binding for all Bondholders, irrespective o f them responding in the Written Procedure.
C. Voting rights and authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the W ritten Procedure must on the Record Date (1

<<<

 June 2017) in the debt register:
(i) be registered as a direct registered owner o f a Securities Account; or
(ii) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.
D. Voting with respect to SEK

<<<

 Bonds
Bondholders holding SEK Bonds shall use the SEK Bond Voting Form set out in Schedule 1 to vote.
If you are registered as a direct registered owner with respect to a SEK Bond, you may vote in your own name without providing further evidence

<<<

 o f ownership.
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner with respect to a SEK Bond, but your SEK Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the

<<<

 voting for the SEK Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the SEK Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power o f Attorney (Appendix to SEK Bonds Voting

<<<

 Form) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorization. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorization directly from the intermediary that

<<<

 is registered in the debt register as bondholder o f the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a Bondholder o f the Securities Account

<<<

 as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
W hether one or both o f these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the SEK Bonds on your behalf (and

<<<

 the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the SEK Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and

<<<

 do not know how your SEK Bonds
6

are registered or need authorization or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights. E. Voting with respect to NOK

<<<

 Bonds Bondholders holding NOK Bonds shall use the NOK Bond Voting Form set out in Schedule 2 to vote.

Bondholders holding NOK Bonds must provide a complete printout from VPS (Norway) evidencing their holding o f NOK Bonds, or, if their NOK

<<<

 Bonds are held in custody other than in the VPS (Norway), evidence from their custodian confirming that (i) they are the owner o f the relevant NOK Bonds, (ii) in which account number the NOK Bonds are held, and (iii) the amount o f NOK Bonds

<<<

 owned.

F.

Quorum

To approve the Accession and Amendment Request, Bondholders representing at least fifty (50) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.

If a

<<<

 quorum does not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure.
