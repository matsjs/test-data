Oslo, 25 June 2008
Request for waiver of equity covenant and change of yard - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned Bond issue (the "Loan

<<<

") where MPF Corp Ltd is the borrower (the "Borrower"). The terms and conditions of the Loan are set out in a loan agreement dated 15 September 2006 and an Amendment Agreement dated 9 May 2008 (collectively the "Loan Agreement") between the

<<<

 Borrower and the Loan Trustee. All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement or in this summons unless otherwise stated.
Cost overruns / Writedown The Borrower has informed the Loan Trustee

<<<

 that the capital expenditures to build the MPF01 (the "Drillship") are estimated to be approximately USD 200 million higher than assumed in April 2008. The capital expenditures to complete the Drillship are now estimated at USD 950 million

<<<

. According to the Borrower the cost overruns are mainly due to the termination of the Dragados Contract (as defined below), changes in the scope of the contract with Cosco Dalian Shipyard Co., Ltd. for the construction of the hull (mainly caused

<<<

 by flaws in the original engineering), drilling module modifications, engineering and further upgrades of the subsea equipment.
The additional funding requirements to finalize the completion of the Drillship (on a standalone basis) including

<<<

 all interest costs, supervision, pre-operational equipment, start-up costs and costs related to the establishing of MPF Operating Company LLC in Flouston as a full fledged drilling and production contract service company, are estimated to USD

<<<

 300 million.
Based on the cost overruns and the estimate value of the project in the Q1 accounts, the Borrower has decided to write down its assets with USD 210 million.
Equity covenant - Loan Agreement Clause 13.1. (i) According to the Loan

<<<

 Agreement clause 13.1. (i) the Borrower shall maintain a book equity to capital employed of at least 25% (the "Equity Covenant"). Following the write-down, the Borrower will be in breach of the Equity Covenant.

Actions to be taken The Borrower

<<<

 is in discussions with its bankers and other stakeholders to secure short term funding under its existing loan facilities sufficient to cover the cash requirements through July. Further, the Borrower has mandated DvB to arrange a pre- and post

<<<

 delivery financing.
In addition the Borrower has retained Pareto Securities AS as its financial advisors to evaluate strategic options. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that based on creating an alliance/partnership with an industrial

<<<

 partner there is a positive value for the shareholders and other stakeholders of the Borrower. The process is expected to be concluded over the next 6 weeks.
The Board of Directors has engaged Mr. Richard Petrie as the new CEO of the Borrower

<<<

 with immediate effect. Mr. Petrie is a UK national and holds an engineering degree, an MA from Cambridge and an MBA from INSEAD. He has held senior management positions in contracting and engineering companies in the energy and oil sector where

<<<

 he has managed large construction projects and also related to maritime oil and gas industry. Mr Wilhelm P. Blystad will continue as Senior VP Business Development. Also, Mr. Hans Petter Finne has been engaged by the Board of Directors as Executive

<<<

 Chairman on an interim basis.
Waiver request The Borrower asks for a temporary waiver of the Equity Covenant until 31 July 2008. It is emphasized that the breach of the Equity Covenant is not expected to be remedied by that time. However, the

<<<

 waiver will be given for a month at a time for the Bondholders to evaluate the situation on a continuing basis.
TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT WITH DRAGADOS OFFSHORE S.A. AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH KEPPEL SHIPYARD FOR THE ENTRY INTO OF A NEW CONTRACT

<<<

. According to the Loan Agreement clause 13.2 (g) the Borrower shall not, without the approval of the Loan Trustee or, where necessary, the Bondholders' meeting, "cancel or modify the Construction contract with Dragados Offshore S.A. for the

<<<

 purpose of having another shipyard to construct/finalize the Drillship (in which event the Loan Trustee prior to a possible approval may require an independent opinion on inter alia the reputability of the new shipyard)".
According to the Borrower

<<<

, the shipyard Dragados Offshore S.A. ("Dragados") has, without any pre-warning, presented the Borrower with a variation order request (the "VOR") under the contract entered into between the Borrower and Dragados (the "Dragados Contract"). The

<<<

 background for the VOR was allegedly a request by the Borrower for an acceleration of the project schedule, whereby the delivery of the Drillship would take place in December 2009 as originally scheduled. The VOR would entail substantial delays

<<<

 in the project and in the delivery date for the Drillship in addition to a considerable cost increase. Such delay would inter alia result in the Borrower not being able to deliver the Drillship to Petrobras International under the drilling

<<<

 contract dated 3 April 2008 (the "Petrobras Contract") on time which apart from revenue loss could entail liquefied damage payments under the Petrobras Contract. Further the Borrower concluded that by continuing the Dragados Contract, the Borrower

<<<

 would incur substantial costs without any corresponding value being added to the company.

In order to preserve shareholder value and to ensure a timely delivery of the Drillship (to be able to deliver the

<<<

 Drillship to Petrobras International under the Petrobras Contract in time), the Borrower decided to terminate the Dragados Contract. Prior to such termination the Borrower commenced negotiations with Keppel Shipyard in Singapore ("Keppel")

<<<

 for Keppel to undertake the completion and commissioning of the Drillship. Expected delivery time of the Drillship is December 2009. Upon receiving an offer from Keppel, the Dragados Contract was terminated (effective as of 3 June 2008) and

<<<

 the Borrower is currently in negotiations with Keppel for the new contract.
Loan security - second priority assignment of contract Part of the loan security is a second priority assignment over the Dragados Contract ranking after the security

<<<

 interest of the lenders of the Existing First Priority Debt Facility (the "Senior Lenders").
The termination of the Dragados Contract and the entering into of a new contract with Keppel has been discussed with the Senior Lenders who have given

<<<

 their consent to the change of yard and, according to the Borrower, share the Borrowers' point of view that the change of yard is in the best interest of the Borrower. The Senior Lenders' legal counsel is involved in the final contract negotiations

<<<

 with Keppel to ensure that the contract meets their requirements. The contract with Keppel shall be assigned to the Senior Lenders on first priority and to the Bondholders on second priority.
The Borrower points out that the termination of

<<<

 the Dragados Contract implies a termination of the second priority assigmnent of the Dragados Contract. Flowever, the main part of the work under the Dragados Contract has not yet commenced, nor has the hull of the Drillship been towed to the

<<<

 yard for the work to be performed, consequently the assignment of the Dragados contract had limited value as a security interest at the time it was cancelled. Further, the second priority assignment of contracts for the construction of the

<<<

 hull with Cosco and second priority assignment of equipment contracts etc. are not affected by the cancellation of the Dragados Contract.
Request for approval of termination of contract Based on the above the Borrower asks for the Bondholders

<<<

 approval of the termination of the Dragados Contract on the conditions that
A new contract for the completion and commissioning of the Drillship will be entered into with Keppel by 31 July at the latest and, A new second priority assignment

<<<

 of the contract with Keppel for the completion and commissioning of the Drillship shall be created in favor of the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) as soon as possible after the new contract is established.
POSTPONEMENT OF INTEREST

<<<

 PAYMENT DUE 20 JUNE 2008 Due to the current financial situation as outlined above, the Borrower was unable to make the coupon payment which was due on 20 June 2008. The Borrower proposes that the interest payment that was due on 20 June 20

<<<

08 is postponed and rescheduled to 31 July 2008. Compound Interest shall be calculated on the Remaining Loan and the rescheduled interest payment amount with LIBOR + 6.75 per cent p.a. (margin) + 5 per cent p.a. from and including 20 June 2

<<<

008 to 31 July 2008.
