Evaluation of the Proposal
Based on the information given from the Company, both in this summons

<<<

 and through press releases lately, the current situation has been critical for the Company and all its stakeholders. The receipt of the EDC loan described in Exhibit 1 has a considerable positive effect on Cecon's ability to complete its newbuilding

<<<

 programme at Davie Yards. A loan agreement with EDC will need to be finalized in order for the Borrower to be able to draw on the facility. This will most likely require some adjustments of the Loan in order to fit the EDC facility. The Borrower

<<<

 will summon for a new bondholders meeting to ask for acceptance of such adjustments as soon as possible.
As a result of this positive development on financing, the Loan Trustee recommends that the Bondholders approve the Proposal to give Cecon

<<<

 the time necessary to finalise the financing of its new-building programme. Nevertheless, the Bondholders themselves must evaluate, based on all information given from the Company, whether the Proposal should be accepted.
It is recommended

<<<

 that the Bondholders consult with its own financial and tax advisors to evaluate the consequences of the Proposal. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has challenges going forward and the Company

<<<

 might be unable to meet its commitments in the future.
For further information about the involved company, please also refer to the web site www.cecon.no or www.newsweb.no (for press released from the Borrower).

EXHIBIT 1: BACKGROUND
The following information regarding the operational and financial status o f the Company is provided by the Company. The Loan Trustee

<<<

 expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with such information given from the Company.
Overview of the situation
In August 2008, Davie Yards Inc (Davie Yards) in Quebec, Canada, announced the need for USDm 90 financing

<<<

 as a result of lower than expected productivity and as well as increased costs due to foreign exchange rate changes.
In September 2008, Cecon ASA (Cecon) announced that it had accepted a USDm 40 price increase on the vessels under construction

<<<

 to improve the yard's capitalization and to ensure delivery of Cecon's three vessels currently under construction. As a result, Cecon had to fund this additional price increase. However, the price increase was to be paid upon delivery of the

<<<

 vessels.
In November 2008, Cecon announced that it was not able to meet the semi annual interest payment on the Loan and in December 2008 Cecon announced a further extension of the waiver for the interest payments until 5th February. In December

<<<

, Cecon also announced that it had entered a Heads of Agreement with Bergen Group ASA to secure delivery of Cecon's vessels under construction at Davie Yards in Canada. The deal incentivizes Bergen Group to secure delivery of Cecon's vessels

<<<

 according to the revised construction contract and delivery schedule.
Furthermore, in late December, Export Development Canada (EDC) announced that it will grant refund guarantees towards all remaining pre-delivery installments on Cecon's three

<<<

 new buildings at Davie Yards. The refund guarantees related to Cecon amounts to approx. USDm 160. The issuance of refund guarantees is a central condition in Cecon's agreements with Davie Yards, and a condition precedent for the USDm 200 first

<<<

 priority bank loan.
On January 20th 2009, Cecon announced that it had received a cancellation letter on the USDm 200 senior loan facility to provide the final installments on hull 717 and hull 718 from DnBNOR Bank ASA. No drawdown had been

<<<

 performed against the facility. The reason for the cancellation was that DnBNOR Bank ASA deemed Cecon to be in breach of its covenants mainly as a result of the contractual situation between Cecon and Davie Yards.
At present Davie Yards Inc

<<<

 has temporarily laid off its workers and no work on the hulls is being performed. Cecon has been informed by Davie Yards Inc, that the yard can ramp up production within approx. 1 Vi month.
In January 2009, First Securities and Pareto Securities

<<<

 were engaged by the Company to review all financing and strategic opportunities available to the Company.
On February 16th 2009, Cecon announced that it had received a term sheet from EDC for a USD 200 million senior secured credit facility

<<<

 for its newbuilding programme hulls 717, 718 and 719. The EDC financing in combination with estimated operating cash flow is expected to cover

remaining yard instalments until delivery of the vessels. Following delivery, the loan will be

<<<

 converted to a 12-year senior secured term loan. The term sheet has several conditions which need to be met, and the Company expects to conclude the negotiations on the loan agreement by end February/ early March 2009.
Simultaneously, the Company

<<<

 announced that it had agreed additional price increases with Davie Yards amounting to USDm 23, and in addition, that Davie Yards would receive an additional USDm 1 for each of hulls 718 and 719 subject to timely delivery of these vessels according

<<<

 to the revised delivery schedule. The revised delivery schedule is January 29, 2010 for 717, May 15, 2010 for 718, and July 16, 2010 for 719. A new instalment schedule has been agreed, and is included as Exhibit 2.
As a result, the EDC facility

<<<

 will effectively replace the DnBNOR facility and Cecon requires additional take-out financing of USDm 60 to cover the price increase which is at present unfunded.
Current priorities
Cecon financingfrom. EDC: Cecon and EDC are working to complete

<<<

 the loan documentation by the end of February/early March.
Cecon take outfinancing: Cecon has a takeout financing need of USDm 60 upon delivery of the vessels. Cecon is working with financing alternatives from governmental and commercial organizations

<<<

 and the progress on securing this financing is promising.
Update on current Cecon activities
Current operations, with chartered tonnage, are proceeding as planned. Under a going concern assumption the Company is expecting to make a profit for

<<<

 2008, which will be communicated in the Q4 2008 financial statements. The Company's current operations for 2009 in isolation are promising. At present, Cecon has an order backlog of USDm 27.6 and a letter of intent for additional work to be

<<<

 performed during 2009 amounting to USDm 34. (Contract to be signed during February/March)
On the financing side, Cecon has USDm 7.2 in shareholder loans in addition to the Loan. These are due and secured by the accounts receivables which as

<<<

 of this date amounts to USDm 7.1, and a short-term loan to Davie Yards amounting to USDm 0.7, which is to be repaid upon Davie's drawdown of the USDm 20 EDC facility.
