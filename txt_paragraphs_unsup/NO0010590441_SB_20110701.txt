 three Bond Issues an one-time waiver fee of 0.50 % (flat) of the face value of the Bonds, payable to the Bondholders (with record date on the end of business the date of the Bondholders' meetings), within 10 banking days after the Bondholder

<<<

 meetings, provided that the Bondholders' meetings accept the proposes change as set out in Clause 2 of this Summons Letter.

3 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES

3.1

The Company's evaluation

The Company regrets to approach the bondholders

<<<

 in the Bond Issues with this temporarily waiver request. At the same time, the Company would like to emphasize that it is using its best efforts to strengthen its balance sheet and increase earnings through the mentioned Equity Transactions

<<<

, Furthermore, the Company has started to reduce earnings volatility by fixing more vessels on long term charter contracts, and the extensive newbuild program has now come to an end.

The Company has already received a temporary waiver of the

<<<

 Interest Coverage Ratio from its relevant banks (one bank is subject to committee approval on Friday 1 July), and the Company expects to be in compliance with all its covenants from 4Q11.

The Company believes a 0.50% one-time waiver fee should

<<<

 be a fair compensation for the bondholders of the Bonds to accept this temporarily covenant waiver.

The Company has engaged Pareto Securities AS and DnB NOR Markets as the Company's financial advisors (the "Advisors") with respect to the Proposal

<<<

. Accordingly, Bondholders may contact Pareto Securities AS hy Atle Sigmundstad at +47 22 87 87 75 or DnB NOR Markets at +47 22 01 77 46 for further information. The Advisors are acting solely for the Company and no-one else in connection with

<<<

 the Proposal No due diligence investigations have been carried out by the Advisors with respect to the Company and the Advisors expressly disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal ('including but not limited

<<<

 to the information contained herein),

3.2 Support from the Bondholders

Prior to this summons letter being distributed, the Company has informed the Bond Trustee that more than 50% of the Bondholders in each of the three Bond Issues will support

<<<

 the Proposal.

3.1

Exhibit 1: Background for Proposal (Provided bv the Company)

During 4Q10 and 1Q11, the offshore vessel market (in which the Company operates) saw reduced demand for

<<<

 offshore vessels resulting in low day rates, periodically below OPEX level, and low utilization on available vessels. This led to reduced EBITDA for these quarters, and while periodical fluctuations are normal, the levels of market unrest were

<<<

 unprecedented, also in a historical perspective, with low rig and subsea activity combined with numerous newbuilding deliveries. The adverse market conditions, combined with the Company's extensive newbuilding program completed in June 201

<<<

1 with the delivery of Havila Subsea, has caused the Company's interest costs relative to EBITDA to develop negatively during the last couple of financial quarters. Consequently, the Company expects to be in breach of the Interest Coverage Ratio

<<<

 covenant (min 1.65:1:00) from and including the financial quarter ending 30 June 2011.

On this background the Company is seeking approval from the bondholders in the Bond Issues to make a temporary waiver in each of the Bond Agreements.

As

<<<

 part of the Company's strategy to strengthen its balance sheet and earnings, the Company is currently in the process of raising approx. NOKm 358 of new equity. This will improve the Company's Interest Coverage Ratio and debt seivice capacity

<<<

 in general. However, as the Interest Coverage Ratio is measured on a four quarter rolling basis, the full effect of this transaction on such ratio will not be immediate even though the equity is raised now. The approval of the equity issue

<<<

 may depend on a temporary amendment of the Interest Coverage Ratio in the Bond Agreements.

New equity issue & acquisition o f vessels (the "Equity Transactions") The equity issue is expected to inject approx. NOKm 358 of new equity into the

<<<

 Company. Approx. NOKm 164 of this will be used to buy majority stakes in two vessels currently leased by the Company, approx. NOKm 52 to cancel a total return swap on the Company's own shares, and approx. NOKm 124 to assume ownership of 3 PSVs

<<<

, with the remaining as working capital.

The Advisors estimate that the new equity issue and accompanying transactions will improve the Interest Coverage Ratio by approx. 0.10-0.20 percentage points.

Below are the sources and uses of funds

<<<

 from the Equity Transactions, m equity amounts.

Note: all amounts in NOKm and on 100% basis

In total, the positive impact on the Company's EBITDA from the new equity issue and the corresponding acquisition is approx. NOKm 175 annually (removal of leasing

<<<

 costs plus additional vessel EBITDA), while the net interest expenses from the new debt is expected to be approx. NOKm 63 annually. There is favorable long term bank debt on all five vessels with loan repayment profiles from 8 to 18 years and

<<<

 final maturities in 2018 and 2021. All five vessels are on charter contracts with solid counterparts and with duration of 2 months to 5 years with extension options.

Cancellation o f Total Return Swap As part of the Equity Transactions, the

<<<

 Company intends to repurchase the shares that have been sold on a Total Return Swap to DnB NOR Bank, and sell them to investors. While the direct impact on the balance sheet is limited, this will effectively eliminate a NOKm 52 derivative exposure

<<<

 as well as a potential liability for the Company.

Market Update The market in which the Company operates is cyclical by nature. The supply vessel market was very weak during 4Q10 and 1Q11, with day rates for AHTS vessels and PSVs around operating

<<<

 costs. During late 1Q11 and through 2Q11, rates have improved significantly, with PSV rates at NOK 220,000/d - 240,000/d for charters of one to six months, compared to operating cost level of NOK 60,000/d.

The Company has several of its vessels

<<<

 fixed on medium and long-term charter contracts in the North Sea and international waters. The market balance has tightened significantly with periodical shortage of vessels in the North Sea basin. Even though the Company has a significant

<<<

 portion of the fleet on long term time charter contracts, the Company benefits from the improved markets through its vessels operating in the spot market. Year-to-date, the Company has secured five long-term contracts; the subsea vessel Havila

<<<

 Subsea was fixed for 18 months with Subsea 7, the two AHTS vessels Havila Mars and Havila Mercury were extended one additional year with Statoil, as was the rescue vessel Havila Runde. The AHTS vessel Havila Jupiter was awarded approximately

<<<

 three months contract with Total E&P.

The Company currently has a contract coverage of 84% for 2011 and 65% for 2012, measured by vessel days. Save for a 50% ownership stake in one newbuild PSV ordered against a 5year contract with Statoil

<<<

, the Company's has no other newbuildings on order. The average age of the Company's fleet is only 4.6 years, making it one of the most modern in the industry.

-6 -

Going forward, the Company expects a continued strong market through the

<<<

 summer. The Company expects the market to be driven by high activity in the international offshore markets and is confident that their modern high-specification fleet will benefit from the increased focus on safety and environment. The many

<<<

 long-term charter contracts awarded in the North Sea, Brazil and international regions the last six months supports the Company's positive market view. This being said, the offshore market is expected to remain volatile and future predications

<<<

 will always contain an element of uncertainty. The Interest Coverage Ratio is measured on a rolling basis over four quarters, and therefore significantly impacted by the very weak 4Q10 and 1Q11. Whereas the improvements in 2Q11 are significant

<<<

, the net impact is not sufficient to maintain the Interest Coverage Ratio above the requirement which was increased to 1.65x from 31 March 2011 (from previous level of 1.5Ox). However, the improvement in the market, the delivery of the final

<<<

 newbuild in June 2011, the new equity issue and the related acquisition of the five vessels described herein, are expected to have a significant positive impact on the Interest Coverage Ratio going forward. The Company expects to be in compliance

<<<

 with the 1.65:1.00 level as per end of 3Q11 on a stand-alone basis (but not on a four quarter rolling basis before 4Q11). The Company expects the aforementioned transactions to be approved by the Extraordinary General Meeting scheduled for

<<<

 19 July 2011, on which the Company's main shareholder has the required majority to approve the transactions and accompanying equity issue. For further information about the Company, please visit the Company's website www.havila.no. The Equity

<<<

 Transaction is further described in a presentation posted on the Company's website.
