 ASA Senior Secured Bond Issue 2009/2012
Oslo, 30 September 2011
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL (THE "SUMMONS")
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bond issue with ISIN NO 001 05

<<<

3847.3 (the "Bond Issue") with Blom ASA as issuer (the "Issuer").
All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the agreement, as amended, for the Bond Issue (the "Bond Agreement

<<<

") unless otheiwise stated.
The information regarding the operational and financial status o f the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information

<<<

.
1 BACKGROUND AND CORPORATE UPDATE On 23 March a Bondholders' meeting adopted resolutions pursuant to summons of 8 March 2011 regarding a proposed financial restructuring which comprised the issuing of a new oneyear bond loan of NOK 50 million

<<<

 and a rights issue of new shares, yielding gross proceeds of NOK 64 million. The restructuring which was carried out during this spring is regarded as a temporarily solution by the parties. Further, the parties saw it as beneficial to allow

<<<

 sufficient time to fine tune a more long term structure of the bonds. Consequently the Bondholder's Meeting 8 August 2011 granted the Issuer a waiver from the Bond Agreement Clause 13.5.2 and Clause 13.5.3, so that no Event of Default may be

<<<

 declared due to breach of these Clauses for the period from the date of the Bondholders' Meeting to 18 November 2011. The Issuer and the Bond Trustee and certain of its bondholders have thereafter been in a constructive dialogue to find a more

<<<

 long-term solution to the debt structure. The dialog included e.g. extension of the maturity of the bonds and refinement of the covenant structure. The parties are together of the opinion that a long-term solution which meets their joint needs

<<<

 has been found. In the current year the company has continued its measures to reduce the cost base, primarily through a reduction of the workforce. As result of the cost reductions the EBITDA in the second quarter 2011 improved to 15.5 percent

<<<

 from 7.8 percent same quarter 2010. Although the company is still exposed to markets, particularly in Southern Europe, that also in 2011 are

marked by uncertainty, the company is through its slimmer cost base and focus on new market segments better positioned to meet the partly challenging market situation. Bondholders representing more than 50% of

<<<

 the votes in the Bond Issue have committed to vote in favor of the proposal put forward in this summons.

THE PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING

In accordance with Clause 17.1 of the Bond Agreement the Company has approached the Bond Trustee to convene

<<<

 a Bondholders meeting in order to amend the Bond Agreement, pursuant to the authority given to the Bondholders' meeting under Clause 16.1 of the Bond Agreement. As both the Issuer and certain of the bondholders see it as beneficial to adopt

<<<

 a more long term structure of the bonds, The Company proposes as follows (the "Proposal"):

a) The definition of "Maturity Date" should be amended to extend the maturity of the Bonds to 25 September 2014.
b) Clause 10.2.1 should be amended

<<<

 so that the Borrower may redeem parts of the Bond Issue or the entire Bond Issue at any time at 100 % of par plus accrued interest on redeemed amount.
c) A new Clause 10.5 shall be added whereby the Borrower shall be obligated to redeem a fraction

<<<

 of the Bonds according to Clause 10.2.1 on the Interest Payment Date following a quarter where the Issuer's free cash and cash equivalents (i.e. cash in hand or amounts standing to the credit of any current and/or on deposit accounts with a

<<<

 bank that is freely and immediately available) (the "Free Cash") exceeds NOK 80,000,000 (the "Cash Sweep"). The amount which shall be redeemed according to the Cash Sweep shall equal the amount by which the Free Cash in the previous quarter

<<<

 exceeded NOK 80,000,000. If Free Cash has been increased as a consequence of an Equity Issue then Cash Sweep threshold shall simultaneously be increased by an amount equaling 50 (fifty) percent of the net proceeds raised under the Equity Issue

<<<

. The first Interest Payment date where the Issuer shall by obliged to make a Cash Sweep is in June 2012.
d) Clause 12.1 should be amended to read:
"The Issuer, or any party or parties over whom the Issuer has decisive influence, are not allowed

<<<

 to acquire and own the Bonds. However, the Issuer shall be allowed to redeem Bonds according to Clause 10.2.1 (Call Option).
e) Clause 13.2 ("Gearing Ratio") is deleted and substituted by an interest coverage ratio covenant defined as EBITDA

<<<

 to net interest costs which shall be a minimum of 1. In addition, the existing clause 9.7 (which entitles the Borrower to make a Payment in Kind ("PUC")) is amended to the effect that if the Borrower would be in breach of this covenant, the

<<<

 Company has the right to make the interest payment on the next Interest Payment Date as PIK, and thereby in effect not be in breach of this covenant.
2

However, the Borrower may only remedy a potential breach of this covenant, by making such

<<<

 payments in kind, twice during the term of the Loan. The ratio shall be measured on a twelve months rolling basis and for the first time by the end of 4lh quarter 2011. Determination of net interest cost will be made differently depending on

<<<

 when it is measured; it is determined as follows:

(i)

Determinations made from and including end of 4th quarter 2011 to and

including end of 3rd quarter 2012: Net interest cost shall exclude any

payments made as PIK.

(ii) Determinations

<<<

 made from and including end o f 4th quarter 2012 and for the rest of the term of the loan: Net interest cost shall include any payments made as PIK.

f) The existing Clause 13.5.3 (Book Equity ratio) is deleted in entirely.

3 EVALUATION OF

<<<

 THE PROPOSAL 3.1 The Issuer's evaluation The Issuer has previously evaluated various alternatives for a restructuring to meet its debt commitments and safeguard values for lenders. The current cash generation is not sufficient to meet the current

<<<

 debt amortization schedule. Consequently, a restructuring of the current amortization plan and covenants is required. The main objective with the proposed amendment is to safeguard values and secure a viable, long term financial platform for

<<<

 the Issuer. In the Issuer's view a more long term structure of the bond will benefit all stakeholders.
Correspondingly, the Issuer is of the opinion that the Proposal is to the advantage of the Bondholders, and that the objective is fully aligned

<<<

 with the interests of the Bondholders.
3.2 The Bond Trustee's evaluation The Bond Trustee puts forward the Proposal set out herein without any further evaluations or recommendation from the Bond Trustee.
The Bondholders must independently evaluate

<<<

, based on available information, whether the Restructuring is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences of the Restructuring.
