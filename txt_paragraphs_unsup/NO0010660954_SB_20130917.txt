Oslo, 17 September 2013

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - REQUEST FOR AMENDMENT
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned

<<<

 bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where Hoegh LNG Holding Ltd. (the "Issuer") is the issuer.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 28 September 2012 and made between the Bond Trustee

<<<

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever

<<<

 related to such information.

BACKGROUND

As described in the marketing information for the Bond Issue in September 2012, the Issuer at that time had 3 new floating storage and regasification units on order. Since then the Issuer has ordered

<<<

 a fourth unit. In order to ensure that the Issuer did not place any new orders for vessels or units without having secured satisfactory equity and/or third party financing, it was agreed to include the following restriction on the incurrence

<<<

 of or commitment to new capital expenditures in Clause 13.4(j) of the Bond Agreement:

"Incurrence o f capital expenditures

The Group shall not incur or commit to any capital expenditures after the date o f this Bond Agreement (such as ordering

<<<

 new vessels/units) unless the Issuer's Pro-forma Equity Ratio subsequent to such incurrence is equal to or higher than 30% (tested on the next Quarter Date). "

Pro-forma Equity Ratio is in Clause 1.1 of the Bond Agreement defined as the ratio

<<<

 of Book Equity to Pro-forma Total Assets, where Pro-forma Total Assets is defined as follows:

"Pro-forma Total Assets" means, at any time, Total Assets plus, to the extent not included in the Total Assets pursuant to GAAP, any capital expenditures

<<<

 incurred or committed after the date o f this Bond Agreement (except fo r any capital expenditures incurred or committed in respect o f the three vessels under the newbuilding program o f the Group in place at the date o f this Bond Agreement

<<<

). "

The Issuer met this test when the fourth unit was ordered

<<<

.

In connection with the tender for a time charter of LNG vessels to a major energy company, the Issuer is considering entering into a bareboat charter arrangement with an unrelated third party for such LNG vessels. The unrelated third party

<<<

 would enter into the respective newbuilding contracts, and upon delivery to the Company the vessels would be employed under the long term charter with the energy company. The obligation to pay the bareboat hire is intended to coincide with

<<<

 the commencement of the hire payment under the time charter, which is not expected to take place until 2017. Since the bareboat charter would be considered a finance lease, the present value of the future bareboat payments during the minimum

<<<

 term of the bareboat charter would in accordance with IFRS be capitalized as an asset on the Issuer's balance sheet upon delivery o f the vessels in 2017.

The Issuer believes that the contemplated project and similar projects could bring benefits

<<<

 to the Issuer, its shareholders and its creditors, as they could create cash flows and generate profits to the Issuer from long term time charterer contracts with strong counterparties. However, as a bareboat charter would be treated under

<<<

 IFRS as a commitment to incur capital expenditures, the Issuer will only be able to undertake such a project if it complies with the test set out in Clause 13.4(j) of the Bond Agreement, even though the Issuer is not acquiring a vessel or a

<<<

 unit. According to the Issuer and the managers o f the Bond Issue, this test was designed to limit the incurrence of near term capital expenditures, and not meant to include a future long term bareboat lease. Unfortunately, the test in its

<<<

 present form creates an unintended restriction on the Issuer's ability to enter into bareboat charters that does not require any upfront equity commitments or additional financing, and where substantially all the capital expenditures would

<<<

 be incurred after the Maturity Date for the Bonds.

On this basis, the Issuer wishes to request that the Bondholders' Meeting agrees to certain adjustments to the Bond Agreement to allow the Group to enter into certain permitted bareboat charters

<<<

 to the extent that the Group on a pro forma basis would have a minimum pro-forma equity ratio of no less than 25% of pro-forma total assets, when adding the capital value of the finance or capital lease(s) with forward start to the book total

<<<

 assets (such pro-forma equity ratio is not to be confused with the above mentioned Pro-forma Equity Ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, when entering into a bareboat charter and accompanying lease, the Issuer will not be required to comply

<<<

 with the capital expenditures covenant in Clause 13.4(j) of the Bond Agreement, but must comply with this new covenant. No other changes will be made to the financial covenants set out in the Bond Agreement.

In order to qualify as such a permitted

<<<

 bareboat charter, the bareboat charter arrangements will have to comply with the following criteria:

(i)

before the bareboat charter becomes effective and binding for the Group, the Group shall

have entered into a time charter with a minimum

<<<

 fixed term that ends minimum 5 years after

the Maturity Date; and

(ii)

such time charter shall be entered into with a counterparty that either:

(a) has a credit rating o f at either BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Baa

<<<

3 or higher by Moody's Investors Service Limited or BBB(low) or higher by Fitch Ratings Ltd.; or

(b) is a Subsidiary of a company with a credit rating as set out in paragraph (a) above.

In addition, the Bond Agreement would exclude any capital

<<<

 expenditures that the Issuer commits to incur in the future upon entering into such permitted bareboat charters from the definition of Pro forma Total Assets (incurrence of such capital expenditures to be tested separately, as outlined above

<<<

 and below).
