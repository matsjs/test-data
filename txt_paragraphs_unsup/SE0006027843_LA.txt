The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Group Company will, sell or otherwise dispose of all or some of the shares in any Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or a Group Company's assets or operations, including

<<<

, for the avoidance of doubt, any Property or any part of any Property, to any person not being the Issuer or any of its whollyowned Subsidiaries unless such disposal is made on customary arm's length terms at fair market value and constitutes

<<<

 a Permitted Partial Divestment which does not have a Material Adverse Effect. The shares in any of the Swedish Pledged Subsidiaries or the Finnish Pledged Subsidiaries may at no point be disposed of unless such disposal would take the form

<<<

 of a merger between any of the Issuer, the Swedish Pledged Subsidiaries or the Finnish Pledged Subsidiaries and such would not result in an Event of Default.
Negative pledge
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries

<<<

, create or allow to subsist, retain, provide, prolong or renew any guarantee or security over any of its/their assets (present or future) to secure any loan or other indebtedness, provided however that the Group Companies have a right to retain

(b) the Interest Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.25.
For the purpose of curing a deficiency in the ratio referred to under Clause 11.7.1(b) above, the Issuer shall after the expiry of each Relevant Period have the right to reduce the Interest Expense

<<<

 for the purpose of the calculation of the ratio of the Interest Coverage Ratio for such Relevant Period (an "Equity Cure"), provided that (i) prior to the Equity Cure, the Interest Coverage Ratio is not below 1.00 and (ii) the amount used to

<<<

 reduce the Interest Expense is at least 10,000,000 SEK (the "Cure Amount") and shall be obtained in cash by the Issuer:
(a) before the delivery of the Compliance Certificate relating to the expired Relevant Period; and
(b) as (i) new share

<<<

 capital, (ii) unconditional shareholders' contribution or (iii) Shareholder Loans.
When re-calculating the Interest Expense in relation to the Interest Coverage Ratio pursuant to an Equity Cure, the Interest Expense shall be reduced by an amount

<<<

 corresponding to the amount with which the Interest Expense would have been reduced if the Cure Amount was applied towards a SEK by SEK reduction of the Net Interest Bearing Debt for the entire Relevant Period calculated pro forma and, when

<<<

 making the SEK by SEK reduction, based on the weighted average (blended rate) Interest Expense for the Net Interest Bearing Debt for such period. For the avoidance of doubt, such pro forma calculation may be included when calculating the Interest

<<<

 Expense for subsequent Relevant Periods having overlapping interim periods with the Relevant Period which first included the pro forma calculation, however only taking into account such overlapping interim periods.
The Cure Amount shall be

<<<

 applied towards repayment of the Bonds. Such repayment shall be at the Nominal Amount pro rata to each Bond and shall be made at the nearest Interest Payment Date after which the Cure Amount has been obtained by the Issuer. The repayment of

<<<

 the Bonds shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent, where such notice shall state the relevant Interest Payment Date on which the repayment shall be made, the prepayment

<<<

 Bond on the First Amortisation Date and thereafter annually on the anniversary of the First Amortisation Date (an "Amortisation Date") unless the Issuer has, during the 12 months preceding an Amortisation Date, repurchased and cancelled Bonds

<<<

 to a corresponding aggregate amount. The repayment of the Bonds shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent, where such notice shall state the relevant First Amortisation

not only some, of the Bonds due for payment immediately or at such later date as the Agent

<<<

 (such later date not falling later than twenty (20) Business Days from the date on

which the Agent made such declaration), if:

<<<

 written request).
(e) Cross-acceleration/default:
a) any Financial Indebtedness of any Group Company is not paid when due as extended by any originally applicable grace period, or is declared to be or otherwise becomes due and payable prior

<<<

 it does not apply to any Financial Indebtedness owed to a Group Company.

14.2

Termination for payment prematurely

<<<

 on the grounds mentioned in Clause 14.1(d) may only

occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material

Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's

declaration

<<<

. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not

prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Clause 14.1(f).

14.3

If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court

<<<

 of law or a government

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.

14.4

The Issuer is obligated to inform

<<<

 the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 14.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur,

provided

<<<

 that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under

no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in

Clause 14.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent, provide

<<<

 the Agent with

31

14.5 14.6
14.7 14.8 14.9 14.10

details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 14.1 and provide the Agent with all documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 14 .
The Issuer is only obligated

<<<

 to inform the Agent according to Clause 14.4 if informing the Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with NASDAQ

<<<

 OMX Stockholm or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obligated to either seek the approval from NASDAQ OMX Stockholm or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be

<<<

 able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 14.4.
If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a default under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 14.1, the Agent shall decide, within

<<<

 twenty (20) Business Days of the day of notification or determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the Agent has decided not to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that there

<<<

 exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the provisions in Clause 16 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall

<<<

 promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible

<<<

 date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default and whether such event has a Material Adverse

<<<

 Effect.
If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 16 (Decisions by Holders), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated

<<<

. The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested

<<<

 by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 14, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover

<<<

 the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 14 without relevant decision by the Agent or following instructions from the

<<<

 Holders' pursuant to Clause 16 (Decisions by Holders).
If the Bonds are declared due and payable, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to 105.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount or, if the Bonds are declared due and

<<<

 payable on or after the First Call Date, at the applicable Call Option Amount.

 reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.

15.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 15.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way

bearing account on behalf of the Holders and the other

<<<

 interested parties. The Agent shall

arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with this Clause 15 as soon as reasonably

practicable.

15.4
