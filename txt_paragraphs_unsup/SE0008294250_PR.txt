RISK FACTORS

Investments in bonds

<<<

 always involve a certain degree of risk. In this section a number o f risk factors are described, both general risks attributable to Corem and its subsidiaries' ("Corem Group") operations and main risks linked to the Bonds in their capacity

<<<

 of financial instruments. A number of factors affect and may come to affect Corem Group's operations, result, financial position and the Bonds. The intention is to describe risks that are related to Corem Group's operations and thus also Corem

<<<

's ability to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.

Before making a decision to invest in Bonds, any potential investors should carefully consider the risk factors outlined below, as well as any other relevant

<<<

 information such as the final Terms and Conditions of the Bonds and any public available financial and other information of Corem. In addition, an investor must, alone or together with its financial and other types of advisors, engage in a

<<<

 general evaluation of external facts and general information about the property market and property companies from its own perspective. An investor should have adequate knowledge to evaluate the risk factors as well as sufficient financial

<<<

 strength to bear these risks. The below risks are not ranked in order of importance. The risks presented herein are not exhaustive as additional risk factors which are currently unknown or which are currently not deemed to be material may also

<<<

 affect Corem Group's future operations, result and financial position and thus also Corem's ability to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.

1.1

RISKS RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS

Macroeconomic factors
The real

<<<

 estate market is to a large extent affected by macroeconomic factors such as the general economic development, growth, employment, level of production of new premises, changes in infrastructure, population growth, inflation and interest rate

<<<

 levels. Economic growth affects the employment rate, which is an essential basis for supply and demand on the rental market and consequently impacts vacancy rates and rental levels.
Inflation expectations have an impact on the interest rate

<<<

 and thus affect the net interest income. In the long term, interest rate changes will have significant impact on Corem Group's earnings and cash flow. The inflation also impacts Corem Group's costs. Furthermore, changes in interest rates and

<<<

 inflation also impact yield requirements and by that, the market value of the properties' market value.
A number of Corem Group's lease agreements are wholly or partially linked to the consumer price index (CPI), i.e. the lease agreements are

<<<

 wholly or partially adjusted in accordance with the inflation. There is a risk that Corem Group is not able to negotiate lease agreements that wholly or partially compensate the inflation. If Corem Group's costs increase more due to inflation

<<<

 than Corem Group's compensation due to index adjustments, this would have a negative impact on Corem Group's earnings.

5

Higher vacancy rates and interest rates, increased costs and lower rental rates could have a significant negative impact

<<<

 on Corem Group's business, financial position and earnings.
Geographical risks
The supply and demand of properties and by that, the return on real estate investments differs between geographical markets and may develop differently within the

<<<

 geographical markets. Corem Group has a well-diversified property portfolio with properties in different geographical markets. However, there is a risk that demand does decline on most or all geographical markets which could have a significant

<<<

 impact on Corem Group's business.
Rental income and rental development
Decreased occupancy rates and rental rates will, regardless of reason, affect Corem Group's earnings negatively. The risk for great fluctuations in vacancies and loss of

<<<

 rental income increases, the more single large tenants a real-estate company has. There is a risk that Corem Group's larger tenants do not renew or extend their lease agreements when these have expired, which in the long term could lead to

<<<

 a decrease in rental income and an increase in vacancies.
Corem Group is dependent on that the tenants pay their rent on time. Corem Group's earnings could be impacted negatively if tenants stop their payments, or do not fulfil their obligations

<<<

 in other ways.
Operating and maintenance costs
Operating costs consist mainly of tariff-based costs such as costs for electricity, sanitation, water and heating. Many of these products and services can only be bought from one service provider

<<<

, which may affect the price. The costs for electricity and heating have the largest impact on the result. To the extent increases in such costs are not compensated by terms in lease agreements, or by renegotiation of lease agreements in order

<<<

 to increase the rent, Corem Group's net operating income may be impacted negatively.
Maintenance costs are attributable to actions that intend to maintain the property's long term standard in order to comply with market, governmental and legal

<<<

 requirements. Corem Group has a plan for the implementation of maintenance measures that are deemed necessary. Unexpected and large renovation needs may however affect Corem Group negatively.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that Corem Group

<<<

's counterparties may not fulfil their obligations to Corem Group. The financial position of Corem Group's customers may deteriorate to such extent that they become unable to perform their financial obligations towards Corem Group. It might

<<<

 be the case that Corem Group's counterparties will not be able to perform
6

their obligations towards Corem Group. Furthermore, credit risk within Corem Group's financial operations arises for instance from excess cash placements, entering

<<<

 of interestrate swap agreements and obtaining long- and short-term financing under credit agreements or capital market financing. Corem Group's business and earnings could be impacted negatively if Corem Group's counterparties do not fulfil

<<<

 their obligations to Corem Group.
Interest risk
Corem Group's business is mainly financed, in excess of equity, by borrowings from credit institutions and the bond market. Corem Group's capital structure results in interest expenses being the

<<<

 main costs item. The interest rate risk is the risk of a negative effect on the result and cash flow due to changes in the market interest rate. The interest expense is mainly affected by the from time to time applicable level of market interest

<<<

 rates but also by Corem Group's strategy as regards hedging the interest rates. The market interest rates for long-term interest periods are mainly affected by the expected inflation rate, where pricing of bonds and certificates are determined

<<<

 by supply and demand. The interest rates for short-term interest periods are mainly affected by the Swedish National Bank's (Sw. Riksbankens) actions and decisions relating to its repurchase rate (Sw. reporäntan), which is a monetary policy

<<<

 rate instrument. Increased market interest rates over time will also increase interest expenses for Corem Group, which means that Corem Group's business, earnings and financial position could be adversely affected.
Refinancing risks
Refinancing

<<<

 risk is the risk that necessary financing may not be obtained, or could only be obtained at significantly increased costs. Although Corem today estimates that the refinancing risk is low there is still a risk that future refinancing is not

<<<

 possible at all, or is not possible on terms that are attractive for Corem. In case Corem Group is unable to refinance existing facilities or obtain additional financing at market terms, as a result of an insufficient supply in the capital

<<<

 market or for any other reason, it could adversely affect Corem Group's business, financial position and earnings.
Changes in value of interest derivatives
All of Corem Group's credit agreements have floating interest rates. As part of managing

<<<

 the interest rate risk, Corem Group uses interest derivatives, mainly interest swaps and interest caps. The interest derivatives are recorded continuously at actual value in the balance sheet and stated as value changes in the income statement

<<<

. As market interest rates change, a theoretical over- or undervalue of the interest derivatives occur but have no impact on the cash flow. The derivatives protect against higher interest rate levels, but also imply that the market value of

<<<

 Corem Group's interest derivatives decreases if the market interest rates decrease, which will have a negative impact on Corem Group's financial position and earnings.
7

Changes in value of properties
Corem Group's real estate investments

<<<

 are recorded in the balance sheet at actual value and the value changes are recorded in the income statement. Unrealized value changes have no impact on the cash flow. Corem Group performs a valuation of the entire property holdings quarterly

<<<

. 20-30 per cent of the valuations are performed externally and the remaining part by Corem Group itself. This means that each property in the portfolio is valued externally over a rolling 12-month period. Corem Group's properties' loan to value

<<<

 ratio was 52 per cent as of 31 December 2015.
The value of the properties is affected by a number of factors, partly by property specific factors such as rent levels, rental rates and operating costs and partly by market specific factors such

<<<

 as yield demands and cost of capital that are derived from comparable transactions on the real estate market. Property related deteriorations such as lower rental income and increased vacancies, as well as market specific factors such as demand

<<<

 for higher return on investments can cause Corem Group to write down the actual value of its investment properties, which could have a negative impact on Corem Group's earnings and financial position. If the value of the properties shows a

<<<

 negative development, other things being equal, the surplus value between the assets and the debt decreases. Less surplus value, i.e. high loan-to-property-value ratio, may imply that the probability of recovering the full investment amount

<<<

 in the Bonds in an event of default situation is lower than in a situation with high surplus value, i.e. low loan-to-property-value ratio. However, despite a positive surplus value, regardless of size, there is a risk that all or parts of the

<<<

 invested amount in the Bonds cannot be recovered in an event of default situation.
Transactions
All investments are associated with uncertainties, such as loss of tenants, environmental circumstances and technical problems. Prior to an investment

<<<

 an evaluation is performed that aims to identify, and if possible, to reduce the risks that can be associated with the investment. There is a risk that future business activities or properties that are added through acquisitions do not result

<<<

 in the anticipated positive impact and, as such, may have a negative impact on Corem Group's earnings and financial position. Further, there is a risk that a seller, in connection with an acquisition, may not fulfil its obligations due to financial

<<<

 difficulties, which may affect Corem Group's possibility to bring forward claims on compensation according to contracted indemnities or warranties (which may also be subject to limitations in amount and time).
Project risks
The operations of

<<<

 Corem Group also comprise property development projects. When developing property certain risks arise. Larger projects may entail major investments which may lead to an increased credit risk should tenants be unable to fulfil their obligations

<<<

 towards Corem Group, and Corem Group in turn would be unable to find other tenants for the premises in question, or the demand or the price for the property alter
8

during the project. Projects may also be delayed or may entail higher costs

<<<

 than foreseen which may lead to increased costs or decreased earnings. Further, Corem Group is dependent on receiving the proper authority decisions and permits to carry out property development projects. In the event of the above, there is

<<<

 a risk that this will have a negative impact on Corem Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
Risks regarding the acquisition of Estancia Logistik AB
Corem has on 31 May 2016 acquired all shares in Estancia Logistik AB (publ).

<<<

 The acquisition was financed by external bank loans of approximately SEK 800 million, issuing of 588,681 preferential shares in Corem, sale of 5.5 million common shares of Series A in Klövern AB, a vendor note in the amount of SEK 238 million

<<<

 which will be repaid shortly after completion (the note refers to the sale of a property company to the Sellers of Estancia Logistik) and Corem has assumed the responsibility for a bond that Estancia Logistik AB has issued. There is a risk

<<<

 that Corem will not have sufficient funds at the time of repayment to make the required repayments of the external loans or the bond.
The acquisition leads to that Corem's debt to equity ratio increased, which may lead to an increased refinancing

<<<

 risk. Please see above regarding Refinancing risks.
The acquisition may also lead to unpredicted costs due to unknown risks which were not disclosed during the due diligence or additional costs in connection with the acquisition or integration

<<<

 procedure.
Prepayment
If a change of control or delisting occurs the Corem Group may have to prepay its loans to creditors according to external bank loans or other bonds. There is a risk that Corem will not have sufficient funds at the time

<<<

 of such prepayment to make the required repayments of the external loans or the bonds.
Executive management, staff and operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of incurring losses due to inadequate procedures and/or irregularities. Adequate

<<<

 internal control, administrative system adapted for the purposes, skills development and access to reliable valuation and risk models are a good basis for guaranteeing the operational safety.
Corem Group's employees' knowledge, experience and

<<<

 commitment are important for Corem Group's future development. Corem Group would be affected negatively if a number of its employees would leave Corem Group at the same time, or if Corem Group's administrative security and control would fail

<<<

.
9

Competition
Corem Group acts in an industry that is exposed to competition. Corem Group's future competitive opportunities are dependent on, among other things, Corem Group's ability to be at the forefront and respond quickly to existing

<<<

 and future market needs. Corem Group may therefore be forced to make cost demanding investments, to restructure or to make price reductions in order to adapt to a new competition situation. Increased competition could adversely affect Corem

<<<

 Group's business and earnings.
Technical risks
Property investments are associated with technical risks. Technical risk is defined as the risk associated with the technical management of the property, such as the risk for construction errors

<<<

, other latent defects and deficiencies, damages (for example by fire or other force of nature) and pollution. By investing in properties with sound technical standard, either newly developed or recently renovated properties, the technical risk

<<<

 can be reduced. However, it cannot be ruled out that significant unforeseen costs may occur. If such technical problems would occur they may cause significant increased costs for Corem Group and adversely affect Corem Group's earnings and financial

<<<

 position.
Legal risks
Corem Group's business is regulated by and must be conducted in accordance with several laws and regulations, detailed development plans, building standards, security regulations, etcetera. Even if Corem Group's business

<<<

 is conducted in accordance with its interpretation of laws and regulations, it cannot be excluded that the interpretation or implementation thereof may be incorrect or may change in the future. Corem Group may also be required to apply for

<<<

 various permits and registrations with municipalities and authorities in order to pursue property development. There is a risk that Corem Group will not be granted necessary permits or other decisions for its business activities or that such

<<<

 permits or decisions are appealed, which may result in increased costs and delay in planned development of properties or otherwise have negative impact on the conduct and development of its business.
New laws or regulations, or changes concerning

<<<

 the application of existing laws or regulations that are applicable to Corem Group's business activities or the tenants' business activities could have a negative impact on Corem Group's earnings and financial position.
In June 2014, a parliamentary

<<<

 committee proposed changes to the interest deduction limitation rules. The committee proposed, as a main alternative, a notional deduction amounting to 25 per cent of the taxable profit and, as an alternative proposal, a limitation of deduction

<<<

 corresponding to 20 per cent of the company's EBIT and where the current interest deduction limitation rules would remain. To finance the reform, a restriction on the use of tax losses carried forward was proposed whereby tax losses carried

<<<

 forward would
10

be reduced with 50 per cent. In April 2015 it was announced that the proposal will be revised and that new rules on interest deductions will not be enacted before January 2017.
In June 2015 the Swedish Government assigned

<<<

 a committee to investigate if it is necessary to introduce new rules on limitations on tax-exempt disposals of shares in companies holding real estate and, if considered necessary, to propose new legislation. Stamp duty liability in respect

<<<

 of such indirect real estate transactions will also be subject to the committee's review. The results of the review are to be presented on March 31, 2017.
Moreover, there are significant differences in the political parties' view on the size

<<<

 and occurrence of taxes and subsidies. It cannot be excluded that tax rates are changed in the future or that other changes of regulations occur which affect the ownership of real estate properties or real estate transactions. If any of the

<<<

 changes described above would materialize, it could have a negative impact on Corem Group's business, earnings and financial position.
Accounting risks
Corem Group's accounting, financial reporting and internal control is affected by current

<<<

 applicable accounting principles. There is a risk that future changes in accounting principles or the application thereof may affect Corem Group's earnings and financial position.
Environmental risks
Property management and property development

<<<

 have an environmental impact. Corem Group has adopted an environmental policy plan and works actively with environmental issues. The Environmental Code states that everyone who has conducted a business operation that has contributed to pollution

<<<

 also has a responsibility for after-treatment of the property. If the responsible person cannot carry out or pay for the after-treatment of a polluted property, the person who has acquired the property is liable for after-treatment provided

<<<

 that the buyer at the time of the acquisition knew of or should have discovered the pollution. This means that claims, under certain conditions, may be raised against Corem Group for soil remediation or for remediation concerning presence or

<<<

 suspicion of pollution in soil, water areas or ground water, in order to put the property in a condition pursuant to the Environmental Code. Corem Group has not performed any exhaustive investigation of possible environmental pollution in the

<<<

 property portfolio, but estimates that neither existing nor previous business activities at the properties have entailed any environmental risks that substantially could affect Corem Group's financial position. However, there is no absolute

<<<

 certainty in this respect and any future demands regarding environmental risks may affect Corem Group's earnings and financial position negatively.
11

Tax risks and deficit deductions
Changes in legislation regarding company and property

<<<

 taxation, VAT, as well as other government charges and contributions, may affect the conditions for Corem Group's business activities. There is a risk that these charges and contributions will not remain unchanged in the future, for example

<<<

 changes in the possibility for depreciation for tax purposes and tax deductions on interest costs could adversely affect Corem Group's result. Corem Group has accumulated tax losses. Changes to the ownership of Corem resulting in a change of

<<<

 control of Corem can lead to limitations (in whole or in part) of the possibility to use tax losses carried forward. Also, changes in legislation or case law can affect the possibility to use such tax losses carried forward. It cannot be ruled

<<<

 out that tax rates will change in the future, or that there are other changes to the governmental system that will impact property ownership or real estate transactions. Any change in the tax legislation or practice that entails changes to

<<<

 corporate tax rate, changed possibilities for tax depreciations, possibilities to use tax losses carried forward or limitations on taxexempt disposals of shares in companies holding real estate may lead to a changed tax situation in the future

<<<

 for Corem Group and may have a negative impact on Corem Group's earnings.

Disputes
Corem Group has no ongoing tax or civil court cases, except in respect of claim for rental payments.
A negative outcome of any rental or future disputes could

<<<

 have a negative impact on Corem Group's business, financial position and earnings.

1.2

RISKS RELATING TO THE BONDS

Liquidity risks
Corem cannot assure that a liquid trading of the Bonds will occur and be maintained. Corem will apply for

<<<

 listing of the Bonds at Nasdaq Stockholm after the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw. Finansinspektionen) approves a prospectus for this purpose. There is no assurance that the Bonds will be approved for trading. Even if a Bond is

<<<

 admitted to trading on the regulated market there is a risk that a demand for and trading with the Bonds will not exist. In addition, following listing of the Bonds, the liquidity and trading price of the Bonds may vary as a result of numerous

<<<

 factors, including general market movements and irrespective of Corem's performance. This may entail that a Bondholder cannot sell his or her Bonds at the desired time or at a yield which is comparable to similar investments that have an existing

<<<

 and functioning secondary market. A lack of liquidity in the market may have a negative impact on the market value of the Bonds.

12

Credit risk
Investments in bonds in general entail a certain degree of risk for investors, including the

<<<

 risk of losing the value of the entire investment. Investors who invest in the Bonds become exposed to a credit risk in relation to Corem and the Bonds carry a, relatively, high interest, which is to be regarded as a compensation for the, relatively

<<<

, higher risk an investor carries compared to an investment in Swedish government bonds. The investor's ability to receive payment under the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds is dependent on Corem Group's ability to fulfil its payment obligations

<<<

, which in its turn is dependent on the development of Corem Group's business activities and its financial position. Corem Group's financial position is affected by several risk factors, of which a number have been discussed above.
An increased

<<<

 credit risk may cause that the Bonds will be attached with a higher risk premium by the market, which would affect the Bonds' value and price in the secondary market negatively. Another aspect of the credit risk is that a deteriorating financial

<<<

 position may cause Corem Group's credit rating to decrease, which could negatively affect the possibility for Corem to refinance the Bonds at maturity.
Priority rights and structural subordination and dependency on subsidiaries
The Bonds constitute

<<<

 direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Corem and shall rank at least pari passu with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Corem. This means that a Bondholder in the event of Corem's liquidation, company

<<<

 reorganization or bankruptcy, normally would receive payment after any prioritised creditors (e.g. lenders or investors that have the benefit of security) have received payment. The Terms and Conditions of the Bonds do not include a so called

<<<

 "negative pledge" undertaking and hence Corem may post security to other lenders, including for the benefit of holders of bonds issued by Corem in the future or for the benefit of other lenders to the Corem Group. Such security would not secure

<<<

 the Bonds.
Each investor should be aware of the fact that there is a risk that the person that invests in the Bonds may lose the whole, or parts of, his or her investment in the event of Corem's liquidation, bankruptcy or company reorganization

<<<

.
Since Corem is a parent company to Corem Group's property owning companies, Corem is dependent upon receiving dividends and group contributions from its subsidiaries to be able to fulfil its obligations under the Terms and Conditions. The

<<<

 Bonds are not guaranteed by any of these subsidiaries or any other company or person. This means that the Bonds are structurally subordinated to any indebtedness raised in any of the property owning subsidiaries, and so the creditors of such

<<<

 indebtedness have priority over the Bondholders to the assets and revenue generated in the subsidiaries. The Terms and Conditions of the Bonds do not include any restriction (other than indirectly by way of the interest cover ratio and the

<<<

 equity ratio covenant) on the ability of Corem to incur additional indebtedness, neither in Corem nor in any of the subsidiaries.
13

Corem Group has within the framework of its financing raised loans from credit institutions and has thereby

<<<

 pledged mortgage deeds in certain properties and shares in some of Corem Group's property owning subsidiaries. Corem also intends to continue seeking appropriate and attractive financing and may in connection thereto grant security for such

<<<

 financing (which may include secured capital markets financing). The issuance of secured capital markets financing may negatively affect the liquidity, value and price of the Bonds in the secondary market.
Prepayment risk, Change of Control

<<<

, Delisting etc.
Corem has a right under the Terms and Conditions to redeem all outstanding Bonds three months prior to the Final Maturity Date. There is a risk that the market value of the Bonds is higher than the price that Corem may be entitled

<<<

 to redeem the Bonds for. However, an early redemption can never be made at an amount lower than a nominal amount of 100 per cent.
According to the Terms and Conditions, the Bondholders have the right to request prepayment of their Bonds should

<<<

 a Change of Control Event, Delisting Event or a Listing Failure, as defined in the Terms and Conditions, occur. Corem may further be obliged to redeem the Bonds if it is, or becomes impossible or unlawful, for Corem to perform any of the provisions

<<<

 of the Terms and Conditions or if the obligations under the Terms and Conditions are not legal, valid, binding or enforceable. There is a risk that Corem will not have sufficient funds at the time of such prepayment to make the required prepayment

<<<

 of the Bonds.
The Bondholders' right to request prepayment in case of a Change of Control or Delisting Event does, however, not apply if a company, the shares of which are listed on Nasdaq Stockholm or any other regulated market, acquires or

<<<

 takes control over Corem or the delisting is a result of such company's public offer for the shares in Corem. Thus, there is a risk that a change of control or delisting occurs without the Bondholders having a right of prepayment of the Bonds

<<<

.
Euroclear
The Bonds will be connected to Euroclear Sweden AB's ("Euroclear") account-based system, why no physical bonds have been or will be issued. Clearing and settlement at trading with the Bonds, as well as payment of interest and redemption

<<<

 of principal amounts will be performed within Euroclear's account-based system. The investors are therefore dependent on the functionality of Euroclear's account-based system.
Bondholders' meeting
The Terms and Conditions of the Bonds include

<<<

 certain conditions regarding the Bondholders' meeting, or a Written Procedure, that can be held in order to resolve matters relating to the Bondholders' interests. The Terms and Conditions allow for stated
14

majorities to bind all Bondholders

<<<

, including Bondholders who have not participated in and voted at the actual Bondholders' Meeting, or Written Procedure, or have voted differently than the required majority, to decisions that have been taken at a duly convened and conducted

<<<

 Bondholders' meeting.
Bondholders' representation
In accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Agent represents all Bondholders in all matters relating to the Bonds, unless the majority requirements in the Terms and Conditions are observed

<<<

. However, this does not rule out the possibility that the Bondholders, in certain situations, could bring their own action against Corem, which may affect an acceleration of the Bonds or other actions against Corem negatively. To enable the

<<<

 Agent to represent the Bondholders in court, the Bondholders may have to submit a written power of attorney for legal proceedings. The failure of a Bondholder to submit such a power of attorney could negatively impact the enforcement of the

<<<

STATUS OF THE BONDS

<<<

 Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Bonds each initial Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement.
The nominal

<<<

 amount of each Bond is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of hundred per cent of the Nominal Amount.
Provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from

<<<

 such issue, the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the Nominal Amount and

<<<

 the Final Maturity Date applicable to the Initial Bonds shall apply to Subsequent Bonds. The price of the Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. Each Subsequent Bond shall entitle its holder

<<<

 to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Bonds.
The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and

<<<

 without any preference among them, and at least pari passu with all other direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer other than those mandatorily preferred by law.

34

2.6

The Bonds are freely transferable

<<<

 but the Bondholders may be subject to purchase or

transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable, under local laws to which a

Bondholder may be subject. Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such

restrictions at its

<<<

 own cost and expense.

2.7

No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public

offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or

other material relating to the Issuer

<<<

 or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden,

where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and

observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the

Bonds

<<<

.

3.

USE OF PROCEEDS

The Issuer shall use the proceeds from the issue of the Bonds, less the costs and expenses incurred by the Issuer in connection with the issue of the Bonds, for repayment of the Issuer's outstanding bonds maturing on
