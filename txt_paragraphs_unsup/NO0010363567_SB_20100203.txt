's Meeting
1. BACKGROUND
1.1 Acceleration of the Loan and collection of the Outstanding Loan
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"/"Norsk Tillitsmann") is appointed loan trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned loan

<<<

 with ISIN NO 001 036356.7 (the "Loan"), established under the loan agreement dated 27 April 2007 (the "Loan Agreement") with Interoil Exploration and Production ASA as borrower (the "Borrower").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have

<<<

 the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement unless otherwise stated in this summons.
The Borrower failed to make repayment of the instalment of the Loan on the Payment Date falling on 5 May 2009, as required by Clause 10.1 of the Loan

<<<

 Agreement.
This was, prima facie, an Event of Default under Clause 15.1 (a) of the Loan Agreement, which was not remedied in accordance with Clause 15.1 (a), and the Loan was declared by NTM to be in default on 22 May 2009.
Pursuant to a creditors

<<<

 agreement dated 12 June 2009, certain bondholders, who together hold Bonds representing in excess of 2/3 of the Outstanding Loan, agreed on certain terms to a "standstill" with respect to their claims under the Loan Agreement (the "Creditors

<<<

' Agreement").
In particular, the intention of the Creditors' Agreement was to achieve a satisfactory voluntary arrangement for (i) the sale of the Loan Security and (ii) the repayment of the Loan, in consideration of which an extension for

<<<

 repayment of the Loan and a grace period was granted, whereby collection under the Loan Agreement was temporarily suspended.

N O RSK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
The Creditors' Agreement was terminatedlM l21 December 2009, its purpose not having been fulfilled, and the temporary

<<<

 suspension of the collection of the Outstanding Loan was lifted. In particular, the Borrower has failed to make repayment of the Loan which remains in default.

The amounts due under the Loan Agreement were declared to be immediately due and

<<<

 payable on 23 December 2009, after NTM received an instruction to declare such a default by a majority of the Bondholders collectively representing 72.3% of the Outstanding Loan under the Loan Agreement (the "Instructing Bondholders").

Following

<<<

 consultation with and the instructions from the Instructing Bondholders, NTM has filed a petition for the enforced sale of the Loan Security. NTM is also considering filing a petition for the bankruptcy of the Borrower on the grounds that the

<<<

 Borrower is no longer willing and capable to protect the interests of its creditors, either directly or through providing appropriate instructions to its subsidiaries, including Interoil Exploration and Production Latin America AS.

1.2 Filing

<<<

 for enforcement proceedings

Pursuant to an instruction letter dated 13 January 2010 (the "Instruction Letter") issued on behalf of the Instructing Bondholders, NTM was instructed to instruct or procure the instruction of Advokatfirmaet Thommessen

<<<

 AS to file the petition for the enforcement of the Loan Security (the "Enforcement Proceedings").

The Instructing Bondholders have agreed to cover the costs and expenses incurred by NTM in connection with the Enforcement Proceedings (the 

<<<

"Costs"), provided that NTM does not receive reimbursement from the Issuer following request, and on the basis that (subject to obtaining approval of the reimbursement mechanism by a Bondholders' meeting) NTM shall reimburse to the Instructing

<<<

 Bondholders on a pro rata basis any payments made by them to NTM ahead of any distributions by NTM to Bondholders with respect to the Bonds.

Accordingly, it is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting authorises NTM to reimburse the Instructing

<<<

 Bondholders for any fees, costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with the Enforcement Proceedings out of amounts NTM receives from the Issuer or otherwise in respect of the Bonds. This reimbursement will be made ahead of any payment

<<<

 of principal, interest, premium or otherwise to Bondholders under the Bonds. The effect of this will be that the Costs will be borne by all Bondholders and not just the Instructing Bondholders.

It is also proposed, for the sake of good order

<<<

, that the decision to file the petition for enforcement of the Loan Security is affirmed by a Bondholder meeting.

1.3 Filing for bankruptcy proceedings

As the Bondholders will be aware, the Court of Appeals (Lagmannsretten) in another case

<<<

 involving NTM as loan trustee, ruled that NTM can not file the claim for payment of a guarantee in its own name under the current legislation. The Court of Appeal's decision has been further appealed by NTM to the Supreme Court.

The decision

<<<

 of the Court of Appeals has resulted in NTM's legal capacity to file a petition for bankruptcy in its own name (on behalf of the bondholders) being disputed by the borrower in another case, namely the petition for bankruptcy against Petromena

<<<

 ASA.

2-

N O R SK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
www. (m.stee.no
However, NTM has previously established a foundation (stiftelse) solely set up with the purpose to protect bondholders' rights through processes of restructuring (the "Foundation")

<<<

. In the Petromena case the Foundation acquired, through its wholly owned subsidiary NTM Refectio III AS a minor portion of the issued bonds. NTM Refectio III AS then filed for bankruptcy. The court concluded that NTM Refectio III AS had a cause

<<<

 of action according to the Civil Procedure Act, and this company was also considered a creditor who, according to the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act Section 60 had the right to file for bankruptcy. However, the court emphasized the importance that

<<<

 the petition for bankruptcy was filed in accordance with/by consent from the Bondholders and NTM. The petition to open bankruptcy in Petromena ASA was finally sustained following a bondholders' meeting affirming NTM's decision to file a petition

<<<

 for bankruptcy and consenting to NTM Refectio III AS filing the petition.
In the present case, it may be necessary in order to protect Bondholders' interests, to file a bankruptcy petition against the Borrower. If this becomes necessary, and

<<<

 to minimise the risk of the petition to file for bankruptcy being dismissed by the courts, NTM will set up a new company, named NTM Refectio V AS ("Refectio AS"), wholly owned by the Foundation, which would acquire Bonds and become the petitioning

<<<

 creditor. In the interests of time and expedience, NTM proposes that the same Bondholders' meeting also resolves and approves the filing of a petition for bankruptcy of the Borrower (on the terms set out in this summons) by Refectio AS.
Furthermore

<<<

, since there is judicial precedence that one of the Bondholders have standing to sue and are claimholders in substantive terms in accordance with the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act, NTM propose that the Bondholders' meeting authorises NTM to (i)

<<<

 consent to Refectio AS (and any other Bondholder together with NTM) filing the petition in its own name and on its own behalf as an individual Bondholder, and (ii) enter into agreements with Refectio AS to give effect to this.
Accordingly,

<<<

 NTM proposes that the Bondholders' meeting authorises NTM to file or procure the filing of a bankruptcy petition against the Borrower if instructed to do so by the Instructing Bondholders. The Instructing Bondholders shall have absolute discretion

<<<

 whether to give this instruction and shall have no liability to any Bondholder, or otherwise for giving or failing to give this instruction. NTM may require an indemnity for all cost and liability incurred by NTM related to actions taken according

<<<

 to the instructions before acting upon the instructions.
The Instructing Bondholders may agree to cover the fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities incurred by NTM in connection with such a bankruptcy filing (the "Bankruptcy Costs"). NTM

<<<

 proposes that the Bondholders' meeting also authorises NTM to reimburse the Instructing Bondholders in respect of any Bankruptcy Costs met by them out of any amounts NTM receives from the Issuer or its trustee in bankruptcy, or otherwise in

<<<

 respect of the Bonds. This reimbursement will be made ahead of any payment of principal, interest, premium or otherwise to Bondholders with respect to the Bonds. The effect of this will be that the Bankruptcy Costs will be borne by all Bondholders

<<<

 and not just the Instructing Bondholders.
In the event that it becomes relevant to take possession of the pledged assets, it may be pertinent to set up an SPY to hold and conduct a sale of the assets. Such an SPV will be set up similarly to

<<<

 the above mentioned Refectio AS, and be fully owned by the Foundation. The
-3 -

N O R SK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities' `incurred by such an SPY shall also be considered part of the Costs and/or the Bankruptcy

<<<

 Costs.
INFORMATION ON REFECTIO AS AND ITS OWNER

<<<

<<<

 if they are unqualified or have not fulfilled their duties.

<<<

 capital of NOK 100 000, has no activities or employees, and is established solely for the purpose of protecting the interests of the bondholders who hold bonds issued by the Borrower. This includes taking enforcement action before the courts

<<<

 and other actions which are necessary to fulfil the purpose of protecting the bondholders.
Refectio AS is represented by the Board which consists of Mr. Ragnar Sjoner, managing director of NTM. A change of director may take place in connection

<<<

 with filing of bankruptcy proceedings.
About Stiftelsen Refectio: The objective of the foundation is, pursuant to further agreement with NTM, to acquire or have the disposal over assets in connection with NTM's management of outstanding loans

<<<

, for which there is a risk of default and where NTM ASA is the trustee for the relevant loan, as well as to hold and to realise acquired assets.
The basic capital of the foundation is NOK 200,000. The foundation's paid-in capital may subsequently

<<<

 be increased by contribution from the founder or others.

<<<

 represented by a Board of Directors composed in compliance with the provisions of § 27 of the Foundation Act.

 TILLITSMANN ASA
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at

<<<

 the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account

 number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.)
PLEASE NOTE: Bonds that were drawn and marked for redemption as part of the USD 10 000 000 instalment that was due in May 2009 (the "Drawn Bonds") may not show correctly on the subsequent statements

<<<

. Bondholders may however vote also for the Drawn Bonds. Bondholders affected holding their Bonds through the Norwegian securities register should receive separate voting forms for the Drawn Bonds together with this summons. Bondholders affected
