Stockholm, 23 January 2017

Notice of amendment and restatement of the Terms

<<<

 and Conditions
Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) is the appointed trustee (the "Trustee") under the terms and conditions for the Bonds (the "Terms and Conditions").
This notice is distributed to the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 19

<<<

(c) of the Terms and Conditions.
All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this Notice shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Terms and Conditions and any reference in this Notice to a Clause shall be a reference

<<<

 to such Clause in the Terms and Conditions.

At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee has agreed to amend the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds in accordance with Clause 19(a)(ii) (Amendments and Waivers) of the Terms and Conditions.
The Issuer

<<<

 has in accordance with the Terms and Conditions issued Initial Bonds in the amount of SEK 400,000,000 on 2 December 2016. In connection with the listing of the Initial Bonds an unclarity has been noted in Clause 13.4 (Listing) of the Terms

<<<

 and Conditions as the existing wording of such clause can be interpreted to stipulate a requirement to list all Bonds (i.e. the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) and not only the Initial Bonds within the period of time specified therein

<<<

, which was not the intention. In order to facilitate the listing of the Initial Bonds and any future listing of Subsequent Bonds issued under the Terms and Conditions the Issuer has requested that the unclarity is removed by amending the Terms

<<<

 and Conditions.

Further, in connection with the request referred to above, the Issuer has noted a minor typo in the definition "Extraordinary Distribution" of the Terms and Conditions and the Issuer has therefore requested that the typo is

<<<

 removed by amending the Terms and Conditions.

Since the Issuer and the Trustee have deemed that the proposed amendments are made solely for the purpose of rectifying an obvious error and mistake, the Issuer and the Trustee agree to the amendments

<<<

 set out in the table below.

Existing wording: 13.4 Listing

New wording (added wording underlined and removed wording crossed over): 13.4 Listing

The Issuer shall ensure (i) that the Bonds are listed on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq

 Stockholm within 60 days after the First Issue Date and with an intention to complete such listing within 30 calendar days after the First Issue Date; and (ii) that the Bonds, once admitted to trading on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq Stockholm

<<<

, continue being listed thereon for as long as any Bond is outstanding (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of Nasdaq Stockholm and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection

<<<

 to the redemption of the Bonds).

The Issuer shall ensure (i) that the Bonds are listed on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq Stockholm. The Issuer shall ensure that the Initial Bonds shall be listed within 60 days after the First Issue Date

 being listed thereon for as long as any Bond is outstanding (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of Nasdaq Stockholm and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption
