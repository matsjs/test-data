To the shareholders of Viking Drilling ASA Shareholder letter 03/2008

Oslo, 26 February 2008

Dear Shareholder
The Board of Directors of Viking Drilling

<<<

 ASA has unanimously resolved that the Company and all of its subsidiaries (the "Company") will voluntarily file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that filing for Chapter 11 is necessary

<<<

 to protect the Company's assets, the shareholders as well as the creditors
As informed in our 02/2008 shareholder letter dated 18 February 2008, the reactivation project of SS Viking Producer will result in a major cost overrun. Completing

<<<

 this reactivation project, would require significant additional financing requirement.
The Company has had lenghty discussions with their financial advisors. In the current financial market situation, we have concluded that it will be a major

<<<

 challenge raising additional financing to finance the cost overrun. The Board of Directors believes that the estimated value of the Company's assets, exceeds the sums due to vendors, creditors and bond holders and that the Company has a positive

<<<

 net asset value. Filing for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, will give the Company time and space to find the best alternative for the Company and the stakeholders involved. Based on this, the Board of Directors has decided

<<<

 to, as soon as possible, voluntarily file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the Company and all its subsidiaries in order to evaluate alternative financial and/or strategic opportunities for the Company.
The Company has ordered various

<<<

 types of equipment/iterns. The total cost of this equipment is about $ 120 mill of which about $ 50 mill have been paid and about $ 70 mill remains to be paid. Each of these purchases are governed by a separate purchase order or contract and

<<<

 we are in the midst of a detailed review of each and every of these purchase orders and contracts to determine our status with each vendor and any remedy we might be able to reach in each case. This is a lengthy process and will take some time

<<<

 to complete.
Awaiting the outcome of the evaluation of financial and strategic alternatives under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the Company will consider the utilisation of all existing financial means available to the Company, in order

<<<

 to protect both creditors and equity holders.
Liquidation and winding up of the Company and distribution of proceeds to creditors, bondholders and shareholders under Chapter 11 proceedings may take up to 2 years or longer depending on the number

<<<

 of claims, the complexity of the claims and the sale of the assets of the Company. Chapter 11 proceedings therefore appears to be in the best interest of all stakeholders involved.
The Company has retained legal advisors both in the US and

<<<

 in Norway.

Chapter 11 proceedings are unfortunately expensive however the Board of Directors believes filing for Chapter 11 is the orderly way forward. Yours Sincerely, Viking Drilling ASA
Christen Sveaas Chairman

To the shareholders of Viking Drilling ASA Shareholder letter 02/2008

Oslo, 18 February 2008

Dear Shareholder

As informed in our January 2008 shareholder letter, the management of the Company has been in negotiations with two shipyards

<<<

 regarding a new yard contract and revised outline specification for completing the reactivation project of SS Viking Producer.

As part of the thorough project revision approximately 80% of the necessary engineering requirements have been completed

<<<

. As per today close to $ 150 mill have been invested in the reactivation project of the SS Viking Producer.

Based on the above, the preliminary conclusion is that the completion of the reactivation project will result in an additional cost

<<<

 overrun in excess of $ 125 mill, of which interest charges during the remaining reactivation period is close to $ 40 mill, and a time delay of approximately 6 months. The total reactivation cost is estimated at about $ 300 mill excluding additional

<<<

 financing cost. To complete the reactivation project, the Company has an additional financing requirement of about $ 150 mill including interest charges during the remaining reactivation period.

The Company has had lenghty discussions with

<<<

 their financial advisors. In the current financial market situation, we believe it will be a challenge to raise additional financing in the above mentioned magnitude. Based on this, the Board of Directors has decided to evaluate alternative

<<<

 financial and/or strategic opportunities for the Company. Until a conclusion is reached, the reactivation project will be slowed down. The Company has not drawn on the established $ 125 mill 2ndpriority bond loan. Awaiting the outcome of the

<<<

 evaluation of financial and strategic alternatives, the Company will consider the utilisation of this existing facility.

For the SS Viking Prospector, one of the Company's two other bare deck semi-submersibles rigs, the Company has conditionally

<<<

 agreed on a sale price of $ 40 mill with a non-disclosed buyer. It is too early to say whether this sale will materialise or not. However, the Board of Directors has decided to circulate the Company's two bare deck semi-submersibles rigs, the

<<<

 SS Viking Century and SS Viking Prospector, in the market for sale.

Yours Sincerely, Viking Drilling ASA

 letter 01/2008

Dear shareholder,

1. REACTIVATION PROGRAM - SS VIKING PRODUCER
As highlighted in our December shareholder letter, a new fixed priced / unit rate structured contract with Gulf Copper is under negotiation. At the same time we

<<<

 are negotiating a similar contract with another full service, recognized and reputable shipyard based in the Gulf of Mexico.
We are now in the final stage o f negotiations with these yards and a recommendation will hopefully be presented to

<<<

 the board of directors mid February, and presumably the board will need some time to make a decision. An announcement will be made immediately thereafter.

We expect there to be a further delay in delivery and a significant increase in costs

<<<

 from the budget number given in August 2007, but until we finalize the negotiation with the shipyards final cost to complete is not known. It is likely to assume that the cost increase will have to be financed by equity.

Work continues on

<<<

 board with respect to electrical installation, living quarters refurbishment, installation of the new Seatrax cranes and replacement of wasted steel.
The detailed engineering for the Viking Producer project (i.e. drawings, bill of materials

<<<

, 3D piping diagrams) is largely complete.

2. DRILLING RIG MARKET - FLOATERS (semis and drill ships)

18

The oil companies have been quite active in contracting mid-water floaters in December and January with six term contracts reported, three

<<<

 of which are in our target markets (Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, West Africa and Mediterranean).

The SS GSF Arctic III (1,800 ft, built 1984) has been fixed to Eni for a 1 year charter off Libya at $ 425,000 per day starting September 2008.

The

<<<

 SS Noble Lorris Bouzigard (4,000 ft, built 1975), which is a sister rig of SS Viking Producer, has received a letter of intent from LLOG for a 2 year contract in US Gulf of Mexico at $ 270,000 per day starting April / May 2008.

The SS Ocean

 Ambassador (1,100 ft, built 1975) has been extended to Pemex, Mexico until

i

April 2008 at $ 190,000 in direct continuation of its current charter contract with Pemex.

UIKIIIC DRILLIIIC HSR

The total number of mid-water floaters 

<<<

(up to 3,000 ft) currently working in our target markets is counting 34 units, five of which are scheduled to become available before end 2008 including SS Viking Producer. Three o f these units are in the Gulf of Mexico and one unit in each

<<<

 of West Africa and Mediterranean. One of the units in Gulf of Mexico is rated for 1,100 ft water depth and the unit in West Africa has an option beyond end 2008.
The total number of floaters rated for water between 3,000 - 5,000 ft currently

<<<

 working in our target markets is counting 28 units, five of which are scheduled to become available before end 2008. Three of these units have options beyond end 2008.
The mid-water floaters segment in the other regions is showing high activity

<<<

 as well. The SS G rand Banks (1,500 ft, built 1984) has been fixed to Husky Oil for a 3 year contract in Canada at $ 353,000 per day starting January 2008. The SS Ocean General (2,400 ft, built 1976) has received a letter of intent from PVEP

<<<
