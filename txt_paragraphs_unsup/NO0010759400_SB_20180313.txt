Reference is made to our letter dated 20 February 2018 and our meeting in your offices

<<<

 on 22 February 2018.
The Issuer has reviewed the various options for the Hilleren project along the lines discussed in our meeting.
Development of the project The Issuer strongly believe that the best solution for all parties is to move forward

<<<

 with the project, utilizing the approvals to start developing 24.000 sq.m.
The Issuer has entered into an agreement with DF Forvaltning AS, a real estate company in Bergen, to take care o f rentals and real estate administration. Their experienced

<<<

 staff is knowledgeable and very well connected in the real estate market in the Bergen area.
Rentals The plan is to develop the property as a local community centre, with common services for community centres, and with a particular focus on

<<<

 health. The ground floor will contain a supermarket and a pharmacy. A sports centre, dentists and other health related activities and offices are planned for the higher floors.
Subject to the realization of this project, the largest group of

<<<

 physicians in the Bergen West area plans to build a medical centre on a neighbouring plot, aiming to create a mutually positive effect for the health-related activities in the building. The plot is owned by the Issuer, and we ask the Bondholders

<<<

 to release the security over this plot. The proceeds will be used to redeem bonds.

The plan is to enter into tenancy contracts for the higher floors in the expected nine months construction period for the foundation/basement, and that the

<<<

 construction can run in a continuous process.
Subject to agreement with the Bondholders, we aim to speed up the building process and shorten the time to profit, by deviating from the previous plan of a project in co-operation with Bergen municipality

<<<

 for healthcare and support for seniors. The reason is that this will require formal changes to the building approvals. The process o f formal approval appears to take more time than we believe we have at hand.
Construction Construction is planned

<<<

 in phases, with phase 1 involving the foundation/basement and the ground floor (for shopping). Assuming that an agreement can be reached with the Bondholders and that construction financing is secured, construction is planned to start this

<<<

 summer. The phased construction provides flexibility in the construction phase, and we believe it is important to commence construction in order initiate the project and thereby initiate interest from further tenants. With a nine months construction

<<<

 period for the foundation/basement, we expect the foundation/basement and ground floor to be completed by 2Q 2019, and that phase two with the remaining floors will be built in a continuous process.
The nine months construction period also

<<<

 provides time for securing tenants for the higher floors before the building o f these floors commences. In the event that tenancy contracts have not been entered into at the end of phase 1, the construction flexibility mentioned above, also

<<<

 offers the alternative o f building the higher floors when tenancy contracts for these floors have been agreed. If so, this phase will be divided into sub-phases. The top floor will be built with a garden separating two building bodies, offering

<<<

 a pleasant environment.
The foundation/basement will be built by Sartor Maskin AS, while Lars Jønsson AS and Bergen Prosjekt og Sofi a Entreprenør AS will be the companies responsible for construction of the building. They are all experienced

<<<

 and well reputed companies, with whom we have co operated on previous projects.
Forward sale of sections In order to reduce the risk and subject to agreement with the Bondholders and secured construction financing, the Issuer plan to sell the

<<<

 sections forward in parallel to entering into tenancy contracts. Subject to satisfactory pricing, this will secure the profit before the start of construction. Preliminary discussion with possible construction financiers have indicated that

<<<

 this will also be a requirement for the construction financing.
Financial implications and topics for the Bondholders to decide The Issuer's prime goal is to secure repayment of the Bondholders' investment. However, the same investment and

<<<

 its security is now blocking further development of the project, as no construction financing will be available with the Bonds in place. We expect construction financing to be available only subject to first priority mortgage of the property

<<<

, and no servicing o f the Bonds.
In order to complete the planning and enabling the construction financing, inter alia accounting and audit, the Issuer ask for a release o f the 1 MNOK of the 2 MNOK liquidity
2

buffer, and that room for additional

<<<

 financing o f up to 3 MNOK on first priority is provided by the Bondholders. We further ask that interest and costs on the Bonds are frozen from original Maturity, which then becomes the basis for the later conversion o f Bonds to shares. As

<<<

 important information required for the decisions to be made, is not available at this time, we also ask that a proposal for the terms o f the refinancing is to be put forward only after the terms and conditions o f the construction financing

<<<

 are known.
Time schedule A bondholders' meeting must be summoned, with a bondholders' meeting to be held before Easter 2018, to approve the proposals above. Subject to availability o f 5 MNOK for the Issuer, the Issuer completes the planning

<<<

 and invites offers for the total project cost in April-May 2018. The terms and conditions for the construction financing to be available no later than 20 June 2018. A proposal for the refinancing o f the Issuer to be prepared no later than

<<<

 25 June 2018, for the Bondholders' meeting to decide. In order to avoid unneeded delays, such decision to be made in a Bondholders' meeting no later than 30 June 2018, and notwithstanding the participation of the Bondholders' meeting, in accordance

<<<

 with the Bond Agreement clause 16.4.2. We ask that the Bondholders nominate a representative to follow the progress of the process mentioned above. Consequence for Bondholders The Issuer is aware that the shares o f the Issuer are pledged and

<<<

 that the property is mortgaged in favour o f the Bondholders, and that the Bondholder may choose to take over the project at this time. The Issuer believe this will be the least profitable alternative for all parties. We believe that working

<<<

 with the Issuer to complete the project will be give the best result for everybody and asks for such co-operation. We look forward to your view on the proposals above and expect to hear from you shortly. Yours faithfully, Hilleren Tomteselskap
