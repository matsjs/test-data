 THINKING AT THE CRITICAL TIMETM

Joint Administrators' Report and Statement of Proposals
1. Introduction
1.1 Chad Griffin and Lisa Rickelton ("the Administrators") were appointed as Joint Administrators of the Companies on 6 January 2016.

<<<

 We are required to send creditors a report setting out what has happened since our appointment and how we intend to progress, and achieve the purpose of, the Administrations of the Companies.
1.2 Details of the statutory information relating

<<<

 to our appointments are set out in Appendix A. 1.3 This report together with appendices also contains information in relation to the activities undertaken since our appointment,
receipts and payments into the insolvency estates (Appendix B

<<<

), the necessary disclosures concerning a `pre-packaged sale' in accordance with Statement of Insolvency Practice 16 ("SIP16") for the Trent and Tyne ("T&T") and West Wick transactions (Appendix G and Appendix H), and the Administrators' time

<<<

 costs in accordance with Statement of Insolvency Practice 9 ("SIP9") (Appendix C, D and E) since the date of the Administrators appointment. 1.4 The estimated return to creditors is set out in Section 2 of this report.
Purpose of the Administrations

<<<


1.5 The purpose of an administration must be to achieve one of the following statutory objectives (in order): a. Rescuing the company as a going concern; b. Achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely

<<<

 if the company were wound up (without first being in administration); or c. Realising property in order to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors.
1.6 At this stage, given the continuing discussions in relation

<<<

 to a potential CVA the purpose of the Administration of PLC is objective a. However, this would change to b if a CVA is not pursued or cannot be achieved.
1.7 The purpose of the Huntington Administration is objective c as the focus is on asset

<<<

 realisation.
Administrators' remuneration
1.8 In accordance with Rule 2.106 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (as amended) ("the Rules") (applicable to Huntington) and Rules 2.39 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1986 ("the Scottish Rules") (applicable

<<<

 to PLC) we propose that we will be remunerated on the basis of time costs incurred by the Administrators and their staff properly spent in carrying out the respective Administrations. Details of the rules in relation to Administrators' remuneration

<<<

 together with details of the Administrators' time costs to date are set out in Appendix C and D.
1.9 Our fees and disbursements are subject to creditor approval. A creditors' guide to administrators' fees setting out creditors' rights to further

<<<

 information and how fees are approved can be found here: England and Wales (applicable to Huntington) https://www.r3.org.uk/media/documents/publications/professional/Guide_to_Administrators_Fees_Oct_2015.pdf Scotland (applicable to PLC) https

<<<

1.10 If creditors wish to be supplied with a hard copy of this guidance they should contact the Administrators using the details

<<<

 set out at the end of this report.
1.11 Additional information in relation to the Administrators' staffing policies can be found in Appendix E.
Meetings of creditors and further information
1.12 We do not intend to convene meetings of creditors

<<<

 in the Administration of either PLC or Huntington as, in accordance with Paragraph 52(1)(b) of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) ("the Act"), we consider that the only returns to unsecured creditors (if any) of the Companies

<<<

 will be from the Prescribed Part. If objective a is pursued and the intention is to begin the CVA process in relation to PLC, a meeting of creditors will be summoned to approve the terms of the CVA. As such, meetings in the Administrations

<<<

 are not required unless requested by creditors totaling 10% of the total claims against the respective company, pursuant to Paragraph 52(2)(a) of Schedule B1 of the Act.

CRITICAL THINKING AT THE CRITICAL TIMETM

Joint Administrators' Report and Statement of Proposals
3.7 On 18 November 2105, following the failure of a restructuring process, Iona Energy Inc announced

<<<

 that the Companies would likely need to be placed into an insolvency process to protect the interests of the stakeholders of the Companies.
3.8 Since 18 November 2015, and following consultation with the bondholder committee, the Bond Trustee

<<<

 and FTI, management of the Companies have run an AM&A process for the shares in and / or all of the assets of the Companies.
3.9 In parallel to this, contingency planning was undertaken for the potential Administration of the Companies. Ultimately

<<<

, with regard to the progress of the AM&A process and other considerations, the decision was taken to place the Companies into administration.
4. Conduct of the Administrations
Administration purpose/strategy
4.1 The purpose of the Administration

<<<

 of PLC is envisaged to be statutory objective a. This depends upon the outcome of ongoing discussions in relation to a potential Orlando / Kells transaction and achieving a Creditors Voluntary Arrangement ("CVA").
4.2 The purpose of the Huntington

<<<

 Administration will be objective c given that the focus has been on the realisation of assets only for the benefit of creditors.
AM&A process
4.3 As stated above and as discussed at Appendix G, since 18 November 2015 management of the Companies

<<<

 ran an AM&A process which has been continued during the administration. A summary of the process is provided below.
4.4 Prospective purchasers were asked to bid on the any / all of the following:
 the shares in or assets of Huntington;
 asset

<<<

 sales of PLC's license interests, principally Orlando, Kells, Trent & Tyne, West Wick, and Ronan and Oran licenses; and
 the shares in PLC. 4.5 Management prepared a summary of the Companies' business and assets which was distributed to prospective

<<<

 purchasers
on 23 November 2015 who were given an initial target date of 4 December 2015 for the submission of their bids, later extended for certain assets. 4.6 Details of the interest received and the status of each asset covered under the

<<<

 AM&A process is provided below. Shares in PLC / Orlando and Kells license asset sale 4.7 Interest has been received in connection with a possible sale of a restructured PLC's holding in the Orlando and Kells licenses. Discussions in this regard

<<<

 are ongoing and remain commercially sensitive. The mechanism for restructuring PLC would be a CVA, the details of this are still under discussion with interested parties. 4.8 Bids have also been received for an asset sale of the Orlando and

<<<

 Kells licenses. At this stage our current focus is on a share sale and CVA route given this would result in a better return for creditors. 4.9 Due to the status of the Orlando project, we continue to make every effort to keep key suppliers

<<<

, as well as DECC / OGA, fully appraised of the process and status. 4.10 Should a sale of PLC proceed, we would write to all creditors of PLC and provide our CVA proposal for consideration. Trent and Tyne license transaction 4.11 PLC's interest

<<<

 in T&T was deemed to have no or negative value to PLC. Accordingly, the strategy was to divest the license to, and agree a consensual settlement of all outstanding claims and counter claims with, PLC's T&T joint operating partner, Perenco UK

<<<

 Limited ("Perenco"). The consideration for this transaction comprised such consensual settlement and nil cash consideration. 4.12 We supported this transaction given there was no realistic prospect of an alternative sale for greater value,

<<<

 together with PLC's release from a number of actual and potential liabilities in respect of the license. 4.13 Further details of the Trent and Tyne transaction are covered in relevant SIP16 disclosure at Appendix G.

CRITICAL THINKING AT THE CRITICAL TIMETM

Joint Administrators' Report and Statement of Proposals
West Wick license transaction 4.14 On 3 February 2016 we signed a sale of PLC's interest in the West Wick license for $1.8m to Chevron North

<<<

 Sea Limited.
(`Chevron'). Transaction proceeds are deferred and contingent, linked to the approval of a field development plan. 4.15 Whilst the sale was executed some 4 weeks following our appointment as Administrators, we consider the transaction

<<<

 to
meet the criteria of a "pre-packaged sale" given the sale was subject to pre-appointment negotiation with Chevron and their due diligence continued during our appointment as Administrators. 4.16 Accordingly we provide the necessary disclosures

<<<

 for this transaction in accordance with SIP16 at Appendix H. The transaction has not yet completed, pending certain consents, assignments and security releases. Transactions relating to other licenses held by PLC 4.17 PLC also held a working

<<<

 interest in three other exploration licenses; Ronan & Oran, Fleetwind and Farne & Lundy. These licenses generated no interest during the AM&A process. Ronan & Oran and Fleetwind licenses have now been relinquished. PLC has also notified withdrawal

<<<

 from the Farne & Lundy license. Huntington licenses and other entitlements 4.18 In addition to the 15% interest in the Huntington field, Huntington also owns the following entitlements: 1.2% royalty entitlement from Premier Oil UK Limited 

<<<

("Premier"); 0.6% royalty entitlement from Noreco Denmark A/S ("Noreco"); and 0.75% disproportionate lifting entitlement ("DLE") with Eon. 4.19 The above assets were offered to prospective purchases as part of the AM&A process. These assets

<<<

 generated reasonable interest and several offers were submitted which we assessed for both value and deliverability. 4.20 The preferred bidder for the Premier royalty stream was Premier which we believed presented the highest and most credible

<<<

 bid. The ultimate transaction agreed represented a full and final settlement of outstanding royalty arrears and the termination of future royalty payments due to PLC. 4.21 On 25 January 2016 we agreed a termination with Premier for $900k due

<<<

 to the continued decline in oil prices since the initial offer was made. We still considered that this transaction was the best reasonably attainable. 4.22 Despite having marketed the asset for sale prior to our appointment as part of the AM

<<<

&A process, the transaction was a termination of a contract. Accordingly the Administrators do not believe the Huntington termination agreement met the criteria to warrant an additional SIP 16 disclosure. 4.23 Efforts to realise the value in

<<<

 the remaining Huntington entitlements continue. 4.24 No interest was received in relation to Huntington's 15% license interest. A default was persisting at the commencement of the administration. On 29 January 2016 we received notice from the

<<<

 joint operating partners stating that, pursuant to the default, they were exercising their rights to acquire Huntington's interest.
Receipts and payments during the period - PLC
4.25 A receipts and payments account for PLC covering the period

<<<

 of this report is provided at Appendix B. 4.26 Details of the material receipts and payments during the period are summarised below.
Cash on appointment
4.27 Cash on appointment totaled 1.5m.
Prepayments recoveries
4.28 To date, the Administrators

<<<

 have realised 37k from cash held on account in respect of corporate credit card facilities that have been cancelled on our appointment. A further repayment of cash held on account of 4k has been recovered from pre appointment legal advisors

<<<

.
Joint venture income
4.29 During the administration, the Administrators have raised invoices to PLC's joint venture partners for their share of pre appointment cash expenditure on the corresponding licenses. To date the Administrators have

 recovered 11k from Atlantic

Petroleum North Sea Limited ("Atlantic") in respect of the Kells license and 6k from Idemitsu

Moveable assets and PPE
4.31 The Administrators continue to liaise with auctioneers

<<<

 and other interested parties in respect of PLC's moveable assets and PPE.
Employees and project critical contractors
4.32 All employees and project critical contractors have been retained during the initial stage of the administrations to support

<<<

 the AM&A process. On 31 January 2016, 2 employees who were no longer deemed necessary to the delivery of the AM&A process and the realisation of the Companies' license interests were made redundant.
4.33 To date employee and contractors' related

<<<

 costs total 169k. The Administrators continually appraise the staffing levels.
Legal fees and critical suppliers
4.34 Certain legal fees were paid as part of the T&T transaction amounting to c.60k. 4.35 We would also note that there are outstanding

<<<

 legal fees of 260k in respect of pre-appointment legal fees payable to the
Secured Creditors' legal advisors. We expect these will be paid in due course from the Administration estate. 4.36 Payments to critical suppliers have totaled 23k

<<<

 to date, principally comprising certain demurrage costs in respect of the pre
appointment liquids liftings. Payment of the demurrage costs was necessary to ensure our entitlement to sell the associated liquids lifted.
Receipts and payments

<<<

 during the period - Huntington
4.37 A receipts and payments account for the Huntington during the period covered by this report is provided at Appendix B. 4.38 Details of the material receipts (other than royalty termination as discussed above

<<<

) and payments during the period are
summarised below.
Cash on appointment
4.39 Cash on appointment totaled 4.4m.
Book debts
4.40 Book debts relate to gas and oil sales from the Huntington field together with the royalty entitlements and the

<<<

 DLE. The book value of book debts totaled c.1.9m. To date 515k of book debts have been recovered in the administration.
4.41 The Administrators continue to pursue trade debtors for amounts which they believe are due to Huntington in respect

<<<

 of further gas and oil sales, royalty entitlements and the DLE.
Statutory investigations
4.42 We have undertaken initial investigation work in accordance with SIP2 including a review of the books and records of the Companies in order to understand

<<<

 the realisable assets of the Companies and comparing these to the values in the directors' statement of affairs. We continue to investigate the affairs of the Companies to assess whether any potential recovery actions can be undertaken. These

<<<

 investigations are subject to confidentiality.
4.43 In addition, the data gathered from our initial investigations will assist with our statutory duties pursuant to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. We are obliged to review the

<<<

 conduct of all directors who served in respect of the Companies in the 3 year period prior to the date of Administrations.
4.44 Should any creditors have any further relevant information in relation to directors' conduct, they should provide

<<<

 details in writing to the Administrators. This request forms part of our normal investigations into directors' conduct and does not imply any criticism of the directors in this particular case. The content of our reports in relation to this

<<<

 are confidential and must be submitted to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

Joint Administrators' Report and Statement of Proposals
Taxation
4.45 We have notified

<<<

 HM Revenue and Customs of our appointment and in due course appropriate filings will be made to support the Companies' corporation tax and VAT positions at the date of the administrations. Based on information currently available, we believe

<<<

 PLC should be entitled to a VAT recovery. However, the quantum and timing of any such receipt remains unclear.
5. Directors' statement of affairs
5.1 Attached at Appendix F is a copy of the directors' statement of affairs for the Companies

<<<

 as at the date of the appointment of the Administrators, together with a list of creditors at the time of appointment, whose details have been provided by the directors. Please note that the format of the Statement of Affairs does not include

<<<

 any provision for the costs of the Administrations. An estimate of the return to creditors based on the information provided by the directors, and from our work to date, is included in the next section of the report.
5.2 Our commentary on the

<<<

 Statement of Affairs for certain entities is included at Appendix F.
6. Estimated outcomes
6.1 The estimated outcomes detailed below exclude the impact of any sale of PLC (post CVA) since this is not yet formulated and is uncertain.
Secured

<<<

 creditors
6.2 At the date of the appointments the Secured Creditors were owed $263m by the Companies. The Secured Creditors hold a number of securities dated 30 September 2013 which are summarised in the T&T SIP16 letter enclosed at Appendix

<<<

 G.
6.3 The above balance is net of a restricted cash balance of $57m which the Secured Creditors enforced over on 22 December 2015.
6.4 Excluding any recoveries from Orlando / Kells, we estimate that the Secured Creditors will recover between

<<<

 nil - $1.9m from the Administration of PLC. In relation to the Administration of Huntington, we estimate a range of $2.6m - $7.0m.
Preferential creditors
6.5 We do not anticipate any preferential creditors in either PLC or Huntington.
Unsecured

<<<

 creditors
6.6 Unsecured creditors rank behind both secured and preferential creditors. 6.7 Under Section 176A of the Act where after 15 September 2003 the company has granted a creditor a floating charge, a
proportion of the net property of

<<<

 the company achieved from floating charge asset realisations must be made available for the unsecured creditors ("the Prescribed Part"). 6.8 There are unlikely to be sufficient funds to repay the Secured Creditors in full, therefore returns

<<<

 to unsecured creditors will come from the Prescribed Part only (excluding any possible PLC CVA distribution). 6.9 The Prescribed Part applies where there are net floating charge realisations (i.e. after costs of realisation) available to unsecured

<<<

 creditors and is calculated as follows:  50% of net property up to 10k.  Plus 20% of net property in excess of 10k.  Subject to a maximum of 600k. 6.10 The level of any Prescribed Part distribution is subject to significant uncertainty

<<<

 and therefore estimates of the Prescribed Part may be subject to change. 6.11 We currently expect the Prescribed Part in Huntington may reach the maximum of 600k. 6.12 In terms of PLC, we estimate there may be insufficient net realisations

<<<

 and no funds available to pay a Prescribed Part to the unsecured creditors. In the event there are sufficient net realisations, any Prescribed Part is likely to be small.

 declare and pay a Prescribed Part distribution to unsecured creditors without the need for Court approval.
6.14 The requirement to make the Prescribed Part distribution to unsecured creditors is disapplied if, inter alia, the administrator

Proposed Strategy, Actions and Activities

7.3 The Administrators will continue to manage the affairs of the Companies in order to achieve the purpose of the Administration.
7.4 To do all such other things and generally exercise all of our powers as contained in Schedule B1 of the Act

, as the Administrators consider desirable or expedient to achieve the statutory purpose of the Administration.
7.5 To consider whether a CVA proposal should be issued in respect of PLC and if so formulate a CVA for PLC's creditors. 7.6 To investigate

<<<

 and as appropriate pursue any claims the Companies may have. 7.7 We shall be authorised to agree the claims of the secured and unsecured creditors against each of the Companies unless we
conclude, in our reasonable opinion, that the respective

<<<

 company in administration will have no assets available for distribution. 7.8 We shall be authorised to distribute funds to the secured and preferential creditors (if applicable) as and when claims are agreed and funds permit. 7.9 In relation

<<<

 to potential distributions to unsecured creditors by virtue of a Prescribed Part, we are authorised to do so in accordance with S128(2) of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 ("SBEEA") and its amendment to Paragraph 65(3

Creditors Committee
7.10 In the event the creditors of any of the Companies so determine a creditors' committee be appointed in respect of that company, the committee shall comprise no more than five and not less

 than three creditors of that company.
Proposed Exit Routes
7.11 In accordance with Rule 2.33(2)m of the Rules (in relation to Huntington) and Rule 2.25 of the Scottish Rules (in relation to PLC) set out below are the proposed exit strategies

<<<

 for the Companies. PLC
7.12 The most likely deemed exit route for PLC is dependent on the ongoing discussions with prospective purchasers of the Orlando and Kells licenses.
7.13 Should a CVA be achieved, the likely exit strategy route would

In addition, the Administrators have incurred Category 1 

<<<

(out of pocket) expenses of 946.70 and no Category 2 expenses during the period. None of these expenses have been drawn during the period.
Category 1 expenses are not subject to creditor approval. Category 2 disbursements do require approval

Administrators' fee estimate

We estimate that our time costs for the duration of the

<<<

 appointments will not exceed 665,048 for PLC and 238,098 for Huntington. A breakdown of our fee estimate for each of the Companies' is provided below. We note that this i) includes time estimated to be incurred on preparatory work for the

<<<

 possible sale of PLC shares delivered through a CVA and as such, could be lower should the CVA not be achieved; and ii) excludes our undrawn pre appointment time costs as detailed above.
Administrators' fee estimate represents the likely time

<<<

 costs that will be incurred in undertaking their duties in respect to the Companies during the Administration and, should the administrator become the liquidator, their duties in the liquidation. It is important to note that the quantum of

<<<

 remuneration drawn will be limited by the realisations from the Companies' assets and as such fees will only be drawn if there are funds in the Administration, or subsequent liquidation, to do so.
The Administrators' fee estimate does not relate

 to the fees which may be incurred by the office holder should PLC be placed into a CVA.

CRITICAL THINKING AT THE CRITICAL TIMETM

Joint Administrators' Report and Statement of Proposals

Appendix E - Additional Information in relation to Administrators' fees pursuant to SIP9
Detailed below

<<<

 is FTI's policy in relation to:  staff allocation and the use of sub-contractors;  professional advisors; and  disbursements.
Staff allocation and the use of subcontractors
Our approach to resourcing our assignments is to allocate staff

<<<

 with the skills and experience to meet the specific requirements of the case. The constitution of the case team will draw from a Senior Managing Director, Managing Director, Director, Senior Consultant and Consultant. The exact constitution

<<<

 of the case team will depend on the anticipated size and complexity of the assignment. With regard to support staff, we would advise that time spent by cashiers in relation to specific tasks on an assignment is charged. Only if there is a large

<<<

 block of time incurred by a member of the secretarial team, eg, report compilation and distribution, do we seek to charge and recover our time in this regard.
Professional advisors
On this assignment we have used the professional advisors listed

<<<

 below. We have also indicated alongside, the basis of our fee arrangement with them, which is subject to review on a regular basis.

Name of professional advisor
CMS Cameron McKenna LLP (legal advice)
Akin Gump LLP HBJ Gateley

Basis of fee arrangement

Fees paid to date ()

<<<

7.40
nil 800.00

Our choice was based on our view of their experience and ability to perform this type of work, the complexity and nature of the assignment and the basis of our fee arrangement with them.
We have utilised the services of other

<<<

 teams within FTI Consulting LLP to assist with the Administration processes. The fees of our tax, technology and strategic communications teams have been included in our SIP9 analysis provided to creditors of the Companies and allocated to

<<<

 the work streams and entities to which their work related, for approval by those parties approving our fees.
We consider that the rates chargeable for these services are in line with general market practice and that the service is comparable

<<<

 to similar firms of professional advisors. In addition, by working closely with our internal teams, we believe a more coordinated and cost-effective approach to the Administration work streams has been possible.
Disbursements
Category 1 disbursements

<<<

 do not require approval by creditors. The type of disbursements that may be charged as a Category 1 disbursement to a case generally comprise of external supplies of incidental services specifically identifiable to the case, such as postage

<<<

, case advertising, invoiced travel and external printing, room hire and document storage. Also chargeable will be any properly reimbursed expenses incurred by personnel in connection with the case.
Category 2 disbursements do require approval

<<<

 from creditors. These disbursements can include costs incurred which relate to payments due to associated companies for the provision of services to the office holder.

CRITICAL THINKING AT THE CRITICAL TIMETM

Joint Administrators' Report and Statement

<<<

 of Proposals
Appendix F - Directors' statement of affairs
The Directors' Statement of Affairs signed by the directors of the Companies are shown below. The Statement of Affairs reflects the directors understanding of the affairs of the Companies

<<<

 at the point at which the Companies entered Administration. The Administrators have reviewed the Statement of Affairs of the Companies and have the following key comments below:
Iona Energy Company (UK) PLC
1.1 Debtors as at the date of appointment

<<<

 had a book value of $11.3m, of which the directors have estimated purchase VAT of $2.8m and $8k of accrued income from Idemitsu can be recovered. The balance mostly relates to potential JV billings on the Orlando project. Post Administration

<<<

, JV recoveries have been limited but we continue to pursue certain items.
1.2 Loans and advances with a book value of $224k primarily relates to the rental deposit which is deemed to be irrecoverable. 1.3 The directors have not attributed any

<<<

 value to the Orlando or West Wick licenses. Our estimated returns to creditors referred
to in this report also excludes recovery from these assets.
Iona UK Huntington Limited
1.4 The directors have estimated $768k to be realised from trade

<<<

 debtors, comprising: $556k in respect of the Premier Royalty; $31k in respect of their prorate entitlement to the HT-57 lifting; $151k from pre appointment sales of Butane; and $29k of recoverable purchase VAT.
1.5 We consider this to be a

<<<

 realistic estimate of the realisable value of the company's trade debtors. 1.6 Realisations in respect of the Huntington's Royalty entitlement from Premier are estimated at $334k. This is reflective of the
$900k offer for the royalty termination

<<<

 and settlement of trade debtors. 1.7 The directors have not attributed realisable value to Huntington's other entitlements (Noreco or DLE) nor the pre appointment
gas sales.

Dear Sir/Madam

Ref: CG/LR/AH/CP
When telephoning please ask for Will Marsden: Direct Line: 0203 727 1342
Direct Email: William.Marsden@fticonsulting.com

Iona Energy Company (UK) Plc ( "Iona UK") Iona UK Huntington Limited ( "Iona Huntington

<<<

") - both in administration (together, the "Companies")

I advise that Chad Griffin and I were appointed join t administrators of the Companies (the "Joint Administrators" or "we") on 6 January 2016. Please find attached formal notice of the

<<<

 appointments.

Purpose of this Letter

A term "pre-packaged sale" refers to an arrangement under which the sale of all or part of a company's business or assets is negotiated with a purchaser prior to the appointment of an administrator and

<<<

 the administrator effects the sale immediately on, or shortly after, appointment.

The purpose of this letter is to inform creditors of Iona UK, in accordance with Statement of Insolvency Practice 16 ( "SIP16"), of the background in relation

<<<

 to a pre-packaged sale of one of the assets of Iona UK to demonstrate to creditors that such pre-packaged sales have been undertaken with due regard to their interests. This letter also provides a broader update to creditors of the Companies

<<<

 and information in relation to potential further transactions, certain of which may be subject to further SIP16 disclosures.

Background to the Administrations

The Companies hold licences to extract oil and gas from the UK sector of the North

<<<

 Sea. Iona Huntington is a wholly owned subsidiary of Iona UK. The immediate and ultimate parent company of Iona UK is Iona Energy Inc. (the "Parent", and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group"), a Canadian entity which has recently delisted

<<<

. A group structure chart is appended at Appendix I. The licences held by the Companies are set out in Appendix II.

The consolidated financial performance of the Companies for the last two reported financial years is summarised below. The profitability

<<<

 of the business has been impacted by operational problems at the Huntington field, a delay in the projected first oil date for the Orlando oil field ( "Orlando") and a global reduction in oil and gas prices.

In September 2013, Iona UK issued US$275m of senior secured bonds (the "Bonds

<<<

") to the holders of the Bonds (the "Bondholders") pursuant to a bond agreement (the "Bond Agreement"). On 18 December 2014, the Parent issued a press release advising that it was likely that financial covenants contained within the Bond Agreement

<<<

 would be breached during the following 12 months, as a result of the challenges described above.
During early 2015, discussions commenced with the largest Bondholders and an ad-hoc committee of Bondholders was formed (the "Bondholder Committee

<<<

"). FTI Consulting LLP ( "FTI") was retained as financial advisor to the Bondholder Committee, which engagement was subsequently novated to Nordic Trustee ASA as bond trustee ( "Nordic Trustee" or the "Bond Trustee").
On 27 March 2015, Iona

<<<

 UK obtained approval of the Bondholders to covenant relief and a deferral of the payment of cash interest on the Bonds until first oil on Orlando, along with certain other amendments to the terms of the Bond Agreement, in exchange for which

<<<

 the Group agreed to provide an acceptable proposal in order to refinance the Bonds and/or obtain funding in order to enable first oil on Orlando to be reached (a "Restructuring Proposal").
During the subsequent months, the Group worked to develop

<<<

 a Restructuring Proposal, which was based on the development of Orlando. This work involved an extensive search for potential debt and/or equity investors in Orlando or the business as a whole, as well as the disposal of non-core assets. This

<<<

 led to a presentation to Bondholders of a Restructuring Proposal on 30 July 2015.
On 6 August 2015, the Bondholders approved the Restructuring Proposal presented to them on 30 July 2015. The key elements of the Restructuring Proposal were:

<<<


 a farm out of 25% from Iona UK's 75% interest in Orlando (the "Orlando Farm Out");  a partner fully funding technical studies on the Ronan & Oran discovery;  reaching agreements with counterparties to defer payments or provide loans for

<<<

 pat of the required
capital expenditure on Orlando;  capital expenditure savings on Orlando;  a partial debt for equity swap in respect of the Bonds to reduce the level of debt; and  certain amendments to the terms of the Bond Agreement

<<<

.
On 3 August 2015, P/F Atlantic Petroleum ( "Atlantic"), Iona UK's join t venture partner in Orlando, issued a statement indicating that it did not have sufficient funding in place to fully meet its 25% share of development costs for Orlando

<<<

 and that it was engaged in efforts to secure a solution. As a result, Management undertook additional efforts to obtain funding for Atlantic's share of Orlando development costs as a precautionary measure in the event that Atlantic was unable

<<<

 to raise sufficient funding.
On 18 November 2015, the Parent announced that the Restructuring Proposal would not proceed. This was because the parent company of the Orlando Farm Out counterparty, a global energy company, had elected to restrict

<<<

 capital allocation to its upstream operations and therefore a key component of the Restructuring Proposal could not be completed. The Parent's announcement stated that it was likely that the Companies would need to be placed into an insolvency

<<<

 process to protect the interests of all stakeholders to the Companies. In light of this development, on the basis that it was not expected there would be any recovery for the Parent's shareholders, the Parent's shares were ultimately suspended

<<<

 from trading on the TSX Venture Exchange.
Since 18 November 2015, and following consultation with the Bondholder Committee, the Bond Trustee and FTI, management of the Companies ( "Management") have run an accelerated M&A process (the "Accelerated

<<<

 M&A Process") for the shares in and/or some or all of the assets of the Companies. In parallel, we undertook contingency planning for the potential administration of the Companies, which included liaising with certain key stakeholders such

<<<

 as the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( "DECC") and the Oil and Gas Authority (the "OGA").
2

Accelerated M&A Process
We set out below an overview of the Accelerated M&A Process. Further details in relation to this process can be

<<<

 found in Appendix III.
The time available for the Accelerated M&A Process was limited by:
 the tim ing of key project milestones and capex payments in respect of Orlando in order to meet the target first oil date of Q4 2016;
 the requirement

<<<

 to make material cash commitments towards future decommissioning liabilities on the Huntington and Trent & Tyne fields; and
 the continuing weakness in the oil price.
These factors, combined with the market intelligence gained by Management

<<<

 during the development of the Restructuring Proposal, led to the decision to undertake a further targeted marketing effort in order to seek to maximise potential value for creditors.
We determined that Management were best placed to lead the

<<<

 Accelerated M&A Process given the accelerated timetable, their prior engagement with many potential interested parties throughout 2015 in connection with the development of the Restructuring Proposal, and their knowledge of the assets. We were

<<<

 kept appraised of the various steps taken and the progress made during the Accelerated M&A Process and we were involved in all key decisions.
Management prepared a short summary of the Companies' business and assets (the "Summary"), which was

<<<

 sent to 42 parties considered most likely to have a strategic interest in acquiring the shares of the Companies or some or all of the Companies' assets. A number of prospective purchasers who had seen the announcement made by the Parent on

<<<

 18 November 2015, and/or who had received press coverage online and in print, also indicated their interest. The Summary was distributed to prospective purchasers on 23 November 2015, who were given an initial target date of 4 December 201

<<<

5 to send in their bids.
13 prospective purchasers signed non-disclosure agreements and were given access to a data room, which contained corporate, financial and operating information relating to the Companies and their assets, as well as draft

<<<

 transaction documentation, upon the signing of a confidentiality agreement. Management also held an intensive series of calls and meetings with prospective purchasers in order to progress potential transactions.
Prospective purchasers were

<<<

 asked to bid for any or all of the following:
 the shares in Iona Huntington, including tax pool losses;  asset sales of the Orlando, Kells, Trent & Tyne, and Ronan and Oran licences;  asset sales of the remaining exploration licences and

<<<

 the West Wick discovery; and  the shares in Iona UK, including tax pool losses.
A separate marketing exercise was undertaken for certain assets of the Companies including:
 royalty rights and a differential lifting entitlement ( "DLE") relating

<<<

 to, but separate from, the Huntington licence interest; and
 certain plant and equipment.
The Joint Administrators have reviewed the offers received, the conditions attached to them, and discussed with Management the information presented

<<<

 to the prospective purchasers. The Joint Administrators have also attended meetings where elements of the bids were discussed, and have been extensively involved with legal and commercial discussions. The Joint Administrators have therefore

<<<

 been closely involved with the Accelerated M&A Process undertaken by Management and are satisfied that:
3

 the Accelerated M&A Process was comprehensive and broad enough given previous marketing efforts, the public announcements made by

<<<

 the Group and the restricted time available;
 the materials shared with bidders were appropriate; and
 the overall marketing process was reasonable, suitable for the purpose of addressing the marketing requirements of SIP16, and has and will

<<<

 achieve the best available outcome for the creditors as a whole in the circumstances.
Accordingly, the Joint Administrators consider that we may rely on the marketing conducted.
As at the date of this letter, the status of the Accelerated M

<<<

&A Process can be summarised in the following table. Further details are provided below.

Purpose of the Administrations

The purpose of an administration is to achieve one of the following statutory objectives (in order):

(a)

<<<



rescuing the company as a going concern; or

(b)

achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the

company were wound up (without first being in administration); or

(c)

realising property in order

<<<

 to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors.

At this stage, pending resolution of the discussions in relation to a potential Orlando transaction, it is not possible to determine whether the purpose of the administration

<<<

 of Iona UK will be objective (a) or objective (b). However, the Joint Administrators confirm that the Trent & Tyne Transaction (as defined and described below), once completed, will enable either statutory objective (a) or (b) to be achieved

<<<

, and that the eventual outcome would be the best available outcome for the creditors as a whole in the circumstances.
Attempts by Management during the Accelerated M&A Process to sell the shares of Iona Huntington were unsuccessful. Therefore

<<<

, the purpose of the administration of Iona Huntington will be objective (c).

4

Agreed Pre-Packaged Transaction: Trent & Tyne Transaction
As a result of declining gas prices reducing revenues and the requirement to make additional provision

<<<

 to meet decommissioning liabilities, Iona UK's interests in Trent & Tyne were deemed to have no or negative value to Iona UK. This was borne out by the inability of Iona UK to find a buyer for the interests despite the extensive marketing process

<<<

 undertaken during 2015. Additionally, the Group has been involved in a number of legacy disputes with its operating partner in respect of Trent & Tyne, Perenco UK Limited ( "Perenco").
As a result, Iona UK's strategy was to divest the Trent

<<<

 & Tyne licence to, and agree a consensual settlement of all outstanding claims and counter-claims with, Perenco (the "Trent & Tyne Transaction"). The consideration comprised such consensual settlement and nil cash consideration. On completion

<<<

 of the Trent & Tyne Transaction, the security granted by Iona UK in favour of Nordic Trustee and Britannic Trading Limited over its interests in Trent & Tyne will be released.
The Joint Administrators supported this course of action and believe

<<<

 it meets either statutory objective of the administration of Iona UK being pursued as:
 there was no realistic prospect of an alternative sale for greater value (as borne out by the extensive marketing efforts undertaken by Iona UK and given

<<<

 the continuing decline in gas prices); and
 it releases Iona UK from a number of actual and potential liabilities and also therefore supports efforts to sell the shares of Iona UK.
Further details of the Trent & Tyne Transaction can be found

<<<

 in Appendix III of this letter.
Additional Information for Creditors
Although not a requirement of SIP16, we wish to provide an update on other licences and significant assets to provide greater clarity for the Companies' creditors.
We are

<<<

 currently progressing two specific potential transactions of assets of the Companies. If these transactions are consummated, this may result in gross realisations of up to approximately US$3.0m. However, we note that:
 It is not certain whether

<<<

 these transactions will close and whether there may be any changes to estimated values;
 We anticipate that US$1.8m of the consideration is likely to be deferred and contingent; and  All or part of the disposal proceeds may not be available

<<<

 for distribution to creditors should a sale
of Orlando not be feasible. Pursuant to the agreement reached with DECC, we have undertaken to retain certain disposal proceeds to meet potential costs incurred by DECC relating to Orlando abandonment

<<<

.
Further details are provided below in relation to specific licences and other assets.
Orlando and Kells
The Joint Administrators, together with Management, continue to liaise with several interested parties in respect of a potential sale of

<<<

 the Orlando and Kells licences. Various potential transaction structures are being assessed. Given the status of the development plan for this project, support from key suppliers to the project is considered key to these efforts and every effort

Divestment of the Premier Royalty Entitlement
Iona Huntington owns the following entitlements in relation to the Huntington field in addition to, and separate from, its 15% working interest in the field:
 1.2% royalty entitlement

<<<

 from Premier Oil UK Limited (the "Premier Royalty Entitlement");  0.6% royalty entitlement from Noreco; and  a 0.75% DLE with Eon.
As part of the Accelerated M&A Process the above assets were offered to known specialist buyers of such assets

<<<

, the relevant counterparties to the entitlements as well as potential interested parties for the shares or assets of the Companies. The assets generated a reasonable degree of interest and several offers were submitted and assessed by management

<<<

 and the Joint Administrators for both value and deliverability, the latter with particular regard to the availability of funding and consents required to finalise a transaction.
Discussions with a preferred party are ongoing in relation to

<<<

 the Premier Royalty Entitlement and subject to confidentiality undertakings. Further details will be provided to creditors in due course. Realisation efforts continue in relation to the remaining assets of Iona Huntington.
West Wick
We are

<<<

 in exclusive discussions with a party in relation to a potential sale of Iona UK's interest in the West Wick licence. Discussions are ongoing and are subject to confidentiality undertakings. Further details will be provided to creditors in

<<<

 due course.
Other licences
Iona UK is in the process of withdrawing from or relinquishing the following licences: Ronan & Oran, Fleetwind and Farne & Lundy.
Cash balances
The restricted cash balance as at 22 December 2015 was US$57.1m. The

<<<

 Bond Trustee enforced its security over the restricted cash on 22 December 2015, such that it was no longer an asset of the Companies as at the date of the administration appointment on 6 January 2016. We understand that Nordic Trustee made

<<<

 an interim distribution of US$50m to bondholders on 30 December 2015. The balance is being held by Nordic Trustee, pursuant to authority granted by Bondholders 21 December 2015, as a contingency to meet certain potential costs and expenses

<<<

 of the Administration.
As at 6 January 2016, the unrestricted cash held by the Companies amounted to US$8.5m. This is a floating charge asset and can therefore be applied to meet administration expenses, pay preferential creditors and provide

<<<

 a prescribed part for unsecured creditors.
We will provide further details to creditors on the expected level of such costs and other claims in the Joint Administrators' proposals in due course.
Ongoing Orders
Please note that with effect from

<<<

 the date of our appointment, the Companies will not be responsible for any payment for goods or services supplied to the Companies except against orders which are approved by the Joint Administrators or one of our representatives on our behalf

<<<

.
Please also note that any amounts due to you by either of the Companies for goods and services supplied prior to the date of administration or pursuant to contracts entered into prior to the administrations will rank as an unsecured creditor

<<<

 claim against the relevant company.
For unsecured creditors, we enclose a Statement of Claim form so that you may provide details of the amount owing to you as at the date of our appointment. Please provide copy invoices or other relevant


<<<

6

supporting documentation with your claim form and return it to us by post or email using the contact details provided.
Proposals
We note that the SIP16 states that "when a pre-packaged sale has been undertaken, the Joint Administrators should

<<<

 seek any requisite approval of the proposals as soon as practicable after appointment and, ideally, the proposals should be sent with the notification of the sale."
In this case, we do not consider it to be the best course of action to subm

<<<

 it the Joint Administrators' proposals with this notification as a number of transactions in relation to the Companies' other assets are still being pursued and the structure of those transactions will need to be reflected in the Joint Administrators

<<<

' proposals, together with an indication of likely dividend prospects. As such, we have provided greater disclosure than would ordinarily be the case on other potential transactions and assets in this letter.
Therefore, in accordance with paragraph

<<<

 49(5) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986, the Joint Administrators' proposals will be made available to all creditors within eight weeks of the administration. Furthermore, we may issue supplementary SIP16 notices for any additional

<<<

 pre-packaged transactions should we exchange contracts on such transactions ahead of issuance of the Joint Administrators' proposals

Iona Energy Company (UK) Pic ( "Iona UK") Iona UK Huntington Limited ( "Iona Huntington") - all in Administration (together "the Companies")
Information Disclosure as required by the Statement

<<<

 of Insolvency Practice 16:

Initial Introductions and pre-appointment matters

1. The source of the Joint Administrators' FTI was initially introduced to the Companies by certain

initial introduction

bondholders of the Group. Our engagement

<<<

 was formalised

with Nordic Trustee, as bond trustee for all bondholders.

2. The extent of the Joint Administrators' involvement prior to the appointment

FTI's initial engagement letter was dated 20 February 2015 and a subsequent addendum

<<<

 was dated 1 June 2015. The scope comprised:

 provide an overview on latest short term cash flow forecast for period to 31 March 2015;
 comment on the ability to defer tim ing of commitments and associated implications on the Orlando development

<<<

 plan;
 undertake an assessment of the Orlando development plan, including technical and financial assessment and financials;
 undertake a high level technical assessment of Huntington, the options for extending production and decommissioning

<<<

 costs;
 review the latest financial forecasts for the period to Orlando first oil; and
 assess secured creditor recoveries and provide secured creditor support in any restructuring proposals, proposed corporate transaction and/or refinancing

<<<

 proposals.

From 17 November 2015 to the date of the Companies' administrations, FTI has provided the following services:

 assisting with contingency planning for the potential administration of the Companies;
 assisting management with

<<<

 transaction structuring;  preparing for the administration appointments and
related logistics, including site closure planning and employee notifications; and
 providing general support in the period prior to the administration appointments

<<<

.

3. Alternative course(s) of action considered by the Joint Administrators and the possible financial outcome(s) of the alternative course(s) of action

The principle alternative option with respect to the Trent & Tyne interests would have

<<<

 been to continue marketing Iona UK's interests in Trent & Tyne during the administrations.
However, we were satisfied that the marketing undertaken for Trent & Tyne prior to the administration of Iona UK was adequate and a further period of

<<<

 marketing would have incurred additional costs and run the risk of the existing offer being reduced or withdrawn (particularly given the

11

downward trend in oil and gas prices).
There was a further option to allow the default process under

<<<

 the joint operating agreement in respect of Trent & Tyne to run its course. However, we believe the 'clean exit' afforded by the transfer of the Trent & Tyne interests and settlement with Perenco justified the time and costs of agreeing and

<<<

 documenting the agreement between the parties as it releases Iona UK from a number of potential liabilities and supports the ongoing efforts to sell the shares of Iona UK. A default under the joint operating agreement would not have provided

<<<

 a release from such liabilities.

4. Whether efforts were made to consult with major creditors

The Bondholder Committee, together with the Bond Trustee, was consulted prior to the commencement of, and during, the Accelerated M&A Process to

<<<

 ensure their support for the process.

Management also consulted extensively with major suppliers with respect to the Orlando project to share as much insight as possible on the status of disposal efforts for that licence. Such consultations

<<<

 have ensured that these suppliers have supported, and continue to support, the ongoing process in respect of Orlando.

5. Details of requests made to potential funders to fund working capital requirements

Given the level of cash in the Companies

<<<

, there was no requirement for additional working capital funding.
Funding would have only been needed to develop Orlando. However, given the extensive attempts during 2015 to procure funding for the development of the Orlando project, combined

<<<

 with the continued deterioration in oil prices, we did not think such a strategy was realistic for the Joint Administrators to pursue.

6. Charges registered against the Company See Appendix IV for details. including date these were created

<<<



7. Details of any transactions involving the N/A acquisition of the business or business assets from an insolvency process within the previous 24 months and whether the Joint Administrators were involved

Marketing and valuation of the business

<<<

 and assets

8. Marketing activities conducted prior to appointment and the effect of those activities

Disclosures in relation to marketing activities are set out within the main body of this document.
We also note that the parent's announcement

<<<

 of 18 November 2015 was made available on its website. Given the subsequent press coverage (both online and in print) and industry knowledge of the position of the Companies, and the fact that buyers would likely be industry participants given

<<<

 the OGA consents required, generic online marketing was not considered appropriate in the circumstances.

9. Valuations obtained of the business or We are satisfied that the marketing undertaken in the

the underlying assets

Accelerated M

<<<

&A process and previously (during the

development of the Restructuring Proposal) was

12

Trent & Tyne Transaction

comprehensive and appropriate to support the value reached in respect of Trent & Tyne Transaction (and any other disposals

<<<

 which we may subsequently execute). Accordingly, no formal valuations were carried out on the assets of the Company. Given the marketing testing we considered it appropriate to proceed on that basis.

10. The date of the transaction

Execution

<<<

 of the transaction documentation on 8 January 2016 with completion to follow in due course (see item 15 below for further details).

11. The identity of the purchaser

13. The names of any directors or former directors of the Companies who are involved in the management, financing or ownership of the purchaser, or of any other entity

<<<

 into which any of the assets were / will be transferred

We are not aware of any directors or former directors of the Companies who are involved in the management or ownership of Perenco.

14. Whether any directors of the Companies had given

<<<

 guarantees for amounts due from the Companies to a prior financier and whether that financier is financing the new business

We are not aware of any guarantees provided by the directors of Iona UK to the Group's financiers.

15. Details of

<<<

 the assets involved and the nature of the transaction(s)

The documentation for the Trent & Tyne Transaction was exchanged on 8 January 2016. We expect to be in a position to confirm completion of the transaction in our proposals report. The

<<<

 conditions to completion are:

 consent from OGA (received on 11 January 2015);  execution of security releases (in agreed form); and  execution by relevant third parties of novation and
assignment documentation (also in agreed form).

CRITICAL THINKING AT THE CRITICAL TIMETM

Information Disclosure as required by the Statement of Insolvency Practice 16 ( "SIP16") in relation to the sale of Iona UK's interest in the West Wick licence
Iona Energy

<<<

 Company (UK) Plc ( "Iona UK") Iona UK Huntington Limited ( "Iona Huntington") Both in Administration (together "the Companies")
This appendix sets out the matters as required by SIP16, following the execution of transaction documentation for

<<<

 the sale of Iona UK's interest in the West Wick licence to Chevron North Sea Limited ( "Chevron") on Wednesday, 3 February 2016.
Iona UK holds a 58.73016% interest in the West Wick development licence. Its partner under a Joint Operating Agreement

<<<

, Idemitsu Petroleum UK Ltd. ( "Idemitsu") holds the balancing interest in the asset. The sale to Chevron comprises both the interests of Iona UK and Idemitsu.
Our letter to creditors of 14 January 2016 provided details of disclosures in relation

<<<

 to the pre-packaged sale of Iona UK's Trent & Tyne licence. This statem ent should be read in conjunction with that letter, and considered to be an addendum to that letter.
As noted in our 14 January 2016 letter, the term "pre-packaged sale

<<<

" refers to an arrangement under which the sale of all or part of a company's business or assets is negotiated with a purchaser prior to the appointment of an administrator and the administrator effects the sale immediately on, or shortly after

<<<

, appointment.
The West Wick sale was subject to pre-appointment negotiation with Chevron and their due diligence continued post-appointment. Although the sale documentation was executed approximately 4 weeks following our appointment as administrators

<<<

, we consider that the SIP16 disclosure requirements apply to this transaction.

Initial Introductions and pre-appointment matters

1. The source of the Joint Administrators' initial introduction

FTI was initially introduced to the Companies

<<<

 by certain bondholders of the Group. Our engagement was formalised with Nordic Trustee, as bond trustee for all bondholders.

2. The extent of the Joint Administrators' involvement prior to the appointment

FTI's initial engagement letter was

<<<

 dated 20 February 2015 and a subsequent addendum was dated 1 June 2015. The scope comprised:

 provide an overview on latest short term cash flow forecast for period to 31 March 2015;
 comment on the ability to defer tim ing of commitments

<<<

 and associated implications on the Orlando development plan;
 undertake an assessment of the Orlando development plan, including technical and financial assessment and financials;
 undertake a high level technical assessment of Huntington

<<<

, the options for extending production and decommissioning costs;
 review the latest financial forecasts for the period to Orlando first oil; and
 assess secured creditor recoveries and provide secured creditor support in any restructuring

<<<

 proposals, proposed corporate transaction and/or refinancing proposals.

From 17 November 2015 to the date of the Companies' administrations, FTI has provided the following services:

 assisting with contingency planning for the potential

<<<

 administration of the Companies;
 assisting management with transaction structuring;  preparing for the administration appointments and
related logistics, including site closure planning and employee notifications; and
 providing general

<<<

 support in the period prior to the administration appointments.

3. Alternative course(s) of action considered by the Joint Administrators and the possible financial outcome(s) of the alternative course(s) of action

The principle alternative

<<<

 option with respect to the West Wick interests would have been to either:
i. continue marketing the interests following the appointment of administrators over Iona UK; or
ii. seek to relinquish the licence to OGA ( "Oil & Gas Authority).

We

<<<

 were satisfied that the marketing undertaken for West Wick prior to the administration of Iona UK was adequate and a further period of marketing would have incurred additional costs and run the risk of the existing offer being reduced or withdrawn

<<<

 (particularly given the downward trend in oil and gas prices). We did not consider that a further marketing period would have yielded an offer in excess of the Chevron offer.

A relinquishment would have yielded no recovery, and

therefore

<<<

 the sale to Chevron represented better prospects of recovery.

4. Whether efforts were made to consult with major creditors

The Bondholder Committee, together with the Bond Trustee, was consulted prior to the commencement of, and during, the

<<<

 Accelerated M&A Process (as defined and further explained in our letter of 14 January 2016) to ensure their support for the process.

5. Details of requests made to potential funders to fund working capital requirements

Given the level of

<<<

 cash in the Companies, there was no requirement for additional working capital funding.

6. Charges registered against the Company See Appendix IV of our letter dated 14 January 2016. including date these were created

7. Details of any transactions

Marketing and valuation of the business and assets

8. Marketing activities

<<<

 conducted prior to appointment and the effect of those activities

Disclosures in relation to marketing activities of the Companies' business and assets are set out within our letter of 14 January 2016.

We set out below further information

<<<

 specific to West Wick (in addition to the wider marketing process undertaken):

 It was determined in 2014 that a standalone development of West Wick would be marginal at an oil price of $100/barrel.

 In late 2014, it was determined that

<<<

 the most likely value creating option for West Wick would be via either an extended reach drilling or sub-sea tie back to Captain (a platform owned by Chevron).

 Following exploration of those options, Iona UK and Idemitsu subsequently agreed

<<<

 to seek to sell their interests to Chevron.

 OGA granted an extension of requirements to submit development plans or relinquish, to provide further time for a sale to be progressed. This extension was to 31 October 2015.

 Iona UK and Idemitsu

<<<

 held initial meetings with Chevron in March 2015 to discuss sale and purchase options. Discussions continued through to October 2015, when an offer from Chevron was rejected.

 Subsequent to this, alternative sale options were discussed with

<<<

 two other parties. Both declined to

proceed.
 Following the failure of the Companies' refinancing, Chevron resubmitted their offer which was accepted by Iona UK on 11 December 2015.
The above process was in addition to the wider marketing

<<<

 process of the Companies' business and assets. No other interest was received for the West Wick licence.

9. Valuations obtained of the business or the underlying assets

We are satisfied that the marketing undertaken in the Accelerated M&A

<<<

 process and previously (during the development of the Restructuring Proposal) was comprehensive and appropriate to support the value reached in respect of West Wick. Accordingly, no formal valuations were carried out on the assets. Given the

<<<

 marketing testing undertaken, we considered it appropriate to proceed on that basis.
