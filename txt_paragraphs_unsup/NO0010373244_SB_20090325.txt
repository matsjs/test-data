amount and the due, unpaid interest shall bear a 3 months NIBOR + 8.75% p.a. interest rate till the default on payment is repaired. Evaluation of the Proposal According to the Borrower, Oceanteam has done its outmost

<<<

 to avoid the coupon postponement, but due to the unforeseen changes in cash flow from projects on top of the already tight liquidity situation, the Borrower has no other alternatives but asking for a postponement of the Coupon payment. In the

<<<

 opinion of the Borrower, this is the only alternative for all parties. The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the

<<<

 Proposal should be accepted. It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with their own advisers to evaluate the consequences of the Proposal. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Borrower still has challenges

<<<

 going forward and the Borrower might be unable to meet its commitments in the future. For further information about Oceanteam, please also refer to the web site www.oceanteam.no or www.newsweb.no (for press released from the Borrower). The

<<<

 Borrower has engaged Pareto Securities AS as its financial adviser (the "Adviser") with respect to the Proposal. Bondholders may accordingly contact Pareto Securities Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70 for further information. No due diligence

<<<

 investigations have been carried out by the Adviser with respect to the Borrower and the Adviser expressly disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal.

 PROPOSAL AND UPDATE ON THE BORROWER
The following information regarding the operational and financial status o f the Borrower is provided by the Borrower. The Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with

<<<

 such information given from the Borrower.
Background for the proposed coupon postponement
Oceanteam is currently enduring pressure on its cash flow due to further losses on renewable cable installation projects and a postponed start of the

<<<

 time charter for CSV North Ocean 102. The current free cash holdings in the Borrower do not allow for payment of the bond coupon interest on the scheduled coupon payment date of 18 March 2009. The losses on the renewable cable installation

<<<

 projects mainly relate to projects for which contracts were entered into during the start up phase of the Borrower. In the mean time Oceanteam has adapted a much stricter tendering and contract policy that takes on much less risk for the Borrower

<<<

. The mentioned losses and payment delays have stretched the already tight liquidity situation further to the extent that postponing the coupon has become necessary.
In 1Q09 the CSV Bourbon Oceanteam 101 has been in full operation on the Bourbon

<<<

/BP time charter. CSV North Ocean 102 has been delivered by the yard and is currently being mobilized for renewable cable installation projects. 1Q09 has shown a low level of activities in the renewable cable installation market. This was partly

<<<

 due to the season and partly due to the delays on projects. Oceanteam's other business have shown an activity levels as expected.
One of the projects, namely the RWE npower: Rhyl Flats project, has been terminated for convenience by RWE npower

<<<

. The following mediation procedure has led to a settlement that was accepted by Oceanteam in order to avoid long lasting arbitration procedures with an uncertain outcome. The parties in the settlement agreed not to disclose the conditions and

<<<

 amount of the settlement.
The E-ON Alpha Ventus project was delayed due to a technical incident and is being completed at the moment.
Current priorities
Oceanteam is currently negotiating a working capital financing facility with a pledge on

<<<

 certain assets that so far are unencumbered, as security. This facility is expected to become available during May 2009. At the same time a potential sale of a share in one of the Borrower's construction support vessels companies is under negotiation

<<<

. These transactions will provide the Borrower with sufficient cash to bring the Borrower's liquidity situation back to normal.

Going forward
At present the Borrower has an order backlog of EURm 320 and is tendering

<<<

 for further projects. Oceanteam is currently starting up its activities and mobilizing vessels with equipment for the cable installation projects named BritNed, Gjoa, Nord Eon 1 and Bard. For these projects, the vessels CSV North Ocean 102

<<<

, the CLB Explorer and the CLB Installer will be utilized. On the shipping side the new CSV North Ocean 103 will be delivered from the yard in Spain in June 2009.
For the somewhat longer term Oceanteam is investigating possibilities to further

<<<

 enhance its capital structure and to further improve the liquidity position of the Borrower.

Construction status
The Borrower has taken delivery of two vessels from a shipyard in Spain, while two other vessels are still under construction

<<<

 with estimated delivery in June 2009 and April 2010. Oceanteam does not expect to see further delays or cost overruns on these vessels. The table below gives an overview over the Borrower's newbuild fleet, as well as the funding.
