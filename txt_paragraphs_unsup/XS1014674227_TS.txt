 meanings given in the Programme Offering Circular or the Issue Terms (including the Annex), except where the context otherwise requires.
The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors. It is advisable that each potential investor

<<<

 in the Notes determines the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, it is advisable that each potential investor (a) has sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes

<<<

, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Offering Circular or any applicable supplement; (b) has access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate

<<<

, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio; (c) has sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of

<<<

 an investment in the Notes, including where the potential investor's currency is other than euro; (d) understands thoroughly the terms of the Notes and is familiar with the behaviour of the relevant financial markets; and (e) is able to evaluate

<<<

 (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
In connection with the issue of the Notes,

<<<

 Societe Generale (the "Stabilising Manager") (or persons acting on behalf of the Stabilising Manager) may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might

 date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the relevant Tranche of Notes and

<<<

 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. Any such stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the Stabilising Manager (or persons acting on behalf of the Stabilising Manager) in accordance with all applicable laws

RISK FACTORS
The Issuer believes that the riskfactors incorporated by reference herein from pages 15 to 26 o f the Programme Offering Circular and

<<<

 the risk factors set out below may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. All such riskfactors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o fany

<<<

 such contingency occurring.
Risk factors which the Issuer believes may be material for the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are incorporated by reference herein from pages 15 to 26 o f the Programme Offering

<<<

 Circular and set out below.
The Issuer believes that the riskfactors incorporated by reference herein and the risk factors set out below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest

<<<

, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it or which it may not currently be able to anticipate

<<<

. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information incorporated by reference herein or set out elsewhere in this Offering Circular and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
Loss absorption at the point

<<<

 of non-viability of the Issuer and resolution

On 6 June 2012, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a directive providing for the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions

<<<

 and investment firms (the draft "RRD"). The stated aim of the draft RRD is to provide relevant authorities with common tools and powers to address banking crises pre-emptively in order to safeguard financial stability and minimise taxpayers

<<<

' exposure to losses.

The powers provided to "resolution authorities" in the draft RRD include write down/conversion powers to ensure capital instruments (including, but not limited to, instruments included in regulatory capital) fully absorb

<<<

 losses at the point of non-viability of the issuing institution ("RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption"). Accordingly, the draft RRD contemplates that resolution authorities will be required to write down such capital instruments in full on a

<<<

 permanent basis, or convert them in full into common equity tier 1 instruments, immediately before or together with any resolution action is taken (see below). The draft RRD currently provides, inter alia, that resolution authorities shall

<<<

 exercise their write down powers in a way that results in (i) common equity tier 1 instruments being written down first in proportion to the relevant losses and (ii) thereafter, the principal amount of other capital instruments being converted

<<<

 into common equity tier 1 instruments or written down on a permanent basis. Common equity tier 1 instruments may be issued to holders of other capital instruments that are written down.

The point of non-viability under the draft RRD is the

<<<

 point at which the national resolution authority determines that the institution meets the condition for resolution, which is defined as:

(a) the institution is failing or likely to fail, which means:

(i)

the institution has incurred/is

<<<

 likely to incur in a near future losses depleting

all or substantially all its own funds; and/or

(ii)

its assets are/will be in the near future less than its liabilities; and/or

(iii)

the institution is/will be in a near future unable

<<<

 to pay its obligations; and/or

(iv)

the institution requires extraordinary public financial support;

(b) there is no reasonable prospect that a private action would prevent the failure;

7

The draft RRD contemplates that it will be implemented

<<<

 in Member States by 31st December 2014, with the RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption provisions (inter alia) becoming effective as of 1 January 2015.
An additional bail-in tool, which comprises a more general power for resolution authorities

<<<

 to write down the claims of unsecured creditors of a failing institution and/or to convert unsecured debt claims into equity, is expected to be implemented under the RRD as of 1st January 2016.
The draft RRD currently provides that a write

<<<

 down/conversion resulting from the use of the bail-in tool would, in principal, follow the ordinary allocation of losses and ranking in an insolvency of the relevant institution.
The draft RRD currently represents the only official proposal

<<<

 for the implementation in the European Economic Area of the non-viability requirements set out in the press release dated 13th January 2011 issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") entitled "Minimum requirements

<<<

 to ensure loss absorbency at the point of non-viability" (the "Basel III Non-Viability Requirements"). The Basel III Non-Viability Requirements form part of the broader Basel III package of new capital and liquidity requirements intended to

<<<

 reinforce capital standards and to establish minimum liquidity standards for credit institutions.
The Basel Committee originally contemplated implementation of the broader Basel III reforms as of 1st January 2013. However, implementation of

<<<

 these reforms in the European Economic Area has been delayed but will be by way of the CRD IV Directive (as defined in Condition 7(n)) and the CRR (as defined in Condition 7(n)). These texts were published in the Official Journal of the European

<<<

 Union on 27th June 2013. They must be applied from 1st January 2014. CRR contemplates that the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements will be implemented in the European Economic Area by way of the RRD and the RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption

<<<

 provisions. If such statutory loss absorption at the point of non-viability is not implemented by 31st December 2015 then CRR indicates that the European Commission shall review and report on whether a provision should be included in CRR and

<<<

, in light of that review, come forward with appropriate legislative proposals.
It is currently unclear whether RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption, when implemented, will apply to capital instruments (such as the Notes) that are already in issue

<<<

 at that time or whether certain grandfathering rules will apply. If and to the extent that such provisions, when implemented, apply to the Notes, and/or if the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements become applicable to the Notes at any time

<<<

, the Notes may be subject to write down or conversion to common equity tier 1 instruments upon the occurrence of the relevant trigger event, which may result in Noteholders losing some or all of their investment in the Notes. The exercise of

<<<

 any such power or any suggestion or anticipation of such exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the value of the Notes.
In addition to RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption, the draft RRD provides resolution authorities with broader

<<<

 powers to implement other resolution measures with respect to distressed banks, which may include (without limitation) the replacement or substitution of the bank as obligor in respect of debt instruments, modifications to the terms of debt

<<<

 instruments (including altering the maturity and/or the amount of interest payable and/or imposing a temporary suspension on payments) and discontinuing the listing and admission to trading of financial instruments.
The draft RRD is not in

<<<

 final form and changes may be made to it in the course of the legislative process. In addition, as noted above, it is unclear whether the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements could be applied in respect of the Notes ahead of implementation

<<<

 of the RRD. Accordingly, it is not yet possible to assess the full impact of the relevant loss absorption provisions. There can be no assurance that, once implemented, the availability of applicable loss absorption provisions or the
8

taking

<<<

 of any actions currently contemplated or as finally reflected in such provisions would not adversely affect the price or value of a Noteholder's investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes

<<<

. Redemption upon occurrence o f a Tax Event or a Capital Event Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Capital Event (each as defined in Condition 7(n) set out in the Annex to the Issue Terms) but subject in each case to the approval of the

<<<

 SFSA as set out in Condition 7(i) the Bank may, at its option, redeem, all (but not some only) of the Notes upon the terms set out in Condition 7(n). There can be no assurance that Noteholders will be able to reinvest the amounts received upon

<<<

 redemption at a rate that will provide the same rate of return as their investments in the Notes. The interest rate reset could affect the market value of the Notes The Notes will initially bear interest at a Rate of Interest of 2.656 per cent

<<<

. from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Call Date. Unless the Notes are redeemed on or prior to the Call Date, for the Reset Interest Period, the Rate of Interest will reset on the Call Date to the sum of the Five-year Mid

<<<

-Swap Rate and the Margin, all as determined by the Agent on the Reset Interest Determination Date and as provided in the Issue Terms. The Rate of Interest for the Reset Interest Period could be less than the initial Rate of Interest which could

<<<

 affect the market value of an investment in the Notes.
