To the bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001 042552.3 FRN Fairstar Heavy Transport NV Callable Second Secured Bond Issue 2008/2009
Oslo, 10 February 2009
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING - PROPOSED WAIVER IN RESPECT OF

<<<

 FINANCIAL COVENANT REQUIREMENT
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN NO001 0425523 (the "Loan") where Fairstar Heavy Transport N.V. (the "Borrower") is the issuer.
All capitalised

<<<

 terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") entered into on 11 April 2008 between the Borrower and the Loan Trustee, unless otherwise stated in this summons.
The Borrower has approached

<<<

 the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders meeting to consider a request for a waiver to disregard, any effect of any non-cash gain or loss from the change in fair market value of interest rate hedging agreements in connection with the equity

<<<

 covenant. Currently non-cash gains or losses from the periodic revaluation (mark-to-market) of our portfolio of interest rate swap agreements negatively influence Equity Ratio as it is currently calculated. In the last 9 months, there has been

<<<

 a significant drop in U.S. Dollar interest rates. The subsequent non cash effect will cause the Equity Ratio of the Borrower to be below requirements of the Loan Agreement. The Borrower requests a waiver which allows them to disregard the non

<<<

-cash effects of such swap valuations when calculating Equity Ratio under the Loan Agreement clause 14.3 (b).
1. Background
Pursuant to Clause 14.3 (b) of the Loan Agreement the Borrower shall:
"During the term o f the Loan, the Borrower shall

<<<

 (unless the Loan Trustee or the Bondholders ' meeting (as the case may be) in writing has agreed to otherwise) comply with thefollowingfinancial covenants:
(b) ensure that the Group (on a consolidated basis) maintains an Equity Ratio o fminimum

<<<

 30 %. "

Pursuant to Clause 1 of the Loan Agreement, Equity is defined as
"the aggregate book value (on a consolidated basis) o f the Group's total equity in accordance with IFRS minus any senior liability or perpetual liability with a step

<<<

-up treated as equity under IFRS as set out in the then most recent audited consolidated financial statements (or, if no audited consolidatedfinancial statements are prepared, then reference shall be made to unaudited consolidatedfinancial statements

<<<

 (if any) or on the basis o fpro forma consolidatedfinancial statements) o f the Borrower
Pursuant to Clause 1 of the Loan Agreement, Equity Ratio is defined as:
"the ratio o f Equity to Total Assets"
Pursuant to Clause 1 of the Loan Agreement

<<<

, Total Assets is defined as:
"the aggregate book value (on a consolidated basis) o f the Group's total assets which are treated as assets in accordance with IFRS, as set out in the then most recent audited consolidated financial statements

<<<

 (or, if no audited consolidated financial statements are prepared, then reference shall be made to unaudited consolidated financial statements (if any) or on the basis o f pro forma consolidated financial statements) o f the Borrower,"
During

<<<

 2005 and 2006 the Borrower entered into a series interest rate swaps (IRSs) to hedge the fluctuation in LIBOR movements on its debt service. These so called `floating to fixed' interest rate swaps are in accordance with International Financial

<<<

 Reporting Standards (IAS 39), marked-to-market at the last day of each reporting period. Consequently, any resulting gain or loss from the change in fair market value of the hedge are non-cash and unrealized. Because of the borrower's compliance

<<<

 with hedge accounting rules, the movements are recorded through Equity (Cash Flow Hedge Reserve). The balance sheet impact is a financial instrument (either asset or liability) and an increase or decrease in equity. As of December 31, 2008

<<<

, the mark-to-market valuation of those interest rate swap instruments was approximately USD 7.476.846.98 in favour of the swap counterparty, of which approximately USD 3.687.846.98 million will be attributable to the fourth quarter income statement

<<<

.
The interest rate swaps have been entered into well before the bond issue to fix the floating LIBOR interest rates under (i) a USD 60 million loan facility, and (ii) a USD 16 million loan facility to protect stakeholders against negative interest

<<<

 rate fluctuations. It was not foreseen that the unprecedented volatility in the USD credit market would result in significant non-cash, unrealised losses related to these interest rate swaps, particularly when such interest rate swaps have

<<<

 been entered into to protect investors against negative interest rate fluctuations.
2. Further process to strengthen the Borrower's capital situation
The Borrower is currently in the process of raising further equity to ensure that
3

· N

<<<

 O RSK TILLITSM A N N ASA
the Company complies with the financial covenants set out in clause 14.3 (b) of the Loan Agreement. An underwritten equity issue of up to NOK 75 million will take place in February 2009. The proceeds from the offering

<<<

 will be used by the Borrower to redeem outstanding debt obligations. When combined with cash flows generated from current contracts and the Borrower's credit facilities, the Borrower will have secured the liquidity necessary to redeem all of

<<<

 its outstanding bonds no later than 11 October 2009.
In this respect, please find enclosed as Appendix 1 the press release regarding the underwritten equity issue posted on the news release pages of Oslo Stock Exchange (NewsWeb) 25 January

<<<

 2009.
3. The Proposal
The Borrower proposes that it shall be permitted, when computing Equity Ratio for the purpose of calculation in Clause 14.3 (b) to disregard any non-cash gain or loss in the market value of its interest rate swap portfolio

<<<

. As a result the accounts will reflect the actual cash disbursements for interest hedging purposes. The change of the Equity Ratio calculation will provide a more accurate Equity Ratio position including the maintenance of the Equity Ratio

<<<

 covenant of 30%.
An approval will avoid a possible technical breach under the Loan Agreement, which might affect relationships between the Borrower and others who do not otherwise consider these unrealized, non-cash gains and losses as material

<<<

 to the financial condition of the Borrower. In the opinion of the Borrower, avoiding these unintended consequences will benefit the Borrower and therefore ultimately benefit the Bondholders.
According to the Loan Agreements, the proposed consent

<<<

 requires approval from the Bondholders. Such approval ought to be given if the Bondholders find the overall risk assessment and risk compensation (if any) to be fair.
As compensation to the Bondholders, the Borrower offers a one-time waiver

<<<

 fee of 0.50% (flat) of the face value of the Bonds, payable to the Bondholders based on their holdings as of the date of the Bondholders Meeting on the fifth banking day following the Bondholders meeting, provided that the Bondholders Meeting

<<<

 grants the proposed waiver.
The Loan Trustee notes that the Borrower offers compensation to the Bondholders through a flat waiver fee for the proposed waiver. Further, the Borrower, is about to implement a share issue which will both strengthen

<<<

 the Equity of the Borrower, which will counter-effect and possibly eliminate the need for the waiver after a short period of time. The proceeds from the share issue will also serve to repay the Loan which matures on 12 October 2009. Although

<<<

 the proposed waiver relaxes the requirements to the Equity of the Borrower, the planned share issue will, when completed strengthen the Equity. The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from

<<<

 the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently

evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
