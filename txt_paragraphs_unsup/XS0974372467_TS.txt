RISK FACTORS
Prospective investors should read

<<<

 the entire Prospectus and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. All of these factors are contingencies

<<<

 that may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring.
Factors which the Issuer believes may be materialfor the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated

<<<

 with the Notes are also described below.
The Issuer believes that thefactors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in

<<<

 connection with the Notes for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it and which it may not currently be able to anticipate.
The following is a general discussion

<<<

 o f certain risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes. In particular, it does not consider an investor's specific knowledge and/or understanding about risks typically associated with the Issuer

<<<

 and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes, whether obtained through experience, training or otherwise, or the lack o f such specific knowledge and/or understanding, or circumstances that may apply to a particular investor.
Words and expressions

<<<

 defined in the "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes" below or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same meanings in this section, unless otherwise stated. References to a numbered "Condition"shall be to the relevant Condition in the Terms and

<<<

 Conditions o f the Notes.
Risks relating to the Issuer
The Group is exposed to a number of risks, which it manages at different organisational levels. The categories of risk are as follows:
 Credit risk: Credit risk is the risk of losses arising

<<<

 because counterparties or debtors fail to meet all or part of their payment obligations. Credit risk includes the risk of losses if a sovereign state encounters financial difficulties, or losses because of political decisions on nationalisation

<<<

 and expropriation, for example.
 Market risk: The risk of loss because the fair value of the Group's assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items varies with changes in market conditions.
 Liquidity risk: The risk of loss because the Group

<<<

's funding costs increase disproportionately, lack of funding prevents the Group from establishing new business, or lack of funding ultimately prevents the Group from meeting its obligations.
 Operational risk: The risk of loss resulting from

<<<

 inappropriate or inadequate internal processes, human or system errors, or external events. It includes legal risk.
 Insurance risk: All types of risk in the Danica group (which consists of the Issuer's subsidiary, Forsikringsselskabet Danica

<<<

, Skadeforsikringsaktieselskab af 1999, which is the parent company of Danica Pension Livsforsikringsaktieselskab and its respective subsidiaries), including market risk, life insurance risk and operational risk.
 Pension risk: The risk of

<<<

 a pension shortfall in the Group's defined benefit plans that requires it to make additional contributions to cover pension obligations to current and former employees.
10

Regulatory changes could materially affect the Issuer's business
The

<<<

 Issuer is subject to financial services laws, regulations, administrative actions and policies in Denmark and in each other jurisdiction in which the Issuer carries on business. Changes in supervision and regulation, in particular in Denmark

<<<

, could materially affect the Issuer's business, the products and services offered or the value of its assets. Although the Issuer works closely with its regulators and continually monitors the situation, future changes in regulation, fiscal

<<<

 or other policies can be unpredictable and are beyond the control of the Issuer. The Issuer willface increased capital and liquidity requirements as a result o f the new Basel III Framework
The final versions of CRR and the CRD IV Directive

<<<

 (for the purposes of this "Risk Factors" section, in each case as defined in the risk factor headed "Loss absorption at the point of non-viability of the Issuer and resolution") adopted in June 2013 will enter into force by 1 January 2014.

<<<

 The framework implements among other things the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposals imposing stricter capital and liquidity requirements upon banks ("Basel III") in the EU. Each of CRR and the CRD IV Directive covers a wide range

<<<

 of prudent requirements for banks across EU member states, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), leverage ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements

<<<

. The CRD IV Directive covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual risk assessment) and other measures such as the combined capital buffer requirements, SIFI definition, governance and remuneration requirements

<<<

.
The CRD IV Directive comes into force through implementation in the Danish Financial Business Act, whereas CRR applies directly without implementation in national law. The European Banking Authority ("EBA") will propose detailed rules through

<<<

 binding technical standards during the second-half of 2013 and 2014 for many areas including, inter alia, liquidity requirements and certain aspects of capital requirements.
The DFSA has also made orders against the Issuer concerning its use

<<<

 of the internal ratings-based approach in capital adequacy calculations, as set out in the "Description of the Danske Bank Group" section. The Issuer does not agree with the DFSA's orders and has appealed to the Company Appeals Board.
See the

<<<

 "Description of the Danske Bank Group" for a description of the impact on the Group of the new capital and liquidity requirements and, if the Issuer is unsuccessful it its appeal to the Company Appeals Board, the consequences of the orders

<<<

 from the DFSA.
The Group may have to pay additional amounts under deposit guarantee schemes or resolution funds
In Denmark and other jurisdictions, deposit guarantee schemes and similar funds ("Deposit Guarantee Schemes") have been implemented

<<<

 from which compensation for deposits may become payable to customers of financial services firms in the event a financial services firm is unable to pay, or unlikely to pay, claims against it. In most jurisdictions in which the Group operates

<<<

, these Deposit Guarantee Schemes are funded, directly or indirectly, by financial services firms which operate and/or are licensed in the relevant jurisdiction. Revised legislation regarding the Danish Deposit Guarantee Scheme (Bank Package

<<<

 IV (as defined below) and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive) redefines the Danish scheme as a premium based scheme such that the participating banks' payments to the scheme will be more stable every year in profit and loss terms. The premium

<<<

 payments will stop when a target level of 1 per cent. of covered deposits has been reached. The future target level of funds to be accumulated in Deposit Guarantee Schemes and resolution funds across different EU countries is still under consideration

<<<

 in the political negotiations regarding the RRD (for the purposes of this "Risk Factors" section, as defined in the risk factor headed "Loss absorption at the point of non-viability of the Issuer and resolution") and in discussions on a single

<<<

 resolution fund according to the proposal for a regulation establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single

<<<

 Resolution Fund published by the European Commission on 10 July 2013 (the "SRM"). The final political agreement of RRD and SRM is anticipated during 2013 or 2014, to be followed by the entry into force of both proposals and the transposition

<<<

 into national legislation of RRD.
The Group may be affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions
The financial services industry generally prospers in conditions of economic growth, stable geopolitical conditions, capital markets

<<<

 that are transparent, liquid and buoyant, and positive investor sentiment. Each of the
11

Group's operating segments is affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions, which can cause the Group's results of operations and financial

<<<

 position to fluctuate from year to year as well as on a long-term basis.
The general economic environment for the financial sector in Europe was difficult in 2012. The economic headwinds continued with increased uncertainty surrounding the

<<<

 euro and the ability of some European nations to repay their debts. Policy measures and intervention from the ECB and other central banks gradually eased the situation, however. Although many issues remain to be resolved, there is growing confidence

<<<

 that the economic situation in Europe will eventually normalise. Low growth and interest rate levels are still to be expected for some time to come, also in our home markets.
Risks related to the market generally
Set out below is a brief description

<<<

 of certain market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk:
The secondary market generally
The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does

<<<

 develop, it may not be liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. Illiquidity may have a

<<<

 severely adverse effect on the market value of Notes.
Exchange rate risks and exchange controls
Payment of principal and interest on the Notes will be made in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor

<<<

's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of euro

<<<

 or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency or euro may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to euro

<<<

 would decrease (i) the Investor's Currencyequivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (iii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government

<<<

 and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal

<<<

 as measured in the Investor's Currency.
Interest rate risks
Notwithstanding that the rate of interest applicable to the Notes will be reset on the Call Date, an investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest

<<<

 rates during the Initial Period or, as the case may be, during the Reset Interest Period may adversely affect the value of the Notes.
In addition, a holder of securities with a fixed interest rate that will be periodically reset during the

<<<

 term of the relevant securities, such as the Notes, is also exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income.
12

Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with

<<<

 the Notes
The Notes may not be a suitable investmentfor all investors
Each potential investor of the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:


<<<

(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement

<<<

 to this Prospectus;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment

<<<

 portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments, i.e. euro, is different from the currency in which such

<<<

 potential investor's financial activities are principally denominated;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and
(v) be able to evaluate (either alone

<<<

 or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Risks related to the structure of the Notes
The Issuer's

<<<

 obligations under the Notes are subordinated
The Notes will constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer as described in Condition 4 (Status o f the Notes).
The Issuer may issue other subordinated obligations

<<<

 or capital instruments that rank or are expressed to rank senior or junior to the Notes, in each case as regards the right to receive periodic payments on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital

<<<

 on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer will be required to pay its depositors, its unsubordinated creditors and its other subordinated creditors other than the present

<<<

 or future claims of creditors that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes in full before it can make any payments on the Notes. If this occurs, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining after these payments

<<<

 are made to pay amounts due under the Notes.
Reduction and cancellation o f the Notes
Until 1 January 2014 or, if later, the date on which none of the Existing Tier 2 Capital Notes is outstanding, the shareholders of the Issuer may, upon the

<<<

 occurrence of a Reduction Event and pursuant to Condition 6 (Reduction o fAmounts o fPrincipal and Unpaid Interest), reduce and cancel (inter alia):
(A) on a pro rata basis all or part of any of its arrears of interest (howsoever defined) 

<<<

(together with any additional interest amounts (howsoever defined)) under its other Tier 2 Capital and any of its other instruments (if any) expressed to be ranking pari passu therewith and all or part of any accrued but unpaid interest under

<<<

 the Notes and its other Tier 2 Capital and any of its other instruments expressed to be ranking pari passu therewith and issued on or after the Issue Date; and
(B) all or part of the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes on a pro rata

<<<

 basis with the outstanding nominal amount of all of its other Tier 2 Capital and any of its other instruments (if any) expressed to be ranking pari passu therewith,
13

provided that the requirements set out in Condition 6 (Reduction o f Amounts

<<<

 o f Principal and Unpaid Interest) are met. Investors should note that, while such reduction is not common, it is an appreciable risk and is not limited to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Danish resolution regimes
In Denmark, certain

<<<

 schemes were introduced in recent years to facilitate the orderly resolution of distressed banking institutions. The current Danish banking schemes do not contain any provisions that contemplate a statutory write down (or other similar impairment

<<<

) of subordinated bank liabilities such as the Notes. The schemes, however, allow, inter alia, the Danish government to establish a new bank to take over all the assets and liabilities after the initial haircut, if applicable, from failing banks

<<<

, excluding the failing bank's equity and subordinated capital (such as the Notes), before initiating bankruptcy proceedings against the failing bank. If the Issuer were to become subject to a resolution regime pursuant to such schemes, the

<<<

 Holders may lose some or all of their investment in the Notes. See "Bank Packages" in "Description of the Danske Bank Group" below for a further description of these schemes. It should also be noted that it is currently unclear whether one

<<<

 or more of these schemes will be replaced (in whole or in part) by the proposals outlined in the draft RRD (as defined below) and SRM.
Loss absorption at the point o fnon-viability o f the Issuer and resolution
On 6 June 2012, the European

<<<

 Commission published a legislative proposal for a directive providing for the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the "RRD"). The stated aim of the draft RRD is

<<<

 to provide relevant authorities with common tools and powers to address banking crises pre-emptively in order to safeguard financial stability and minimise taxpayers' exposure to losses.
The powers provided to "resolution authorities" in the

<<<

 draft RRD include write down/conversion powers to ensure capital instruments (including Tier 2 capital instruments such as the Notes) fully absorb losses at the point of non-viability of the issuing institution. Accordingly, the draft RRD contemplates

<<<

 that resolution authorities will be required to write down such capital instruments in full on a permanent basis, or convert them in full into common equity tier 1 instruments ("RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption"), before any resolution action

<<<

 is taken (see below). The draft RRD currently provides, inter alia, that resolution authorities shall exercise the write down power in a way that results in (i) common equity tier 1 instruments being written down first in proportion to the

<<<

 relevant losses and (ii) thereafter, the principal amount of other capital instruments (including Tier 2 capital instruments such as the Notes) being reduced on a permanent basis. Common equity tier 1 instruments may be issued to holders of

<<<

 other capital instruments that are written down.
The point of non-viability under the draft RRD is the point at which the national resolution authority determines if the institution meets the condition for resolution, which is defined as:


<<<

(a) the institution is failing or likely to fail, which means:
(i) the institution has incurred/is likely to incur in a near future losses depleting all or substantially all its own funds; and/or
(ii) the assets are/will be in a near future

<<<

 less than its liabilities; and/or
(iii) the institution is/will be in a near future unable to pay its obligations; and/or
(iv) the institution requires public financial support;
(b) there is no reasonable prospect that a private action would

<<<

 prevent the failure; and
(c) a resolution action is necessary in the public interest.
The draft RRD contemplates that it will be implemented in Member States by 31 December 2014, with the RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption provisions (inter

<<<

 alia) becoming effective as of 1 January 2015.
14

An additional bail-in tool, which comprises a more general power for resolution authorities to write down the claims of unsecured creditors of a failing institution and/or to convert unsecured

<<<

 debt claims into equity, is expected to be implemented under the RRD as of 1 January 2018.
The draft RRD currently provides that a write down/conversion resulting from the use of the bail-in tool would, in summary, follow the ordinary allocation

<<<

 of losses and ranking in an insolvency of the relevant institution.
The draft RRD currently represents the only official proposal for the implementation in the European Economic Area of the non-viability requirements set out in the press release

<<<

 dated 13 January 2011 issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") entitled "Minimum requirements to ensure loss absorbency at the point of non-viability" (the "Basel III Non-Viability Requirements"). The Basel

<<<

 III Non Viability Requirements form part of the broader Basel III package of new capital and liquidity requirements (as described above under "Basel III Framework" and in more detail under "European implementation of the Basel III Framework

<<<

" in "Description of the Danske Bank Group" below) intended to reinforce capital standards and to establish minimum liquidity standards for credit institutions.
The Basel Committee contemplated implementation of the Basel III reforms as of 

<<<

1 January 2013. However, implementation of these reforms in the European Economic Area has been delayed but will be by way of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and

<<<

 investment firms ("CRD IV Directive") and the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms ("CRR"). These texts were published in the Official Journal of the

<<<

 European Union on 27 June 2013. They must be applied from 1 January 2014. CRR contemplates that the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements will be implemented in the European Economic Area by way of the RRD and the RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption

<<<

. If such statutory loss absorption at the point of non-viability is not implemented by 31 December 2015 then CRR indicates that the European Commission shall review and report on whether a provision should be included in CRR and, in light of

<<<

 that review, come forward with appropriate legislative proposals.
It is currently unclear whether RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption, when implemented, will apply to capital instruments (such as the Notes) that are already in issue at that time

<<<

 or whether certain grandfathering rules will apply. If and to the extent that such provisions, when implemented, apply to the Notes, and/or if the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements become applicable to the Notes at any time, the Notes may

<<<

 be subject to write down or conversion to common equity tier 1 instruments upon the occurrence of the relevant trigger event, which may result in Holders losing some or all of their investment in the Notes. The exercise of any such power or

<<<

 any suggestion or anticipation of such exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the value of the Notes.
In addition to RRD Non-Viability Loss Absorption, the draft RRD provides resolution authorities with broader powers to implement

<<<

 other resolution measures with respect to distressed banks, which may include (without limitation) the replacement or substitution of the bank as obligor in respect of debt instruments, modifications to the terms of debt instruments (including

<<<

 altering the maturity and/or the amount of interest payable and/or imposing a temporary suspension on payments) and discontinuing the listing and admission to trading of financial instruments.
The draft RRD is not in final form and changes

<<<

 may be made to it in the course of the legislative process. In addition, as noted above, it is unclear whether the Basel III Non-Viability Requirements could be applied in respect of the Notes ahead of implementation of the RRD. Accordingly

<<<

, it is not yet possible to assess the full impact of the relevant loss absorption provisions. There can be no assurance that, once implemented, the fact of applicable loss absorption provisions or the taking of any actions currently contemplated

<<<

 or as finally reflected in such provisions would not adversely affect the price or value of a Holder's investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.
Notes subject to optional redemption

<<<

 by the Issuer or upon the occurrence o f a Special Event
Subject as provided herein, in particular to Condition 7.7 (Conditions to redemption etc. prior to Maturity Date), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all (but not some only) of the

<<<

 Notes on the Call Date at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon. Subject as aforesaid, the Issuer may also,
15

at its option, at any time redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes at their Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Capital Event.
An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to

<<<

 redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.
The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its

<<<

 cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed

<<<

 and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
Limited enforcement events
The Notes will contain limited enforcement events

<<<

 relating to:
(i) non-payment by the Issuer of any amounts due under the Notes. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 10 (Enforcement Events) and subject as provided below, a Holder may institute proceedings in Denmark

<<<

 in order to recover the amounts due from the Issuer to such Holder; and
(ii) the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 10 (Enforcement Events), the Notes will become due and

<<<

 payable at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon.
A Holder may not itself file for the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Risks related to the Notes generally
Because the Notes are held by or on behalf

<<<

 o f Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on the clearing system procedures for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in the Global Notes, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes

<<<

. While the Notes are in global form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.
While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment

<<<

 obligations under the Notes by making payments to a common depositary. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes

<<<

. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in such a Global Note.
Meetings o fHolders and modification
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain provisions

<<<

 for calling meetings of Holders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Holders including Holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Holders who voted

<<<

 in a manner contrary to the majority.
In addition, the Issuer may, subject to Condition 7.7 (Conditions to redemption etc. prior to Maturity Date), make any modification to the Notes, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the Agency Agreement

<<<

 and/or the Deed of Covenant which is not prejudicial to the interests of the Holders without the consent of the Holders. Any such modification shall be binding on the Holders.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks and may be lowered, suspended

<<<

, withdrawn or not maintained
16

Each of S&P and Fitch is expected to assign a credit rating to the Notes. In addition, each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch has assigned credit ratings to the Issuer as described in "Overview of the Notes" above

<<<

. These ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes or the standing of the Issuer.
A rating is not a recommendation

<<<

 to buy, sell or hold securities and any rating agency may revise, suspend or withdraw at any time the relevant rating assigned by it if, in the sole judgement of the relevant rating agency, among other things, the credit quality of the Notes

<<<

 or, as the case may be, the Issuer has declined or is in question. In addition, there is no guarantee that any rating of the Notes and/or the Issuer will be maintained by the Issuer following the date of this Prospectus. If any rating assigned

<<<

 to the Notes and/or the Issuer is revised lower, suspended, withdrawn or not maintained by the Issuer, the market value of the Notes may be reduced.
Change o f law
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes will be governed by the laws of England

<<<

, except for Condition 4 (Status o f the Notes), Condition 6 (Reduction o fAmounts o f Principal and Unpaid Interest), Condition 7.2 (Early redemption upon the occurrence o f a Tax Event), Condition 7.3 (Early redemption upon the occurrence

<<<

 o f a Capital Event) and Condition 10 (Enforcement Events) which shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, Danish law. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of England

<<<

 or Denmark or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act withholding may affect payments on the Notes
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") impose a

<<<

 new reporting regime and, potentially, a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to (i) certain payments from sources within the United States, (ii) "foreign passthru payments" made to certain non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply

<<<

 with this new reporting regime, and (iii) payments to certain investors that do not provide identification information with respect to interests issued by a participating non-U.S. financial institution. Whilst the Notes are in global form and

<<<

 held within the clearing systems, in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that FATCA will affect the amount of any payment received by the clearing systems. However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries

<<<

 in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial

<<<

 institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment) with any information, forms,

<<<

 other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements

<<<

 related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. The Issuer's obligations

<<<

 under the Notes are discharged once it has paid the clearing systems, and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the hands of the clearing systems and custodians or intermediaries. Prospective

<<<

 investors should refer to the section "Taxation - Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act."
Notes where denominations involve integral multiples: Definitive Notes
The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum denomination of EUR 100,000 plus

<<<

 one or more higher integral multiples of EUR 1,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples of EUR 100,000. In such a case a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which

<<<

 is less than EUR 100,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in respect of such holding (should Definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of

<<<

 the Notes such that its holding amounts to a denomination.
If Definitive Notes are issued, Holders should be aware that Definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of EUR 100,000 may be illiquid and difficult

<<<

 to trade.
Interests o f the Joint-Lead Managers
17

Certain of the Joint-Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future, engage in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services

<<<

 for, the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.

OVERVIEW OF PROVISIONS RELATING

<<<

 TO THE NOTES WHILE IN GLOBAL FORM
Words and expressions defined in "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes" herein shall have the same meanings in this "Overview o fProvisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form ".
Temporary Global Note

<<<

 exchangeable for Permanent Global Note
The Notes will initially be in the form of the Temporary Global Note, without Coupons, which will be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg

<<<

. Interests in the Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable, in whole or in part, for interests in the Permanent Global Note, without Coupons, which will also be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear

<<<

 and Clearstream, Luxembourg, on or after the Exchange Date, upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership. Interest payments in respect of the Notes cannot be collected without such certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership.
Whenever

<<<

 any interest in the Temporary Global Note is to be exchanged for an interest in the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer shall procure (in the case o f first exchange) the prompt delivery (free o f charge to the bearer) of the Permanent Global

<<<

 Note, duly authenticated, to the bearer of the Temporary Global Note or (in the case of any subsequent exchange of a part of the Temporary Global Note) an increase in the principal amount of the Permanent Global Note in accordance with its

<<<

 terms against:
(i) presentation and (in the case of final exchange) surrender of the Temporary Global Note to or to the order o f the Fiscal Agent; and
(ii) in either case, receipt by the Fiscal Agent of a certificate or certificates of non

<<<

-U.S. beneficial ownership,
within seven days o f the bearer requesting such exchange.
The principal amount o f the Permanent Global Note shall be equal to the aggregate o f the principal amounts specified in the certificates of non-U.S. beneficial

<<<

 ownership; provided, however, that in no circumstances shall the principal amount o f the Permanent Global Note exceed the initial principal amount o f the Temporary Global Note.
The Outstanding Principal Amounts o f the Notes represented by

<<<

 the Permanent Global Note shall be equal to the aggregate of the original principal amounts specified in the certificates of non-U.S. beneficial ownership as adjusted to reflect any reduction pursuant to Condition 6 (Reduction o fAmounts o

<<<

 fPrincipal and Unpaid Interest) and/or any reduction as otherwise required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer; provided, however, that in no circumstances shall the Outstanding Principal Amounts o f the

<<<

 Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note exceed the initial principal amount o f the Temporary Global Note.
Permanent Global Note exchangeable for Definitive Notes
Interests in the Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable, in whole

<<<

 but not in part only and at the request o f the bearer o f the Permanent Global Note, for Definitive Notes, if:
(i) Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other relevant clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period o

<<<

 f fourteen days (other than by reason o f legal holidays) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or in fact does so; or
(ii) any of the circumstances described in Condition 10 (Enforcement Events) occurs.
Interests in the Permanent

<<<

 Global Note will also become exchangeable, in whole but not in part only and at the request o f the Issuer, for Definitive Notes if, by reason o f any change in the laws o f Denmark, the Issuer will be required to make any withholding or deduction

<<<

 from any payment in respect of the Notes which would not be required if the Notes are in definitive form.
Definitive Notes will have attached thereto at the time o f their initial delivery Coupons.
21

Whenever the Permanent Global Note is

<<<

 to be exchanged for Definitive Notes, the Issuer shall procure the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of such Definitive Notes, duly authenticated and with Coupons attached, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note to the bearer of the Permanent Global Note against the surrender of the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent within thirty days of the bearer requesting

<<<

 such exchange.
Each Definitive Note shall state that its Outstanding Principal Amount may, subject to Condition 6 (Reduction o f Amounts o f Principal and Unpaid Interest), be reduced pursuant to Condition 6 (Reduction of Amounts o f Principal

<<<

 and Unpaid Interest) or reduced as otherwise required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer and that details thereof may be obtained during normal business hours at the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent

<<<

.
The Permanent Global Note also provides, inter alia, that:
(i) if Definitive Notes have not been delivered in accordance with the terms of the Permanent Global Note by 6.00 p.m. (London time) on the thirtieth day after the day on which such

<<<

 Permanent Global Note becomes due to be exchanged; or
(ii) if the Permanent Global Note (or any part thereof) becomes due and payable in accordance with the Terms and Conditions or the date for final redemption of the Permanent Global Note

<<<

 has occurred, and, in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due with all accrued interest thereon has not been made on the due date for payment by 6.00 p.m. (London time) on such due date,
then the Permanent Global

<<<

 Note will become void in accordance with its terms but without prejudice to the rights conferred by the Deed of Covenant.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes
The Terms and Conditions applicable to any Definitive Note will be endorsed

<<<

 on that Note and will consist of the Terms and Conditions set out under "Terms and Conditions of the Notes" below.
The Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes represented by one or more Global Notes will differ from those Terms and Conditions

<<<

 which would apply to the Notes were they in definitive form to the extent described in this "Overview of Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form".
Each Global Note will contain provisions which modify the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 of the Notes as they apply to the relevant Global Note. The following is a summary of certain of those provisions:
Payments: The Holder of a Global Note shall be the only person entitled to receive payments in respect of the Notes represented

<<<

<<<

 as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. Rights hereunder shall be in addition to all other rights provided by law. No notice or demand

The Group has two channels through which it grants mortgage loans: 

<<<

(i) Realkredit Danmark A/S; and (ii) the Issuer itself including bank subsidiaries.

The mortgage loans on the Realkredit Danmark A/S platform are funded through the issuance of mortgage bonds according to the Danish Mortgage-Credit Loans and

<<<

 Mortgage-Credit Bonds, etc. Act and executive orders issued by the Danish FSA (the "DFSA").

Realkredit Danmark A/S currently issues mortgage covered bonds only through the Capital Centres of Realkredit Danmark A/S.

Shareholders' equity

The

<<<

 Issuer's shareholders' equity was DKK 138 billion (EUR 18.5 billion) as at the end of 2012 against DKK 126 billion (EUR 16.9 billion) at the end of 2011.3

At year-end 2012, the Issuer's authorised and issued share capital totalled DKK 10,

<<<

086,200,000 (EUR 1,352 million) based on 1,008,620,000 shares of DKK 10 (EUR 1.34) each. The Issuer's shares are listed on the NASDAQ OMX, Copenhagen.

On 30 October 2012 the Issuer announced that its Board of Directors had resolved to launch

<<<

 an offering of new shares in order to raise approximately DKK 7 billion (EUR 938 million)4 in new equity through an accelerated book building process. The offering of 76,880,966 new shares of DKK 10 (EUR 1.34) each represented approximately

<<<

 8.3 per cent. of the Issuer's registered share capital before the capital increase and accounts for approximately 7.6 per cent. of the Issuer's registered share capital following completion of the capital increase. The final subscription price

<<<

 was DKK 93 (EUR 12.47) per new share, raising gross proceeds of DKK 7,149,929,838 (EUR 958,461,331) for the Issuer, and thus increasing the Issuer's share capital of nominal DKK 768,809,660 (EUR 103,060,358). Following the capital increase

<<<

, the share capital of the Issuer consists of 1.008.620.000 shares of nominal value DKK 10 (EUR 1.34) each, equal to a nominal value of DKK 10.086.200.000 (EUR 1,352,073,782).

At year-end 2012, the Issuer had approximately 327,000 shareholders

<<<

. According to the Danish Companies Act, shareholders must notify a company if their shareholding exceeds 5 per cent. of the company's share capital or higher percentages divisible by 5. Three shareholder groups have notified the Issuer that

<<<

 they hold more than 5 per cent. of its share capital at the end of 2012:



A.P. Mller and Chastine Mc-Kinney Mller Foundation, Copenhagen, held a total of (directly

and indirectly) 22.84 per cent. of the share capital of which A.P. Mller

 LP)

held 5.06 per cent. of the share capital.

In addition, on 27 February 2013 Cevian Capital II Master Fund LP announced that it had increased its holding of shares in the Issuer whereby its holding of shares amounts to 51,174,252 shares

<<<

 in the Issuer of a nominal value of DKK 511,742,520, equivalent to 5.07 per cent. of the Issuer's share capital. The aforementioned holding and major shareholder announcement related only to Cevian Capital II Master Fund LP and did not include

<<<

 any holding of shares by Cevian Capital II Co-Investment Fund LP, Cevian Capital II Co-Investment No. 3 LP, Icahn Partners L.P., Icahn Partners Master Fund L.P., Icahn Partners Master Fund II L.P., Icahn Partners Master Fund III, L.P. and High

<<<

 River Limited Partnership.

On 6 March 2013 Realdania announced that it had sold 52,000,000 shares in the Issuer and thus now owned less than 5 per cent. of the share capital and voting rights of the Issuer. After the sale, Realdania owns 

<<<

49,582,485 shares, equivalent to 4.91 per cent. of the Issuer's share capital.

Accordingly, the Issuer currently has two shareholder groups that hold more than 5 per cent. of its share capital:



A.P. Mller and Chastine Mc-Kinney Mller

<<<

 Foundation, Copenhagen, hold a total of (directly

and indirectly) 22.84 per cent. of the share capital of which A.P. Mller-Maersk A/S directly

holds 20 per cent.; and



Cevian Capital II Master Fund LP holds 5.07 per cent. of the share

 capital.

The Issuer estimates that more than 45 per cent. of its share capital is held by investors outside of Denmark. Most foreign investors are based in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Capital and Solvency

Pursuant to the Danish

<<<

 Act No. 67 of 3 February 2009 on State Capital Injections in Credit Institutions etc., as amended by the Consolidated Act. No. 876 of 15 September 2009, Act No. 516 of 12 June 2009, Act No. 1273 of 16 December 2009 and Act No. 556 of 21 December

<<<

 2010, (the "Credit Act"), a scheme has been set up whereby the Danish state will offer to inject state funded tier 1 hybrid capital and/or to underwrite issues of tier 1 hybrid capital for Danish banks and mortgage credit institutions. The

<<<

 capital injections will be in the form of tier 1 hybrid capital without a set maturity and a possibility for redemption after three years. Redemption will be subject to approval from the DFSA.

At the general meeting of the Issuer held on 

<<<

4 March 2009, the shareholders authorised the Board of Directors to apply for and implement a tier 1 hybrid capital injection from the Danish state. In May 2009, the Issuer and Realkredit Danmark A/S received subordinated loan capital from the

<<<

 Danish state in the form of hybrid core capital of approximately DKK 24 billion (EUR 3,224 million)5 and approximately DKK 2 billion (EUR 269 million)6, respectively. The subordinated loans have strengthened the capital base, and the Group

<<<

 is better prepared to withstand losses that any further negative economic developments may cause. In May 2012, the subordinated loan capital of approximately DKK 2 billion (EUR 269 million) for Realkredit Danmark A/S was repaid. In contrast

<<<

 to the three-year redemption limitation described above, the Issuer's subordinated loan capital can only be redeemed at the earliest on 11 April 2014, i.e. 5 years after the issue date thereof. The following table below shows the total capital

<<<

 ratio, tier 1 capital ratio and core tier 1 capital ratio excluding hybrid capital. The second table shows the risk-weighted assets, subordinated debt and hybrid capital. The interest rate (defined as "annual yield") on the loans from the Danish

 state is 9.265 per cent. per annum, with an annual premium of 0.5 of

 option. The interest rate will increase if the Issuer pays dividends in excess of DKK 5.5 billion (EUR 0.74 billion) per annum.
Pursuant to the agreement on state-funded capital injection between the Issuer and the Danish state, dated 5 May

<<<

 2009 (the "State-funded Hybrid Agreement"), the Issuer is subject to, amongst other things, restrictions on capital reductions, share repurchases and the terms of new and existing share issues, restrictions on the distribution of dividends

<<<

, restrictions on the use of funds to capitalise businesses in violation of the Credit Act and certain conditions concerning executive pay and bonuses. The State-funded Hybrid Agreement is annexed to the Articles of Association which are available

At 31 December 2012, the total capital ratio was 21.3 per cent., with a core tier 1 capital

<<<

 ratio of 14.5 per cent. and a tier 1 capital ratio of 18.9 per cent.

At the end of 2012, the Group's risk-weighted assets ("RWA") amounted to DKK 819 billion (EUR 109.8 billion), against DKK 906.0 billion (EUR 121.9 billion)7 at the end of

<<<

 2011. The decline in RWA of DKK 87 billion (EUR 12 billion)8from 2011 was caused primarily by the disposal of conduit loans and other portfolio changes.

The Group's capital base consists of tier 1 capital (equity capital and hybrid capital

<<<

 after deductions) and tier 2 capital. At 31 December 2012, the capital base amounted to DKK 174 billion (EUR 23.3 billion)8, and the total capital ratio was 21.3 per cent. The core tier 1 capital ratio stood at 14.5 per cent.

The Group's strong

<<<

 financial position was confirmed by the EBA's capitalisation test of European banks, which was published in December 2011 and again in a final report in October 2012. This test was conducted to assess European banks' need for recapitalisation

. As expected, the Group passed the test with a capital level substantially above the EBA's requirement.

In March 20

13, the Issuer redeemed one subordinated loan of EUR 500 million (DKK 3,727 million)9. In June 2013, the Issuer redeemed one subordinated loan of EUR 500 million (DKK 3,729 million)10. In September 2012, the Issuer issued subordinated debt,

<<<

 comprising tier 2 capital (the "RAC Tier 2 Notes"), of USD 1 billion (DKK 5.7 billion)11 to improve its risk adjusted capital ("RAC") in accordance with S&P's rating methodology criteria. In July 2013, S&P revised its bank hybrid methodology

<<<

, which resulted in the reclassification of the equity content assigned by S&P to the RAC Tier 2 Notes to "minimal" from "intermediate", therefore implying that the RAC Tier 2 Notes can no longer be included in the Issuer's RAC ratio. Accordingly

<<<

, on 18 September 2013 the Issuer launched a cash tender offer in relation to the RAC Tier 2 Notes. The Issuer also announced a variation of the terms and conditions of the RAC Tier 2 Notes to permit an early redemption of the RAC Tier 2 Notes

<<<

, at the option of the Issuer, at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance, as a result of the occurrence of a "Rating Methodology Event". Due to the above change of equity content assigned by S&P to the RAC Tier 2 Notes

<<<

, once such variation becomes effective, the Issuer currently intends to redeem the RAC Tier 2 Notes pursuant to such early redemption right.
Restrictions on Distributions
As a result of the Issuer's participation in the Danish bank packages

<<<

, the Issuer could not distribute dividends for the financial years ended 31 December 2008 and 2009. Since 1 October 2010, and for as long as the Danish state holds hybrid capital in the Issuer, the Group may distribute dividends only if the

<<<

 dividends can be paid in full out of the net profit. The loan agreement with the Danish state also stipulates an increase in the interest rate if annual dividend payments exceed DKK 5.5 billion (EUR 0.74 billion).
The Group aims to resume dividend

<<<

 payments of 40 per cent. of net profit as soon as it is prudent.
Risk Management
Introduction
The Issuer's Rules of Procedure for the Board of Directors and the Executive Board (the "Rules of Procedure") specify the responsibilities of the

<<<

 two boards and the division of responsibilities between them. The Rules of Procedure and the two-tier management structure, which were developed in accordance with Danish legislation, are central to the organisation of risk management and the

<<<

 policy on lending authority limits in the Group.
The Board of Directors lays down overall policies, while the Executive Board is in charge of the Group's day-to-day management. The risk and capital management functions are separate from the

<<<

 credit assessment and credit-granting functions.
Responsibility for the day-to-day management of risks in the Group is divided between Group Finance & Legal, Group Risk Management and the business units. The Group has established a segregation

<<<

 of duties between units that enter into business transactions with customers or otherwise expose the Group to risk on the one hand, and units in charge of overall risk management on the other.
Group Risk Management
Group Risk Management is

<<<

 headed by the Group's chief risk officer ("CRO"), who is member of the Executive Board.
The department has overall responsibility for monitoring the Group's risk policies and for monitoring, following up and reporting on risk issues across

<<<

 risk types and organisational units. Group Risk Management also serves as a resource for referrals from local risk committees.

The department supports and challenges the rest of the risk management organisation in risk management practices and reporting. It serves as secretariat for the All Risk Committee.

<<<

 Senior staff from the department also chair the Risk Model and Parameter Committee, which monitors the Group's use of risk models, results of backtests and changes to parameters; the Operational Risk Committee, which evaluates the management

<<<

 of the Group's key operational risks; and the Product Risk Committee, which reviews risk related to possible new products. A specialised department in Group Risk Management is responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of operational risks.

<<<


In addition, the department has overall responsibility for setting the group-wide risk appetite and policies, for reviewing the approval and follow-up processes in the business units' lending books, and for monitoring and reporting on the Group

<<<

's consolidated lending portfolio - including the determination of portfolio limits for specific industries and countries.
Group Risk Management is also responsible for facilitating the quarterly process of calculating and consolidating the

<<<

 impairment of credit exposures.
A unit within the department is responsible for developing credit rating and valuation models and for ensuring that they are available for day-to-day credit processing at the business units and that they meet

<<<

 statutory requirements. A separate unit is responsible for backtesting and validating credit risk parameters in collaboration with the business units.
Group Finance & Legal
Group Finance & Legal is headed by the Group's chief financial officer

<<<

 ("CFO"), who is member of the Executive Board. The department is responsible for the Group's financial reporting, budgeting and strategic business analysis, including the tools used by the business units for performance follow-up and analysis

<<<

.
The department is also in charge of the Group's investor relations, capital structure, capital allocation, regulatory matters and relations with international rating agencies.
It is also responsible for the Group's solvency, RWA, leverage

<<<

 ratio and capital allocation and the Group's internal capital adequacy assessment process ("ICAAP").
Within Group Finance & Legal, Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring liquidity risk and funding needs. Group Treasury also ensures that

<<<

 the Group's structural liquidity profile enables the Group to comply with the limits and meet the targets set by the Board of Directors and the All Risk Committee as well as regulatory and prudential requirements.
Furthermore, Group Treasury

<<<

 is responsible for asset liability management, private equity activities and long-term funding activities.
Business units
The business units' mandate to originate and accumulate risk exposure for the Group in their daily work is regulated by

<<<

 risk policies, instructions and limits. The Group strives to cultivate a corporate culture that supports and enforces the organisation's objective to undertake selected risks according to guidelines that have been agreed upon.
Responsibility

<<<

 for all business-related risks is with the heads of the business units and the heads of the operations and services areas. Their responsibilities extend across national borders, thus risk management is centralised by business segment. The segment

<<<

-based organisation enables risk management processes to be tailored to the various customer segments and to be aligned across borders. Lending authorities for specific customer segments and products are granted to the individual business units

<<<

. Credit decisions exceeding the delegated authorities are referred to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors as required.
48

The business units carry out all the fundamental tasks required for sound risk management and controls. These

<<<

 tasks include updating the information about customers that is used in risk management tools and models as well as maintaining and following up on customer relationships.
Each business unit is responsible for preparing documentation before

<<<

 undertaking business transactions and for recording the transactions properly. Each unit is also required to update information on customer relationships and other issues as necessary.
The business units must also ensure that all risk exposures

<<<

 comply with specific risk limits as well as the Group's other guidelines.
Certain risk areas, such as market risk and liquidity risk, are still managed centrally at the group level.
Increased attention from local regulators - especially where

<<<

 activities are organised in local legal entities led the Group to strengthen governance structures for risk management from a local perspective. In the new organisation, country managers and local risk officers are responsible for ensuring

<<<

 compliance with local rules and regulations. Local risk committees as well as asset and liability management committees have also been set up where they are relevant.
Legal Proceedings
Owing to its business volume, the Group is continually

<<<

 a party to various lawsuits and disputes. In view of its size, the Group does not expect the outcome of pending lawsuits and disputes to have any material effect on its financial position.
Bank Packages
With effect from 1 October 2010 the Act

<<<

 on Financial Stability (Chapter 4a of the Danish Act No. 1003 of 10 October 2008 on Financial Stability, as amended by Consolidated Act No. 875 of 15 September 2009, Act No. 516 of 12 June 2009, Act No. 1273 of 16 December 2009, Act No. 72

<<<

1 of 25 June 2010, Act No. 1556 of 21 December 2010 and Act No. 619 of 14 June 2011, Act No. 273 of 27 March 2012, Act No. 1231 of 18 December 2012 and Act No. 1287 of 19 December 2012, and as further amended from time to time (the "Act on Financial

<<<

 Stability")) was amended inter alia to allow for a controlled winding-up of a distressed bank through the Financial Stability Company which is known as "Bank Package III". The resolution scheme is voluntary and contains no general state guarantee

<<<

 of creditors.
The intention of the winding-up procedures is to wind up a distressed bank faster than under the traditional bankruptcy procedures. The procedures do not alter the risk for the creditors, which is that under both the winding-up

<<<

 procedures and the traditional bankruptcy procedures, the creditors may lose all or part of their claims.
The Act on Financial Stability was further amended with effect from 23 June 2011 in order to allow for the Guarantee Fund for Depositors

<<<

 and Investors to contribute with a financial inducement to encourage a sound bank to take over all activities of a distressed bank, including all unsubordinated and unsecured claims. On 25 August 2011 a number of consolidation initiatives was

<<<

 agreed upon by the vast majority of the political parties in the Danish Parliament ("Bank Package IV"). Bank Package IV provides for a strengthening of the compensation scheme in order to create greater incentives for sound banks to wholly

<<<

 or partly take over a bank in distress. In particular, Bank Package IV provides for the Danish state to contribute in the compensation scheme with an amount up to the equivalent of the haircut that would have been imposed on any state guaranteed

<<<

 bonds that were issued by the bank in distress. Contrary to Bank Package III, the unsubordinated and unsecured senior creditors will not suffer any loss if Bank Package IV is applied.
New Capital and Liquidity Regulations
New regulations for

<<<

 the financial sector are being proposed in the EU and beyond. The Group follows this process closely and supports measures that strengthen the resilience of the sector and its ability to support economic growth. The Group is of the opinion

<<<

 that the Basel III guidelines generally meet this criterion.
49

European implementation o f the Basel III Framework
The final versions of CRR and the CRD IV Directive (for the purposes of this "Description of the Danske Bank Group" section

<<<

, in each case as defined in the risk factor on page 16 of this Prospectus headed "Loss absorption at the point of non-viability of the Issuer and resolution") adopted in June 2013 will enter into force by 1 January 2014. The framework implements

<<<

 among other things the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposals imposing stricter capital and liquidity requirements upon banks ("Basel III") in the EU. Each of CRR and the CRD IV Directive covers a wide range of prudent requirements

<<<

 for banks across EU member states, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), leverage ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements. The CRD IV Directive

<<<

 covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual risk assessment) and other measures such as the combined capital buffer requirements, SIFI definition (as defined below), governance and remuneration requirements

<<<

.
The CRD IV Directive comes into force through implementation in the Danish Financial Business Act, whereas CRR applies immediately without implementation in national law. The European Banking Authority ("EBA") will propose detailed rules through

<<<

 binding technical standards during the second-half of 2013 and 2014 for many areas including, inter alia, liquidity requirements and certain aspects of capital requirements.
Under the CRD IV Directive and the Basel III framework, the minimum

<<<

 capital requirement for common equity tier 1 ("CET1") (which does not include hybrid capital) will be phased in gradually from the current 2 per cent. RWA to up to 9.5 per cent. in 2019. The 9.5 per cent. requirement will include a "capital

<<<

 conservation buffer requirement" of 2.5 per cent. and a "countercyclical buffer requirement" of 0-2.5 per cent. in addition to the minimum requirement of 4.5 per cent. The countercyclical buffer requirement will apply in periods of excess lending

<<<

 growth in the economy and can vary for each jurisdiction. If a bank does not maintain these buffers (in excess of the 4.5 per cent. CET1 minimum requirement), restrictions will be placed on its ability to pay dividends and make other payments

<<<

.
For each systemically important financial institution ("SIFI") there will be additional capital requirements on top of the minimum requirements. In Denmark a SIFI expert committee has been established by the minister for business and growth

<<<

. In its report, the committee recommended that the Issuer should be considered a Danish SIFI and that, among other things, an additional CET1 capital requirement of 3.5 per cent. on top of the CRD IV requirements should be applied. Political

<<<

 negotiations have not been finalised yet.
The framework also contains stricter requirements for the quality of capital that may count as CET1 capital and for the calculation of RWA. The Group estimates that the effect of CRR and the CRD IV

<<<

 Directive on its core tier 1 capital ratio at 30 June 2013 (after having taken the recent DFSA orders on RWA into account) will be a reduction of about 1.8 percentage points when the rules are fully phased in in 2018. The reduction entails

<<<

 changes in various elements. The Group assumes that the deduction requirement for Danica Pension under the EU Financial Conglomerates Directive will continue. The Group expects clarification in Danish legislation in the second half of 2013

<<<

. See Interim Report - First Half 2013 for further detail.
As regards liquidity, the Basel Committee proposed two liquidity ratios in December 2012: (i) the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") and the Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"). The LCR

 stipulates that banks must have a liquidity buffer that ensures a survival horizon of at least 30 calendar days in the case of a seriously stressed liquidity situation. The NSFR is intended to ensure a sound funding structure by promoting an

<<<

 increase in long-dated funding. The NSFR stipulates that at all times banks must have stable funding equal to the amount of their illiquid assets for one year ahead.
In January 2013, the Basel Committee issued revisions to its guideline for

<<<

 the LCR. The revisions include a phasing-in of the minimum requirement in which it will be set at 60 per cent. in 2015 and rise in equal annual steps to 100 per cent. on 1 January 2019. The revisions also include an expansion of the pool of

<<<

 level 2 liquid assets that can be counted in the liquidity buffer and a reduction of the weights assigned to certain liquidity outflows.
In Europe, the focus is on the LCR, but the definition of the LCR is still awaiting additional technical

<<<

 guidance from the EBA. Nevertheless, it is of great significance in the measurement of the Group's liquidity buffer with the LCR that the CRD IV Directive proposal enables most of the Group's holdings of covered bonds,
50

including Danish

<<<

 mortgage bonds, to be classified as level 1 liquid assets, on par with Danish government bonds, for example.
It is unclear how the EU authorities will choose to incorporate or modify the Basel Committee's revisions to the LCR in any future

<<<

 revisions to CRR. The Basel Committee's revisions are therefore not incorporated in the Group's reported LCR. If the Basel Committee's revisions are to be incorporated in CRR, and if the EBA still enables most of the Group's holdings of covered

<<<

 bonds, including Danish mortgage bonds, to be classified as level 1 liquid assets, these revisions are expected to have a positive effect on the Group's LCR.
With an LCR of 132 per cent. at the end of June 2013, the Group complied with the

<<<

 LCR requirement. The Group also complied with all other liquidity requirements. Stress tests show that the Group has sufficient liquidity buffer for the coming 12 months. Solvency II (insurance)
Once the new international insurance solvency

<<<

 rules, Solvency II, take effect, not expected before 2016, the requirements for capital strength in the insurance area will be the focus of attention. The rules are intended to protect customers' funds and will generally increase the capital

<<<

 requirements. Danica is well-prepared for the new rules. Danica is closely monitoring the work on the coming EU solvency rules, Solvency II which, among other things, are set to change the existing volume-based capital requirement to a capital

<<<

 requirement that more accurately reflects the risks involved in the operation.
Solvency II was previously set to take effect at 1 January 2014. However, in the autumn of 2012 the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority ("EIOPA

<<<

") announced that this is no longer realistic. Instead, EIOPA expects the new rules to take effect at 1 January 2016. The postponement is due to the many remaining unresolved issues that are holding up the legislative process. A central unresolved

<<<

 issue is the treatment of long-term guarantees. Despite the lingering uncertainty as to the effective date of Solvency II, in 2012 Danica continued preparing for the transition to Solvency II. It is not yet possible to predict what Danica's

<<<

 capital requirements will be under Solvency II as the amounts of long-term guarantees, among other factors, are of great significance to the coming capital requirements. However, Danica Pension does not expect the company's excess core capital

<<<

 to change significantly under the new rules once implemented.

Recent Developments
Danske Bank has received orders from the DFSA
On 17 June 2013, the DFSA issued orders to Danske Bank concerning its use of the internal ratings-based approach

<<<

 in capital adequacy calculations (the IRB approach) and solvency need calculations.
Apart from the order in relation to exposures on other institutions, Danske Bank does not agree with the orders and has appealed to the Company Appeals Board

<<<

.
The D FSA's orders
The DFSA has given Danske Bank four orders that can be summed up as follows:
 With effect from 31 December 2013, increase Corporate Risk Weight excluding counterparty risk by 10 percentage points compared to Q4 2012. In

<<<

 this connection, Danske Bank can reduce Pillar II add-ons.
 With effect from 30 June 2014, ensure that Through The Cycle Probability of Default (TTC PD) values for exposures with counterparty risk reflect the increase for the remaining corporate

<<<

 portfolio. In the meantime, Danske Bank must include an add-on in the solvency requirement.
 With effect from 30 June 2013, an order to set aside additional capital in its solvency need calculations to cover risks deriving from exposures to

<<<

 other institutions.
 With effect from 30 June 2013, an order to remove a deduction from the solvency need.
Consequences o f the orders
Without prejudice to the appeal referred to above, Danske Bank has begun implementing the new requirements

<<<

.
Over time, the net effect of the orders would be a rise in risk-weighted assets of around DKK 100 billion relative to the figure for Q2 2013 DKK 779 billion (EUR 104 billion)12.
Another consequence of the orders would be an increase in Danske

<<<

 Bank's capital requirement (Pillar I requirement) of DKK 8 billion (EUR 1.1 billion), from DKK 62 billion (EUR 8.3 billion) to DKK 70 billion (EUR 9.4 billion) calculated at 30 June 2013. There will be a corresponding reduction in Pillar II

<<<

 add-ons.
Calculated at 30 June 2013, the total capital ratio would be around 19.2 per cent. (the actual reported figure at 30 June 2013 was 21.8 per cent.), and the solvency need ratio under the Basel I transitional rules would be 10.0 per

<<<

 cent. (the actual reported figure at 30 June 2013 was 11.3 per cent.).
The DFSA's decision is available at www.danskebank.com/ir.
Management changes - New Chief Executive Officer
On 16 September 2013, the Board of Directors appointed Thomas

<<<

 F. Borgen as new Chief Executive Officer. Thomas F. Borgen replaced Eivind Kolding who resigned with effect as of 16 September 2013. Thomas F. Borgen has been employed with the Danske Bank Group since 1997 and comes from the position as member

<<<

 of Danske Bank's Executive Board responsible for Corporate & Institutional Banking. These areas will for the time being continue to be a part of Thomas F. Borgen's field of responsibility.

SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE
The Joint-Lead Managers have, pursuant to a Subscription Agreement

<<<

 (the "Subscription Agreement") dated 1 October 2013, jointly and severally agreed to subscribe and pay for the Notes at the issue price of 99.964 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes. The Issuer will pay a commission to the Joint

<<<

-Lead Managers pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. The Issuer will also reimburse the Joint-Lead Managers in respect of certain of their expenses, and has agreed to indemnify the Joint-Lead Managers against certain liabilities incurred in

<<<

 connection with the issue of the Notes. The Subscription Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances prior to payment to the Issuer.
United States of America: Regulation S Category 2; TEFRA D
The Notes have not been and will not be

<<<

 registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in the preceding sentence have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the

<<<

 Securities Act.
The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or its possessions or to U.S. persons, except in certain transactions permitted by U.S. Treasury regulations

<<<

. Terms used in the preceding sentence have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Treasury regulations thereunder.
Each Joint-Lead Manager has agreed that, except as permitted by the Subscription Agreement

<<<

, it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the Issue Date (the "distribution compliance period") within

<<<

 the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons and that it will have sent to each distributor, dealer or person to which it sells the Notes during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting

<<<

 forth the restrictions on offers and sales o f the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the respective meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities

<<<

 Act.
In addition, until forty days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes, any offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements

<<<

 o f the Securities Act.
United Kingdom
Each Joint-Lead Manager has represented and agreed that:
(a) Financial promotion: it has only communicated or caused to be communicated, and will only communicate or cause to be communicated, any invitation

<<<

 or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning o f section 21 o f the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the

<<<

 Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 would not, if the Issuer was not an authorised person, apply to the Issuer; and
(b) General compliance: it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets

<<<

 Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
Denmark
Each Joint-Lead Manager has represented and agreed that it has not offered or sold and will not offer, sell or

<<<

 deliver the Notes directly or indirectly in Denmark by way of a public offering, unless in compliance with the Danish Consolidated Act No. 982 of 6 August 2013 on Trading in Securities, as amended, and any Executive Orders issued thereunder

<<<

 and in compliance with Executive Order No. 984 of 6 August 2013 to the Danish Financial Business Act.
58

General No action has been or will be taken in any country or jurisdiction by the Issuer or the Joint-Lead Managers
that would permit

<<<

 a public offering of the Notes, or possession or distribution of any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Persons into whose hands this Prospectus comes are required

<<<

 by the Issuer and the Joint-Lead Managers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in or from which they purchase, offer, sell or deliver the Notes or have in their possession or distribute such offering

<<<

 material, in all cases at their own expense.
The Subscription Agreement provides that the Joint-Lead Managers shall not be bound by any of the restrictions relating to any specific jurisdiction (set out above) to the extent that such restrictions

<<<

 shall, as a result of change(s) or change(s) in official interpretation, after the date hereof, of applicable laws and regulations, no longer be applicable but without prejudice to the obligations of the Joint-Lead Managers described in the

<<<

 paragraph headed "General" above.
59

TAXATION
The following is a general description of relevant tax considerations and is not to be regarded as a complete tax analysis of all tax issues related to the Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes

<<<

 should consult their professional tax advisers if they are in doubt about their own tax position.
Denmark Taxation
According to the Danish tax laws in effect as of the date of this Prospectus, (i) payments of interest or principal amounts to

<<<

 any holder of a Note are not subject to taxation in Denmark, (ii) no withholding tax will be required on such payments and (iii) any gain realised upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note will not be subject to taxation in Denmark. This

<<<

 tax treatment applies solely to holders of the Notes who are not subject to full tax liability in Denmark or included in a Danish joint taxation scheme or do not carry on business in Denmark through a permanent establishment.
EU Savings Directive

<<<


Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction

<<<

 to an individual resident in that other Member State or to certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period

<<<

 they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries

<<<

). A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
The European Commission has proposed certain amendments to the Directive, which may, if implemented

<<<

, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above.
In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favour of automatic information exchange

<<<

 under the Directive.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") impose a new reporting regime and potentially a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to certain payments

<<<

 to (i) any nonU.S. financial institution (a "foreign financial institution", or "FFI" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a "Participating FFI" by entering into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to provide

<<<

 the IRS with certain information in respect of its account holders and investors or is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA and (ii) any investor (unless otherwise exempt from FATCA) that does not provide information

<<<

 sufficient to determine whether the investor is a U.S. person or should otherwise be treated as holding a "United States Account" of the Issuer (a "Recalcitrant Holder"). The Issuer will be classified as an FFI.
The new withholding regime will

<<<

 be phased in beginning 1 July 2014 for payments from sources within the United States and will apply to "foreign passthru payments" (a term not yet defined) no earlier than 1 January 2017. This withholding would potentially apply to payments

<<<

 in respect of (i) any Notes characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterized as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or after the "grandfathering date", which is the later of (a) 1 July

<<<

 2014 and (b) the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S. Treasury regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are filed with the Federal Register, or which are materially modified on or after the grandfathering

<<<

 date and (ii) any Notes characterised as equity or which do not have a fixed term for U.S. federal tax purposes, whenever issued. If Notes are issued before the grandfathering date, and additional Notes of the same series are issued on or after

<<<

 that date, the additional Notes may not be treated as grandfathered, which may have negative consequences for the existing Notes, including a negative impact on market price.
60

The United States and a number of other jurisdictions have announced

<<<

 their intention to negotiate intergovernmental agreements to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (each, an "IGA"). Pursuant to FATCA and the "Model 1" and "Model 2" IGAs released by the United States, an FFI in an IGA signatory country could

<<<

 be treated as a "Reporting FI" not subject to withholding under FATCA on any payments it receives. Further, an FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction generally would not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA

<<<

) (any such withholding being "FATCA Withholding") from payments it makes. The Model 2 IGA leaves open the possibility that a Reporting FI might in the future be required to withhold as a Participating FFI on foreign passthru payments and payments

<<<

 that it makes to Recalcitrant Holders. Under each Model IGA, a Reporting FI would still be required to report certain information in respect of its account holders and investors to its home government or to the IRS. The United States and Denmark

<<<

 have signed an agreement (the "United States-Denmark IGA") based largely on the Model 1 IGA.
The Issuer expects to be treated as a Reporting FI pursuant to the United States-Denmark IGA and does not anticipate being obliged to deduct any FATCA

<<<

 Withholding on payments it makes. There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will be treated as a Reporting FI, or that it would in the future not be required to deduct FATCA Withholding from payments it makes. Accordingly, the Issuer

<<<

 and financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made may be required to withhold FATCA Withholding if (i) any FFI through or to which payment on such Notes is made is not a Participating FFI, a Reporting FI, or otherwise

<<<

 exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA or (ii) an investor is a Recalcitrant Holder.
Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within the clearing systems, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made

<<<

 under, or in respect of, the Notes by the Issuer, any Paying Agent and the common depositary given that each of the entities in the payment chain beginning with the Issuer and ending with the clearing systems is a major financial institution

<<<

 whose business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Notes. The documentation expressly contemplates the possibility that the Notes may go into definitive

<<<

 form and therefore that they may be taken out of the clearing systems. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. However, Definitive Notes will only be printed in remote circumstances.

<<<


FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different

<<<

 form. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to payments they may receive in connection with the Notes.
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH IRS CIRCULAR 230, EACH TAXPAYER IS HEREBY NOTIFIED

<<<

 THAT: (A) ANY TAX DISCUSSION HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY THE TAXPAYER FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE TAXPAYER; (B) ANY SUCH TAX DISCUSSION WAS

<<<

 WRITTEN TO SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) THE TAXPAYER SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THE TAXPAYER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISER.
The proposed financial

<<<

 transactions tax ("FTT")
The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States

<<<

").
The proposed FTT has very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however

<<<

, be exempt.
Under current proposals the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes where at least one party is a financial

<<<

 institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of
61

circumstances, including (a) by transacting

<<<

 with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating

<<<

 Member States and is the subject of legal challenge. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders o f Notes are advised

<<<

 to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
