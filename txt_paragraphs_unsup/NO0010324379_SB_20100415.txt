001032437.9 - FRN Peterson AS Open Bond Issue 2006/2010 with Call Option
Oslo, 7 April 2010

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - potential early redemption without further notice to the Bondholders.

1. BACKGROUND
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed

<<<

 as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN NO 001032437.9 (the "Loan") issued by Peterson AS (the "Borrower"). All capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement entered into on 27 June

<<<

 2006 (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated in this summons.
On 31 March 2010 the Borrower discharged Borrower's Bonds for an amount of NOK 125 000 000, thus reducing Outstanding Loan from NOK 380 500 000 to NOK 255 500 000. The Borrower

<<<

 has renounced the right to issue new tranches under the Loan. No part of the Loan Security is released in connection with the discharge of Borrower's Bonds.

2. EARLY REDEMPTION
The Borrower has for some time been working to refinance the company

<<<

 and thereby be able to redeem the Loan in full. These efforts seem to have a positive outcome, and an early redemption of the Loan is likely to materialize during the next weeks.
The Borrower assumes that the Bondholders have a preference for

<<<

 the redemption of the Loan at the earliest possible point in time, a preference which is congruent with the views of the Borrower. The redemption could be performed using the provisions in clause 10.2 of the Loan Agreement (the Call Option

<<<

 - amended in a Bondholders meeting 4 June 2009), but using these provisions will probably result a considerable delay of the payment to the Bondholders. The Borrower thus wants to make the redemption as soon as the funds for such repayment

<<<

 are available, and not wait for the notification period of the Call Option to expire.

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
Based on the above it is suggested for the Bondholders to accept that the Borrower - for the period from the Bondholders meeting until 15 June 2010 - may redeem the Loan

<<<

 in full without any further notice to the Bondholders. The actual payment to the Bondholders will be accompanied by a standard notice from Verdipapirsentralen (VPS the Norwegian Securities Depository).

3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
The proposed

<<<

 mechanism for the early redemption seems not to jeopardise the economic or legal interests of the Bondholders, and will provide the Borrower with a certain degree of flexibility to be able to make a full repayment of the Loan at the earliest

<<<

 possible time. The proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation from the Loan Trustee, and the Bondholders should independently evaluate whether the proposal is acceptable.

Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date.

<<<

(i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered).
The individual bondholder may authorise Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case

<<<

 the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post

<<<

 - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the

<<<

 proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Norsk Tillitsmann deems as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other
