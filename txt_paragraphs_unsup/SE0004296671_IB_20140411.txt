A. Background
At the time of issue of the Bonds, it was regarded as important that the ultimate owners of the

<<<

 Company - Mr Thomas von Koch and Mr Christian Kinch - remained in control of the Company. In the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds, change of control is defined as an event that may trigger early redemption of the Bond Loan. At that time there

<<<

 existed only one class of shares, each entitling to one vote. Hence, the definition of Change of Control refers to a situation where the ultimate owners no longer controls at least 50% of the total outstanding shares or control in the Company

<<<

.
As published by the Company on 16 February 2014, the Company is currently inquiring the possibilities for a listing on the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm exchange (the "IPO"). In connection to these inquiries a new class of shares (denominated series

<<<

 A-shares) has been introduced with 10 votes per share. Although the Ultimate Owners will remain in full voting control of the Company also subsequent to the IPO, they may be required to reduce their ownership of the share capital below 50%

<<<

.
Accordingly, it is herewith proposed that the definition of Change of Control in Condition 1 of the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds is amended.
B. Proposal
I. Amendment of the definition of Change of Control in Condition 1 of the Terms and

<<<

D. More information about the right to participate
To be eligible to participate in the written procedure a Holder must as of 2 May 2014 (the "Record Date"):
· be directly registered as owner

<<<

 of a Bond on a Euroclear Account, or · be reported as underlying owner of a Bond by an authorised nominee (förvaltare) on
the debt ledger for nominee registered Bonds produced by Euroclear Sweden AB.
I f you are a H older o f nom inee registered

<<<

 Bonds o r i f som eone else is directly registered as H older o fyour Bonds Owners of Bonds whose Bonds are registered as held by an authorised nominee (förvaltare) in accordance with the Swedish Financial Instruments Account Act in the register

<<<

 kept by Euroclear Sweden AB (CSD) must be reported as underlying owners by the authorised nomi nee as per the Record Date, or be directly registered as owners on the Record Date, to be entitled to participate in the written procedure. Authorised

<<<

 nominees will normally automati cally report the name of their customers in the debt ledger without the need for any particu lar actions from the underlying owner. However, if the Bond is held through several different financial institutions

<<<

, the underlying owner may not automatically be reported as eligible to participate. In such case a re-registration may be required or that the financial institution whose name appears on the debt ledger as owner may be required to vote in its

<<<

 own name on the instructions of the underlying owner.
Owners of Bonds whose Bonds are registered as directly owned by someone else in the reg ister kept by the CSD must ensure that the Bonds are directly registered in their own name in the

<<<

 register kept by the CSD, or vote through an instruction to the financial institution or other person registered as owning the Bonds (and thus has the formal voting right). This might for example be relevant with respect to Bonds that are held

<<<

 through two or more fi nancial institutions.
If you do not know how your Bonds are held or whether you will be registered as eligible to participate we recommend that you contact the financial institution that holds the Bonds on your behalf

<<<

 for assistance, if you wish to participate in the procedure in writing.
