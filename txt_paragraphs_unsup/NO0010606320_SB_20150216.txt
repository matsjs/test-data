1 BACKGROUND
1.1 Introduction

<<<


On 1 October 2014, Noreco informed of expected impairments of its Oselvar and Huntington fields. At the same time the Company informed of uncertainty with respect to whether the Company would be able to meet its financial covenants year-end

<<<

 2014 due to lower production on Huntington. The Company also communicated that the impaiiments are expected to result in significant negative impact on Noreco's cash-flow in 2015 and beyond.
On 15 October 2014, Noreco provided further updates

<<<

, including information about negative developments in the performance of Noreco's producing fields, which had further added to the challenge

in meeting cash covenants, and making it unlikely that the Company would be able to comply with its

<<<

 cash covenants towards the end of 2014 and through 2015.
On 19 November 2014 Noreco reported that it, in order to allow the Company necessary time to explore all alternatives to a financial restructuring and with the belief that such alternatives

<<<

 could create or preserve more values for all stakeholders compared to a restructuring, would seek a deferral of payments due on 9 December 2014 under the Bonds. The deferral was required as the Company in light of its financial position and

<<<

 outlook was unable to make such payments without breaching its cash covenants at the end of 2014 and through 2015 and without prejudicing certain groups of creditors. Following discussions with the Bond Trustee and BAHR and Akin Gump as appointed

<<<

 legal advisors to the Bond Trustee and N M Rothschild Rothschild & Sons Limited as appointed financial advisor (together the "Trustee Advisors"), who in turn discussed with an ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "Ad Hoc Committee"), a summons

<<<

 letter was dispatched on 4 December 2014, whereby Bondholders' Meetings in each of the Bonds were called at the request of Noreco to consider certain waivers and deferrals in this respect.
On 15 December 2014, Noreco reported that it had been

<<<

 informed by the Huntington field operator that production had been further delayed due to an incident during restart of the CATS riser platform, and that the riser platform would be closed at least until 18 December 2014, probably longer. In

<<<

 a subsequent announcement on this topic on 19 December 2014, it was reported that start up could be delayed to the end of January, possibly even longer.
On 15 December 2014, Noreco further reported that its financial situation and outlook had

<<<

 continued to deteriorate due to significant and continued drop in oil prices, increases in projected operating costs and accelerated retention of cash to cover future abandonment costs, and that as a consequence, it would be necessary to also

<<<

 seek a deferral of both interest payments and amortisation payments that were due on the Bonds on 9 December 2014. Given this, the deferral and waiver terms included in the summons of 4 December 2014 could no longer be met. While continuing

<<<

 to pursue opportunities to best preserve values for all stakeholders, the Company found it necessary to accelerate work on an overall financial restructuring, and presented a proposed restructuring involving full conversion of the bond debt

<<<

. The proposal was made in order to maintain going concern, and with the aim of creating a sustainable solution where values could be best preserved and underlying values realised for all financial stakeholders.
Since then, the Company has continued

<<<

 to be in dialogue with the Bond Trustee, the Trustee Advisors and representatives for the Ad Hoc Committee as well as other stakeholders, with the purpose of arriving at an agreed solution for a financial restructuring and a way forward for

<<<

 Noreco. The Ad Hoc Committee represents more than 50% in NOR06 Bond, NOR10 Bond, NOR11 Bond and NOR12 Bond respectively.
The Company's objective for the discussions has been to create a sustainable solution whereby the Company's operations

<<<

 and asset values could be preserved and realised to the benefit of all financial stakeholders.
In parallel the Company has reviewed the planned activities in its licences in light of the current oil price, and has identified a number of actions

<<<

 that have substantially reduced costs and improved the Company's financial situation and outlook. As reported on 4 February, 2015, whereas cash forecast for end 2015 before any bond payments in previous announced proposals was negative NOK

<<<

 12 million, current projections now show positive NOK 214 million.
/ Despite these mitigating actions and the continued discussions, it has not yet been possible to reach consensus from sufficient members of all four bond groups represented

<<<

 in the Ad Hoc Committee for a pre-agreed restructuring proposal. In light of the severity of the Company's financial position, the Board therefore found it necessary to update the market and present a revised restructuring proposal. Such update

<<<

 and revised restructuring proposal was announced on 4 February 2015. The revised proposal is based on the dialogue with Nordic Trustee, the Trustee Advisors and the Ad Hoc Committee representing the four bondholder groups, and is further described

<<<

 in section 2 below. In summary, the proposal entails that the Company will be converting approx. NOK 1.9 billion of bond debt (plus accrued

interest) to equity with approx. NOK 1.2 billion of bond debt remaining on amended terms, including

<<<

 amended maturities, with possible payment-in-kind ("PIK") interests and no fixed amortisations except final maturity in three years, but with "cash sweep" if excess cash should become available. NOR06 will change issuer to Noreco Noiway AS

<<<

 without any recourse to the parent company or other parts of the Group. The three bond loans NORIO, NOR11 and NOR12 will be partially converted into share capital and partially converted into a new NOK 600 million senior secured bond loan of

<<<

 Noreco. Following the proposed conversion, the holders of the converted bonds will own 92 per cent of the outstanding shares of the Company.
The proposal requires the approval by qualified majorities of bondholders in all the four Bonds as

<<<

 well as by a qualified majority of the Company's voting shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting. With respect to the latter, an extraordinary general meeting was summoned on 10 February 2015 and is scheduled to be held on 3 March

<<<

 2015 (the "EGM").
Pending approval of any restructuring, there are a number of outstanding Events of Default under the Bond Agreements which are continuing, including without limitation failure to pay amortisations and interests that were due

<<<

 to the Bondholders on 9 December 2014. The Bond Trustee has not yet declared the Bonds (including accrued interest and expenses) to be due for immediate payment, but has reserved the right to do so at any time.
1.2 Further information

<<<

<<<

2.4 Outstanding issues
Although the Company's proposal is the best estimate relating to a consensual settlement among the stakeholders, the main remaining challenges to achieve an agreed

 stakeholders as proposed herein. · Engagement of certain minor creditor interests.

 herein.

5 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
In the Issuer's opinion, the Proposal represents the best alternative given the current circumstances.

 and the Trustee Advisorss, who in turn have discussed with the Ad Hoc Committee of Bondholders under the Bonds. As of the date of this summons the Ad Hoc Committee has not been able to reach final agreement on the terms of a consensual restructuring

<<<

. The dialogue with the Ad Hoc Committee and its advisors has however provided important feedback, which has resulted in the proposal set out herein, and which is based on a solution that has been discussed between the Bondholder groups and

<<<

 within the Ad Hoc Committee. The work to improve the Company's financial health and safeguard the creditors' and other stakeholders' interests is continuing, and as such in particular, negotiations with the aim to mitigate cash outflows in

<<<

 the Danish licences.

6 NON-RELIANCE

Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by any of the Bond Trustee or the Issuer or any of their respective advisors. The Bondholders must independently evaluate

<<<

 whether the Proposal is acceptable and vote accordingly. The Bond Trustee urges each Bondholder to seek advice in order to evaluate the Proposal.
The Restructuring and the Proposal to the Bondholders, including the financial, business and other

<<<

 assumptions they are based on, may constitute forward-looking statements and facts. Such forwardlooking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that are difficult or impossible

<<<

 to predict and many of which are beyond the Issuer's control. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause the actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
It should

<<<

 be noted that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Issuer may experience financial challenges in the future, and the recovery from the Consideration Shares and remaining Bonds will remain dependent on such forward-looking statements and facts

<<<

, and the general market in which the Issuer operates and the recovery of such market.

 with bondholders

· Although there has been significant progress in these discussions, no solution has been finally reached with all stakeholders to date. Based on the status of the discussions, however, and in light of the severity of the

<<<

 Company's financial position, the Board has nevertheless found it necessary to update the market and present a revised restructuring proposal involving a partial debt-to-equity conversion without further delay
· In order to be implemented,

 the restructuring proposal will need 2/3 approval in both the bondholders' meetings 2 March 2015 and by the shareholders in an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) 3 March 2015
· The ad hoc bondholder committee has furthermore stated that their

 consent to any restructuring proposal will require that other creditors in the Noreco's Danish subsidiaries will need to contribute to a solution. This will be subject to parallel discussions

The proposal - approval needed to avoid bankruptcy
· The updated proposal herein is based on extensive discussions

 with bondholders' advisors, the ad hoc bondholder committee and individual bondholders

· The proposal is a compromise, and an effort by the Company and its advisors to take into account the interest of all bondholders on one side and the shareholders

<<<

 on the other side

· NOR06 will keep its claim and aims at full recovery through the assets and tax balances of Noreco Norway AS
- It is acknowledged that NOR06 is in a special position, mainly due to the value of the tax position, although

 still uncertain whether NOR06 will be able to achieve full recovery

· NOR10, NOR11 and NOR12 will convert -M NOK 1,900 of their principal debt. Additionally, they will share a MNOK 600 bond issued by Noreco ASA. Together with the current shareholders

, they will maintain exposure to several triggers that may increase their recovery:
- Insurance claim. Possibility to sell or pursue - Production rebound - Exploration success from committed wells, e.g. the ongoing Xana well
Sale of Danish assets

<<<

 - Sale of Huntington - Rebound in oil price - Potential upside from Noreco Norway AS - Other M&A

· The proposal, including the debt conversion of -M NOK 1,900 for NOR10, NOR11 and NOR12, assumes that a

· Full commencement of production at Huntington has been further delayed
· Noreco Oil Denmark A/S has reduced its ownership in licence 9/95 (Xana well) on the Danish continental

 shelf from 20.1% to 16% as a mitigating action to reduce cash outflow
· One of the Noreco Group's payment obligations has not been honoured due to the bondholders not giving their consent to cover costs in that entity. This relates to the Danish

 Nini licence where the licence partners have invoked the default provisions in the joint operating agreement
· At the request of the Company the listed shares and bonds were on 21 January 2015 suspended from trading on Oslo Bors
· Due to the

 lower oil price regime, cash outflows that previously were expected to happen in 2015 are now expected to be put on hold/postponed or cancelled by the relevant Noreco Group company and the licence partners -> this will significantly improve

Bankruptcy will be value destructive (1/2)
· In the Company's opinion a bankruptcy of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will have significant negative effects

<<<

 for all the Company's creditors
- A debt negotiation process of Noreco ASA may be an alternative to seek earlier dividend distribution, however, government approval in addition to either unanimity among creditors or a structured solution with

<<<

 the legal minimal requirement of 25 % dividend may prove challenging
· In the event of a bankruptcy recovery from the uncollateralised cash in Noreco ASA for the various bonds is estimated to be in the range of 10-14%, however this will take

<<<

 a long time to recover as no dividend distribution can be expected until all claims have been finally settled with regard to legal basis and justified amount
- For NOR11 and NOR12, the dividend pay-out from the Noreco ASA estate (mainly consisting

<<<

 of uncollateralised cash in Noreco ASA) will be the only realistic source of recovery
- NOR06 is assumed to have a full claim of dividend against ASA even if NOR06 were to take ownership of shares in Noreco Norway, capitalise to secure operations

<<<

 and through their ownership be able to sell all operational activities and receive tax refund from the Norwegian authorities
- Ordinary claims in Noreco ASA related to parent company guarantees issued by Noreco ASA as security for its subsidiaries

<<<

' obligations are estimated to be in the range of MNOK 400-800, whereof MNOK 100-200 is related to Denmark, MNOK 50300 is related to UK, and MNOK 250-300 is related to Norway
· A bankruptcy in Noreco ASA will lead to bankruptcy in Denmark. The

<<<

 estates may pursue a process to increase the value of the insurance claim and timing and recovery for bondholders from Danish estates would remain highly uncertain
· Under the Danish Subsoil Act, a hydrocarbon licence is not available to the

<<<

 recourse of creditors, and therefore cannot be included in or sold by a bankruptcy estate
· A sale of the shares of Noreco Oil (UK) Ltd (owning a participating interest in the Huntington licence) from the bankruptcy estate could provide some

<<<

 recovery to NOR10. Sales price will however be adversely affected if sold now, given the current history of problems at Huntington, the oil price and the seller's distressed situation

Bankruptcy will be value destructive (2/2)
· Upon a bankruptcy

<<<

 in Denmark, the licences may be taken over by the licence partners according to the default rules in the joint operating agreements. Further, the Danish Energy Agency may revoke the licences in their entirety for all licence holders according

<<<

 to the licences and the Subsoil Act in the event of bankruptcy. However, in the event that the pledgees seek to sell the licence shares of the Danish Noreco-subsidiaries due to default, the Danish Energy Agency will not revoke the licence before

<<<

 120 days have passed, to enable the pledgees to transfer the licence shares to the co-licensees or third parties. This will create large claims against the Danish Noreco-subsidiaries
- Any defaulted payment obligations regarding the 9/95 licence

<<<

 (Xana well) can be claimed by Maersk (the licence partners) under the parent company guarantees issued to Maersk (the 9/95 licensees)
- The Danish Energy Agency may call on the parent company guarantees for obligations towards the Danish Energy

<<<

 Agency, for instance if the licence is revoked, and the Danish Energy Agency demands payment from all licence holders for non-fulfilment of work obligations or abandonment obligations under the licences
· There are several unknowns in a bankruptcy

<<<

 of an E&P business relating to authorities in three jurisdictions (Norway, Denmark and UK), such as the scope of the parent company guarantees issued to these states and certain licence partners, potential claims under the joint agreements

<<<

, licence agreements etc.
· A bankruptcy in one part of the group is likely to lead to a domino effect with bankruptcy as possible outcome for other companies in the Noreco Group, for example due to risk of accelerated cash calls and inability

<<<

 to meet all creditors' claims
· No previous bankruptcies in E&P businesses in Norway or Denmark, hence there is some uncertainty as to how relevant laws and regulations will be applied
· The Company has large tax losses carried forward and

<<<

 tax balances which it is uncertain how will be treated in a bankruptcy
14

Key changes to assumptions since updated proposal 15 December 2014
· The spot price for oil has dropped -USD 5 per barrel, with oil forward contracts also down
- Noreco

<<<

's forecast assumption for 2015 reduced from 65 to 55 USD/bbl
· Compared to the NOK, the USD has appreciated with -N O K 0.21/USD to NOKUSD 7.63, whereas the DKK has depreciated with -N O K 0.08/DKK to NOKDKK 1.16 and the GBP has depreciated

<<<

 -N O K 0.10/GBP to NOKGBP 11.49
- Noreco's forecast assumption increased from 7.00 to 7.60 for USDNOK, 1.15 to 1.17 for DKKNOK, and 11.00 to 11.50 for GBPNOK
· Production outlook remains more or less the same, but there is uncertainty with

<<<

 regards to Huntington, where normal production will not resume until the end of February at the earliest
· Due to non-payment default on the Nini licence Noreco's share of oil is taken by the other partners · The oil price drop is on an isolated

<<<

 basis resulting in reduced cash balance year end 2015
- However, the lower oil price regime will also impact the decisions to pursue developments or investments in the projects that Noreco and its licence partners are exposed to
- This means

<<<

 that a significant portion of the 2015 capex/cash outflow will be put on hold/postponed or cancelled. Altogether, this is expected to result in an improved cash position year end 2015 compared to 15 December 2014 presentation

 potential downscaling of activities - Pursue accretive divestments and dispose of non-strategic assets - Farm down of exploration costs - Continue to work with partners to reduce operating costs - Optimise value of Danish portfolio through

<<<

 solvent restructuring efforts currently ongoing - Maintain strong cash management focus to repay debt - Maximise recovery from insurance claim - Utilise tax positions where applicable - Pursue M&A activities

· New shareholders and the Board

<<<

 will review its opportunities and implement the strategies and measures considered to best preserve and create values

· With this focused strategy, the Board and management of Noreco firmly believe that this restructuring proposal and maintaining

<<<

 a going concern is the best available strategy for the stakeholders to maximise recovery/value

The company will do its utmost to achieve a satisfactory position with respect to the Danish
