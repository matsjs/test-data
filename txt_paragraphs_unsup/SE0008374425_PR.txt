Risk factors
Investing in the Bonds involves inherent risks. Thefinancial performance o f the Group and the risks associated

<<<

 with its business are important when making a decision on whether to invest in the Bonds. There is a risk that a number o f riskfactors and uncertainties adversely affect the Group. I f any o f these risks or uncertainties actually occurs,

<<<

 the business, operating results andfinancial position o f the Group could be materially and adversely affected, which ultimately could affect the Group's ability to make payments o f interest and repayments ofprincipal under the Terms and Conditions

<<<

. In this section, a number o f riskfactors are illustrated, namely general risks pertaining to the Group's business operations and material risks relating to the Bonds asfinancial instruments. The risks presented herein are not exhaustive and

<<<

 other risks not discussed herein may also adversely affect the Group, the price o f the Bonds and the Group's ability to service its debt obligations. Further, the riskfactors are not ranked in order o f importance. Potential investors should

<<<

 consider carefully the information contained in this document and make an independent evaluation before making an investment decision.
Risks relating to the Group

1.1

Sensitivity to the economic conditions

The Group is affected by changes

<<<

 in the global economy, which affect the level of investment in the Group's various business areas. There is a risk that a weak economy in Sweden or internationally results in lower market growth for the Group's products and services than what

<<<

 is expected. Consequently, there is a risk that the Group's sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a negative economic trend. The pattern of demand is affected by a number of general factors outside the Group's control, including

<<<

 interest rates, exchange rates, inflation and deflation levels, taxes, public finances and investment plans, local market conditions, other economic factors, investment plans of other industries, and uncertainties concerning future economic

<<<

 prospects. In the event of an economic downturn, there is a risk that the Group will not be able to maintain its historic sales or its current profitability level.

1.2

The Group operates in a competitive market

The Group's long-term growth

<<<

 and profit depend on its ability to continue to develop products and services that are competitive in terms of quality and price. If the Group is not able to continue to develop and sell competitive products and services, the Group's earnings

<<<

 and financial position may be adversely affected. At present, the Group is facing significant competition on both the Swedish and international markets. The main competitors are companies from Europe and North America.

4

There is a risk

<<<

 that some of the Group's current or future competitors have greater resources than the Group and that they will use these to increase their market shares through aggressive pricing strategies. There is a risk that this will lead to the Group

<<<

 being forced to lower its prices to remain competitive and avoid losing market shares. If the Group is subjected to increased price competition or loses market shares, there is a risk that this has an adverse effect on its business activities

<<<

, earnings and financial position.

1.3

International business

The Group has currently operations in seven countries, and is likely to enter into new markets in the forthcoming years, of which some are undergoing rapid development and transformation

<<<

 into a market economy. The Group is thereby exposed to such risks associated with international business, such as trade policy decisions in the form of the introduction or expansion of customs duties on the Group's markets, which could significantly

<<<

 affect the Group negatively. There are also differences in regulations between countries, limited legal protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries, different accounting standards and tax systems, different payment terms

<<<

 between different countries, and the risk of political instability. Each of the above risks could have an adverse effect on the Group's business activities, earnings and financial position.

1.4

Dependence on the development of new markets

<<<



There is a risk that the Group is and may become active on markets which will have a slower market growth than expected. If the risk is materialized, the Group's sales and earnings may be adversely affected.

1.5

Size of the underlying market

<<<



The demand for the Group's global product and service offerings on the vehicle inspection market are largely determined by the vehicle fleet in the local market. There is a risk that a significant reduction in the vehicle fleet on markets

<<<

 in which the Group operates, due for instance to a reduction in direct imports and new sales of vehicles, as well as an increase in deregistrations of vehicles, will have an adverse effect on the Group's business activities, earnings and financial

<<<

 position.

Under current EU directives, EU member states must have legislation stipulating that the period within which the first inspection must take place may not exceed four years, and thereafter the inspection interval may not exceed two

<<<

 years (inspection interval 4-2-

5

2). Sweden has currently inspection interval 3-2-1. In US states, the inspection interval for new vehicles varies between 2 and 7 years. If the inspection intervals in countries or US states in which the

<<<

 Group operates were to change so that the period between inspections is increased, this could have a negative impact on the Group's activities, results and financial position.

1.6

Political decisions

The demand for the Group's products and

<<<

 services is dependent on a continued political will to implement and maintain emission and safety testing of vehicles. There is a risk that this political will could, for one or another reason, be changed on certain markets resulting in new

<<<

 EU directives, national laws, regulations, etc. There is also a risk that governmental power in certain regions might strive for exclusively domestic or government-owned control of products and services on the vehicle inspection market. In

<<<

 addition, there is a risk that the Group also is affected by political decisions that generally affect the market, such as subsidies favoring competing technologies. Furthermore, there is a risk that the Group will not be able to maintain its

<<<

 historic sales in the future.

1.7

Prices and availability of input materials

The Group's business activities are dependent on certain input materials such as electronic circuits and highly complex system components. The Group cannot control

<<<

 all factors affecting pricing of the inputs that the Group is dependent on. There is a risk that the Group will at one time or another not have access to the quantity of these inputs needed to complete the manufacturing that the Group has been

<<<

 contracted to perform.

If the risk is materialized it will have a negative impact on the Group's business earnings and financial position.

1.8

New Technology

For the products within vehicle emission testing, there is a risk that the market

<<<

 decreases as integrated vehicle control functions become more advanced. If the demand for follow-up emissions inspections decreases, there is a risk that this will have an adverse effect on the demand for measuring equipment at inspection stations

<<<

 and automotive work-shops. In the longer term, there is a risk that current automotive technology is replaced by new technology such as fuel cells, which minimize exhaust emissions. There is a risk such a development leads to a decrease in

<<<

 demand for the Group's products and services in vehicle emission testing. Over time, there is a risk that

6

the automotive industry integrates electronic driver logs into the vehicle's on-board computer. Such a development risk having an

<<<

 adverse effect on the Group's sales and earnings.
The sectors in which the Group operates are furthermore subject to rapid technological developments. There is thus a risk that new technologies and products will be developed that circumvent

<<<

 or replace the Group's intangible assets.

1.9

Change in vehicle inspection models

In certain countries and in some US states the vehicle inspection market today is based on a centralized model in which the initial inspection must, by law

<<<

, be performed by a designated vehicle inspection station that is accredited by a government authority. If there is a change in legislation that would lead to a decentralized market in which workshops would also be able to perform the initial

<<<

 vehicle inspection, it would risk having an adverse effect on the Group's sales.

1.10

Acquisition
An important part of the Group's strategy is to work actively with acquisitions of companies and businesses. Strategic acquisitions will continue

<<<

 to be part of the growth strategy in the future.
An acquisition involves business risks and financial risks. For example, there is a risk that the acquired company is not able to keep existing customers, key employees and/or suppliers. There

<<<

 is a risk that the Group will not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, or that the integration process becomes more costly and time consuming than anticipated. There is also a risk that predicted synergy savings are not achieved

<<<

 as anticipated or not achieved at all. There is a risk that these and other acquisition related risks have a negative impact on the Group's business, profit and financial status.

1.11

Key individuals
There are a number of key persons in senior

<<<

 positions within the Group. These individuals bring a high level of expertise and experience to the Group, which is important for the development of the Group's business. If one or more of these key persons were to leave the Group, there is

<<<

 a risk this has an adverse effect on its business activities, earnings and financial position.

7

A number of employees in the Group are directly or indirectly involved in the development of new services and products. If the Group were to

<<<

 fail to recruit and/or maintain qualified personnel, this could have negative consequences for its business, earnings and financial position.
Inspection personnel at Opus Bilprovning are certified to perform vehicle inspections and meet the

<<<

 requirements set by Swedac. Certified inspection personnel are essential to obtaining Swedac accreditation to conduct vehicle inspections. If the Group were to fail to recruit, train and/ or maintain certified personnel, this could also have

<<<

 negative consequences for the Group's business, earnings and financial position.

1.12

Dependence on a small number of projects and customers
At present, 98 percent of the Group's sales are attributable to the activities conducted in Europe

<<<

 and North America. The Group has contracts with about 20 major customers on the North American market. Several of these contracts are long-term and a termination would bring both direct and indirect costs for the customer. If, despite this

<<<

, the Group were to lose one or more of these contracts, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group.

1.13

Tenders in the US
The contracts that the Group has entered into with state authorities in the US were awarded through tendering

<<<

 in public procurement processes. Tenders are awarded points based on a number of criteria such as price, customer references, technology, financial stability, size, leadership and competence. There are normally three to four procurements per

<<<

 year on the American market. There is a risk that the Group will not be successful in the procurement of new vehicle inspection programs or that the Group will not receive renewed contracts in the programs the Group currently holds. There is

<<<

 a risk that the loss of an existing program will have an adverse effect on the Group's business activities, financial position and earnings.

1.14

IT infrastructure
The Group is dependent on an effective IT infrastructure for its business

<<<

 activities. There is a risk that difficulties in maintaining and updating these systems have a negative impact on the Group's reputation among customers, and leads to increased costs and decreased profitability for the Group.

8

1.15

Relationship

<<<

 with unions
Parts of the Group's workforce are connected to, and represented by, various trade unions. However, there is a risk that conflicts might arise in the future. If such conflicts were to result in strike or lockout, there is a risk

<<<

 that this causes interruptions in the product and service offering, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business activities, earnings and financial position.

1.16

Production disruptions
There is a risk that damage to

<<<

 production facilities caused by fire, for example, and interruptions or disruptions in any stage of the production process, such as breakdowns, weather conditions, labor disputes, terrorist activities and natural disasters, have negative consequences

<<<

 in the form of direct damage to property or interruptions that hinder the ability to meet obligations to customers. There is a risk that this in turn causes customers to choose other suppliers. Such interruptions or disruptions could have a

<<<

 negative impact on the Group's business activities, earnings and financial position.

1.17

Warranty obligations to customers
The Group has warranty obligations to its customers. There is a risk that the provisions made in the ongoing management

<<<

 of such undertakings are insufficient. If this were to be the case, it could have a negative impact on the Group's earnings and financial position.

1.18

Insurance risks
There is a risk that the Group's insurance does not provide adequate

<<<

 coverage in certain circumstances and is subject to certain deductibles, exclusions, local insurance lack of capacity, no or inadequate local insurance-related estimated maximum loss reporting and limits on coverage. Furthermore, there is a

<<<

 risk that the Group is not able to maintain its insurance cover on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result of the above, there is a risk that the loss the Group has to bear the full or partial amount of losses, damages and liabilities because

<<<

 of insufficient or deficient insurance coverage. There is a risk that this in turn has a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.

9

1.19

Accreditation for vehicle inspection
Accreditation

<<<

 for vehicle inspection from Swedac is required to establish and operate vehicle inspection on the Swedish market. Similar agencies and inspection regulations exist in all markets where the Group is operating. Should the Group's subsidiaries

<<<

 not be able to comply with such regulations, and hence keep its accreditation or similar permits in the future, this could have an adverse effect on the Group's business activities, profitability and financial position.

1.20 Negative publicity

<<<


There is a risk that incidents occurring in businesses receive considerable media attention. In turn, there is a risk that such attention leads to negative publicity for the Group. There is a risk that this will have a negative impact on the

<<<

 Group's brand and reputation, which could influence the Group's chances of winning procurements and obtaining major contracts, and also affect the Group's existing customers' confidence in the Group. The risk is that this in turn will have

<<<

 a negative impact on the Group's growth, financial position and earnings.
Legal risks

1.21

Legislation and regulation
The Group's primary markets are subject to extensive regulation, for example regarding vehicle testing. There is a risk

<<<

 that the Group's business is adversely affected by changes in regulation, customs tariffs and other trade barriers, price and currency controls, and statutory regulations and restrictions in the countries in which the Group operates.

1.22

<<<



Intellectual property rights
The Group protects some of its technical innovations with patents, however all products are not protected by patents. Patent infringement and plagiarism are risks that the Group is exposed to. There is also a risk

<<<

 that the Group will not be able to retain its patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and that submitted applications for registration will not be granted. The above mentioned risks will, if materialized, have a negative

<<<

 impact on the Group's business activities, earnings and financial position.
Furthermore, there is a risk that the Group is deemed to be in infringement of intellectual property rights. Disputes concerning infringement is often costly and time

<<<

-

10

consuming and could therefore have a negative impact on the Group's operations. For more information, see the section entitled "Legal proceedings" below for information on alleged patent infringements.

1.23

Environment
Certain companies

<<<

 in the Group conduct business activities that affect the environment. If environmental requirements are tightened, this risk leading to increased costs or additional investments for the companies in the Group that are subject to such regulations

<<<

.

1.24

Legal proceedings
The Group is, besides what is reported below, not involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings that currently have, or recently have had, any material effect on the Group's financial position or profitability.

<<<

 There is, however, a risk that the Group in the future will be involved in legal proceedings, and that a negative outcome for the Group in one or more of these processes would adversely affect its business activities, earnings and financial

<<<

 position.
The Group's subsidiary Systech has been in litigation since 2007 in US courts for patent infringement concerning the Group's fuel tank tester (EVAP tester) and fuel filler cap tester. The counterparty is Hickok Inc. A negative outcome

<<<

 in the litigation will affect The Group's business activities, earnings and financial position negatively.

1.25

Tax risks
There are intra-group transactions of significant amounts within the Group which are carried out at arms-lengths principles

<<<

. There is a risk that such transactions are subject to scrutiny by individual countries tax authorities where interpretation o f laws and regulations leads to an individual tax authority not approving tax deductibility o f certain transactions

<<<

.
In general, there is a risk that mistakes are made in the Group's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, in relevant authorities' interpretation of such or in administrative practice. There is a risk that such regulations are changed

<<<

, possibly with retroactive effect.
There is a risk that a decision from a tax authority impairs the Group's previous or current tax situation, which could have a negative impact on the Group's earnings and financial position.
11

Financial

<<<

 risks

1.26

Currency exchange risks
The Group is exposed to currency exchange risks primarily through export sales (transaction risk) in Europe, the US and certain other countries, and in the conversion of net profits and net assets from foreign

<<<

 subsidiaries (translation risk). The Group's incoming net foreign exchange inflows consist primarily of US dollars and euro. The Group's main currency exposure of net assets is in US dollars. Because the Group is primarily financed in Swedish

<<<

 kronor and lends US dollars to its subsidiaries, there is a currency risk that the Group has elected to not exchange hedge. There is a risk that future fluctuations in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the Swedish krona could

<<<

 adversely affect the Group's business activities, earnings and financial position.

1.27

Interest risks
Interest risk is defined as a decrease in earnings caused by a change in market interest rates. The Group's financing sources consist primarily

<<<

 of equity, cash flow from operating activities and borrowings. The Group's current borrowings primarily have variable interest, which exposes the Group to interest rate risk. Higher market interest rates would have a negative impact on the

<<<

 Group's financial position and earnings.

1.28

Financing and liquidity risks
The Group's current and future operations are dependent on external financing. There is a risk that the Group will not be able to acquire necessary financing. There

<<<

 is a risk that additional financing will not be able to be raised on terms that are favorable for the Group's shareholders, or that such additional financing, if obtained, will not be sufficient to carry out the Group's strategy. In this respect

<<<

, general trends on the capital and credit markets are also extremely significant. If the Group were to fail to acquire sufficient financing in the future, there is a risk that the Group would be unable to continue its business activities unchanged

<<<

. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, due to insufficient liquid assets, would not be able to fully meet its payment obligations when they are due, or could only do this on very disadvantageous terms.
The Group could furthermore require

<<<

 additional financing to refinance maturing debt. Existing credit facilities and financial loans that the Group has taken out include bank loans and credit facilities. The Group has two out-standing corporate bonds in the

12

amount of MSEK

<<<

 200 and MSEK 500, which fall due on October 17, 2017 and November 20, 2018, respectively.
There is a risk that the Group in the future will fail to meet such obligations due to, for example, general economic conditions or disruptions on the

<<<

 capital and credit markets. If this were to happen, it could have an adverse effect on the Group's financial position and earnings.
There is a risk that the Group is eventually required to refinance certain or all of its outstanding debt, including

<<<

 the Bonds. The Group's ability to successfully refinance its debt is dependent on the conditions of the capital markets and its financial condition at such time. There is a risk that the Group's access to financing sources is not available

<<<

 on favorable terms, or at all. The Group's inability to refinance its debt obligations on favorable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and results of operations and on the bondholders

<<<

' recovery under the Bonds.

1.29

Credit risks and counterparty risks
Credit and counterparty risks refer to the risks that the counterparty fails to carry out the undertaking agreed upon, which could result in a loss for the Group. There is

<<<

 a risk that some of the Group's counterparties might fail to carry out the undertaking agreed upon with the Group, and this could have a negative impact on the Group's business activities, earnings and financial position.

1.30

Tangible and

<<<

 intangible assets
A significant portion of the Group's assets consist of tangible assets (buildings, land, equipment, machinery and other technical assets) and intangible assets (primarily goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets)

<<<

. The value of recognized assets is tested in regard to tangible assets and other intangible assets with definite useful lives when there are indications of write-down requirements and for other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives

<<<

 (goodwill and trademarks) at least annually in conjunction with the financial statements for the third quarter in order to identify any write-down requirements. If future impairment tests show a decrease in the value of the Group's tangible

<<<

 and intangible assets, therefore leading to write-downs, this could have an adverse effect on the Group's financial position and earnings.

13

Risks relating to the Bonds
1.31 Credit risks
An investment in the Bonds carries a credit risk

<<<

 relating to the Group. The investor's ability to receive payment under the Terms and Conditions is therefore dependent on the Group's ability to meet its payment obligations, which in turn is largely dependent on the performance of the Group

<<<

's operations and its financial position. The Group's financial position is affected by several factors, a number of which has been discussed above.
There is a risk that an increased credit risk causes the market to charge the Bonds a higher

<<<

 risk premium, which would have an adverse effect on the value o fthe Bonds. Another aspect o f the credit risk is that there is a risk that any deterioration in the financial position ofthe Group will reduce the possibility for the Group to

<<<

 receive financing and therefore affect the ability to meet interest payments or redemption o f the Bonds.
1.32 Interest rate risks
The Bonds' value depends on several factors, one of the most significant over time being the level of market

<<<

 interest rates. As the market rate of interest is largely dependent on the Swedish and international economic development and the actions of central banks, this is a risk factor which the Group cannot control. Hence, there is a risk that the

<<<

 market value o fthe Bonds is adversely affected by changes in market interest rates.
1.33 Liquidity Risk
The Group intends to apply for listing o f the Bonds on NASDAQ Stockholm. However, there is a risk that the Bonds will not be admitted

<<<

 to trading on NASDAQ Stockholm. Furthermore, even if securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, there is not always active trading in the securities. Hence, there is a risk that there will not be a liquid market for trading in

<<<

 the Bonds or that this market will not be maintained even if the Bonds are listed. Hence, there is a risk that the bondholders will be unable to sell their Bonds when desired or at a price level which allows for a profit. There is a risk that

<<<

 lack o f liquidity in the market has an adverse effect on the market value of the Bonds. Furthermore, there is a risk that the nominal value of the Bonds is not indicative o f the market price of the Bonds if the Bonds are admitted to trading

<<<

 on NASDAQ Stockholm.
14

1.34 1.35 1.36

It should also be noted that during a given time period, there is a risk that it will be difficult or impossible to sell the Bonds, at all or on reasonable terms, due to, for example, severe price fluctuations

<<<

, the relevant market being shut down or trade restrictions imposed on the market.
Currency risks
The Bonds will be denominated and payable in SEK. If bondholders in the Bonds measure their investment return by reference to a currency other

<<<

 than SEK, an investment in the Bonds will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, there is a risk that significant changes in the value of the SEK relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the

<<<

 return on their investments causes a decrease in the effective yield of the Bonds below their stated coupon rates and there is a risk that this results in a loss to investors when the return on the Bonds is translated into the currency by reference

<<<

 to which the investors measure the return on their investments. There is a risk that government and monetary authorities impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability

<<<

 of the Issuer to make payments in respect of the bonds. As a result, there is a risk that investors receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
The market value of the Bonds
There is a risk that the market

<<<

 price of the Bonds will be subject to significant fluctuations in response to actual or anticipated variations in the Group's operating results and those of its competitors, adverse business developments, changes to the regulatory environment

<<<

 in which the Group operates, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and the actual or expected sale of a large number of Bonds, as well as other factors. In addition, in recent years the global financial markets have experienced

<<<

 significant price and volume fluctuations, which, if repeated in the future, could adversely affect the market price of the Bonds without regard to the Group's operating results, financial condition or prospects.
Structural subordination and

<<<

 insolvency of subsidiaries
All assets are owned by and all revenues are generated in subsidiaries of the Group. The subsidiaries have no obligation to make payments to the parent company o f any surpluses generated from their business. The

<<<

 subsidiaries' ability to make payments is restricted by, among other things, the availability o f funds, corporate restrictions and law.

15

1.37 1.38 1.39

Furthermore, in the event of insolvency, liquidation or a similar event relating

<<<

 to any of the subsidiaries, all creditors of such subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full out of the assets of such subsidiary before the parent company, as a shareholder, would be entitled to any payments. In addition, there is a risk

<<<

 that defaults by, or the insolvency of, certain subsidiaries in the Group results in the obligation of the parent company to make payments under parent company financial or performance guarantees in respect of such subsidiaries' obligations

<<<

 or that so called cross acceleration provisions are triggered, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position and results of operations and on the bondholders' recovery under the Bonds.
Preferential rights

<<<

 of creditors - unsecured obligations
The Bonds represent an unsecured obligation of the Group. This means that in the event of the bankruptcy, reconstruction or winding-up of the Group, the holders of the Bonds normally receive payment after

<<<

 any priority creditors have been paid in full.
Each investor should be aware that there is a risk that investors in the Bonds lose all or part of their respective investment if the Group is declared bankrupt, carries out a reconstruction or

<<<

 is wound-up.
Ability to comply with the Terms and Conditions
The Group is required to comply with the Terms and Conditions, inter alia, to pay interest under the Bonds. There is a risk that events beyond the Group's control, including changes

<<<

 in the economic and business conditions in which the Group operates, affects the Group's ability to comply with, among other things, the undertakings set out in the Terms and Conditions. There is a risk that a breach of the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 results in a default under the Terms and Conditions, which could lead to an acceleration of the Bonds, resulting in that the Issuer has to repay the bondholders at the applicable call premium. In that case, there is a risk that the Issuer will

<<<

 not have sufficient funds at the time of the repayment to make the required redemption of Bonds.
Risks related to early redemption and put option
Under the Terms and Conditions, the Group has reserved the possibility to redeem all outstanding

<<<

 Bonds before the Final Redemption Date. If the Bonds are redeemed before the Final Redemption Date, the bondholders have the right to receive the Make Whole Amount or the Call Option Amount (as applicable) together with accrued but unpaid interest

<<<

. However, there is a risk that the market value of the Bonds is higher than the redemption amount and that bondholders cannot reinvest such proceeds at an effective

16

1.40 1.41

interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Bonds, and

<<<

 if they are able to do so there is a risk that they will only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate or higher risk.
According to, and as defined in, the Terms and Conditions, the Bonds are subject to prepayment at the option of each

<<<

 bondholder (put option) upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Group, a delisting of the Group or a failure to list the Bonds. There is, however, a risk that the Group does not have sufficient funds at the time of such prepayment

<<<

 to make the required prepayment of the Bonds which could adversely affect the Group, e.g., by causing insolvency or an event of default under the Terms and Conditions, and thus adversely affect all bondholders and not only those that choose

<<<

 to exercise the option.
No action against the Group and bondholders' representation
In accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the trustee will represent all bondholders in all matters relating to the Bonds and the bondholders are prevented

<<<

 from taking actions on their own against the Group. Consequently, individual bondholders do not have the right to take legal actions to declare any default by claiming any payment from the Group and there is a risk that they therefore will

<<<

 lack effective remedies unless and until a requisite majority of the bondholders agree to take such action. However, there is a risk that a bondholder, in certain situations, brings its own action against the Group (in case of breach of the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions), which could negatively impact an acceleration of the Bonds or other action against the Group. There is also a risk that to enable the trustee to represent bondholders in court, the bondholders have to submit a written

<<<

 power of attorney for legal proceedings and that the failure of all bondholders to submit such a power of attorney could negatively affect the legal proceedings.
Under the Terms and Conditions, the trustee will in some cases have the right

<<<

 to make decisions and take measures that bind all bondholders. Consequently, the actions of the trustee in such matters risks impacting a bondholder's rights under the Terms and Conditions in a manner that would be undesirable for some of the

<<<

 bondholders.
Bondholders' meeting
The Terms and Conditions will include certain provisions regarding bondholders' meeting. Such a meeting may be held in order to resolve on matters relating to the bondholders' interests. The Terms and Conditions

<<<

 will allow for stated majorities to bind all bondholders, including bondholders who have taken part in the meeting and those who have voted differently to the required majority at a duly convened and conducted bondholders' meeting. Consequently

<<<

, there is a risk that the actions of the majority in such matters impact a bondholder's rights in a manner that would be undesirable for some of the bondholders.

Restrictions on the transferability of the Bonds
The

<<<

 Bonds have not been and will not be registered in any other country than Sweden. Subject to certain exemptions, a holder of the Bonds may not offer or sell the Bonds in the United States. The Issuer has not undertaken to register the Bonds

<<<

 under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws or to affect any exchange offer for the Bonds in the future. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered the Bonds under any other country's securities laws. Hence, there is a risk

<<<

 that a bondholder cannot sell its Bonds on a foreign market.
Risks relating to clearing and settlement in Euroclear Sweden AB's book-entry system
The Bonds are affiliated to Euroclear Sweden AB's ("Euroclear") account-based system, and no physical

<<<

 notes have been, or will be, issued. Clearing and settlement relating to the Bonds is carried out within Euroclear's book-entry system, as are payment of interest and repayment of principal. Investors are therefore dependent on the functionality

<<<

 of Euroclear's account-based system for timely and accurate payment, which is a risk factor that Opus Group cannot control.
Amended or new legislation
The Terms and Conditions and this Prospectus are based on Swedish law in force on the Issue

<<<

 Date, in relation to the Terms and Conditions, and on the date hereof, in relation to this Prospectus. There is a risk that future legislative measures or changes or modifications to administrative practices affect the Group's business and

<<<

 result negatively. There is also a risk that amended or new legislation and administrative practices adversely affect the investor's ability to receive payment under the Terms and Conditions.
Potential conflict of interest
There is a risk that

<<<

 the Joint Bookrunner has engaged in, and in the future engages in, investment banking and/or commercial banking or other services for the issuer in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, there is a risk that conflicts of interest exists

<<<

 or arises as a result of the Joint Bookrunners having previously engaged, or will in the future engage, in transactions with other parties, having multiple roles or carrying out other transactions for third parties with conflicting interests

<<<

.

Information about the Company
Description of Opus Group AB (publ)
Opus Group AB (publ), (Reg. No. 556390-6063) is a Swedish public limited liability company founded in Sweden, March 9, 1990 by Magnus Greko and Jrgen Hentschel. Opus Group

<<<

's shares were admitted to trading on Nasdaq Stockholm as of July 2, 2013. In Sweden, the Company is known to the market as "Opus" or "Opus Group".
Opus Group's registered office is in Gothenburg. The Company's operations are regulated by the

<<<

 Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)). The Company's class A shares are listed on Nasdaq Stockholm.
According to Opus Group's articles of association, the object of the Company is - directly or via subsidiaries - to:
i. work

<<<

 with development, manufacturing and trade of test and measuring equipment for the vehicle industry as well as consultancy within the same industry work with development; and
ii. manufacture and sale products and services within safety and emission

<<<

 inspection of vehicles and other compatible business activities.
Business overview
Business concept
The Group operates vehicle inspection programs and develops, produces and sells equipment and IT systems for the vehicle inspection industry

<<<

. The Group is a global group of specialized companies. The Group specializes in different aspects of vehicle inspection and has strong brands in their respective segments. The Group performs approximately more than 25 million vehicle inspections

<<<

 per year around the world.
The Group is number one in the U.S. with a presence in 21 states, and number two in Sweden. The Group also operates vehicle inspection services in Mexico, Chile, Peru, Bermuda and Pakistan. The Group's customers are

<<<

 the vehicle owners visiting the Group's inspection stations as well as the authorities contracting the Group to perform inspection operations, including both IT technology and equipment.
The Group strives to be a network of local highly specialized

<<<

 companies, rather than a top-down, hierarchic organization. With a creative working environment, in which knowledge and experience exchange across country and company borders, the Group can respond faster to new opportunities. The Group believes

<<<

 that this philosophy also makes it an attractive employer.
23

Quality and customer satisfaction are essential in everything the Group does. Vehicle owners and authorities must be able to trust that the Groups inspection technicians are making

<<<

 correct, unbiased judgments every time. That is why the Group has developed their own, far-reaching quality assurance systems that detect possible deviations at an early stage. Furthermore, the Group's operations are certified in accordance

<<<

 with the quality management system ISO 9000. Opus Bilprovning AB is accredited in accordance with the quality management system ISO 17020 class A for independent accreditation bodies.
The Group works systematically to reduce energy consumption

<<<

 and to increase the share of renewable energy used. This also includes reducing the environmental impact from their transports and travel.
The Group has a program for reducing the use of chemicals and is actively choosing the alternative with

<<<

 the least environmental impact. Waste is recycled and hazardous waste is destroyed in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
Goals
Opus Group strives to have an average annual revenue growth rate (CAGR) of minimum 10 percent over a five-year

<<<

 period and an EBITDA margin of at least 15 percent.
Interest-bearing net debt in relation to earnings interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) must not exceed 3.0 times.
The annual growth rate may vary due to various factors

<<<

 such as consolidation of business activities. Sales targets are therefore based on an annual average over a five-year period ofat least 10 percent.
Opus Group has achieved an average annual sales growth of 48.6 percent from 2011 to 2015. The

<<<

 EBITDA margin in 2015 was 16.6 percent. The interest-bearing net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.4 times.
Material changes and information on trends
Material changes
Opus Group has issued the Bonds described in this Prospectus; senior unsecured

<<<

 callable bonds of SEK 500,000,000 with a term of five years. The nominal amount of each bond is SEK 1,000,000. The bond loan runs with a floating interest rate based on three months STIBOR plus the Floating Rate Margin, 4,75 per cent. per annum

<<<

, payable quarterly in arrears. STIBOR floor of zero will apply. The Final Redemption Date is 26 May 2021. Opus Group will apply for listing of the bonds at Nasdaq Stockholm.
24

In October 2015, the Swedish Transport Agency proposed that the

<<<

 current inspection interval for the inspection of passenger cars and light trucks should be changed from 3-2-1 to 4-2-2, which is the minimum EU level of inspection intervals. This proposed change would mean that most vehicles on public roads

<<<

 would go longer before receiving an initial inspection for safety or emissions and, once initially tested, the interval between all subsequent inspections would be doubled from the current interval. The Swedish Parliament has voted on the traffic

<<<

 committee's proposal in the report TU11, Vehicle and road traffic issues. The government has not yet commented on how they finally intend to proceed with the implementation of the new EU directive.
At the annual general meeting 2016 it was

<<<

 decided, in accordance with the Board's proposal, on a new issue of 5,500,000 share options that with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights, are issued to Opus Bima AB, a wholly-owned subsidiary and with the condition that the

<<<

 share options, under the proposed conditions, are to be transferred to the employees and other key members in the Group.
Furthermore, the board of directors was authorized, according to the proposal of the board, for the period until the next

<<<

 annual general meeting, take a resolution on acquisition of own shares on one or more occasions of up to 10 percent of the existing share capital. The board of directors was also authorized to take a resolution to transfer own shares that the

<<<

 company holds at the time of the transfer decision. The Board was, in accordance with the Board's proposal, authorized to decide on the issue of new shares of up to 10 percent of the existing share capital with or without deviation from the

<<<

 shareholders' preferential rights. An issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights may take place in connection with the financing of both acquisitions and expansion into new markets or new business areas that require significant

<<<

 investment.
Apart from the above, there have been no material changes in the Company's financial position or market position since the last annual report.
Trends
There has been no material adverse change in the prospects of Opus Group since

<<<

 the date of publication of its audited financial statement for 2015.
Organisational structure
Opus Group is as of the date of this prospectus the parent company of 15 directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries. Since Opus Group's operations

<<<

 are mainly carried out through its subsidiaries, Opus Group is dependent on its subsidiaries in order to generate profit and cash flow and to meet its obligations under the Terms and Conditions.
