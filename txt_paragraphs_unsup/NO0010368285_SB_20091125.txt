MEMO

To: Copy: Subject:

From: Date: November 24th 2009

In order for you as bondholders to assess the situation in better detail, we have provided you with a short company

<<<

 update. This will among other things outline the recent developments of the company. We also refer to our published second quarter report, recent press releases and notice of general meeting for further details.

Recent developments
Despite

<<<

 the two share and bond issues in late 2008 and early 2009, RXT has not been able to build up any cash buffer during 2009. Delay and cancellation of contracts previously planned in the second half of 2009 and unexpected lower profitability from

<<<

 operations have created a tight liquidity situation.
Actions are considered necessary in order for RXT to service its debt obligations, and to continue operations securing value for bondholders.
RXT has a high debt level causing high running

<<<

 interest costs. Combined with the current soft industrial market, RXT foresee to experience financial challenges related to repayment of the bond loans commencing in 2011. In an effort to improve the balance sheet and the liquidity position

<<<

 well in advance of the scheduled debt maturities due in 2011 and 2012, the Company has presented a capital restructuring proposal which is perceived to gain all stakeholders in the Company.
Plan for re-structuring
In short the following is

<<<

 proposed:
· NOKm 90.1 convertible bond o Conversion of the entire NOKm 90.1 principal plus all accrued interest into common shares at NOK 2.0 o As compensation for accepting conversion the bondholders will receive 13.5 million warrants of 

<<<

4 year duration with strike price of NOK 2.40
· NOKm 279 senior unsecured bond o Postpone maturity date beyond the revised maturity date for the NOKm 165 bonds (until June 2015) o PIK all interests until both the NOKm 400 and NOKm 165 bonds

<<<

 are fully redeemed o As compensation for accepting PIK interest the bondholders will receive 15 million warrants of 4 year duration with strike price of NOK 2.40
· NOKm 400 senior unsecured bond (each bondholder to individually decide) o Alternative

<<<

 1: defer maturity date by two years, continue to pay cash interest o Alternative 2: defer maturity date by two years, PIKall interest) until maturity date. As compensation for accepting PIK receive up to 10.4 million warrants of 4 year duration

<<<

 with strike price of NOK 2.40
· NOKm 165 senior unsecured bond (each bondholder to individually decide) o Alternative 1: defer maturity date by two years o Alternative 2: defer maturity date by two years, PIKall interest until maturity date

<<<

. As compensation for accepting PIK interest receive up to 6.495 million warrants of 4 year duration with strike price NOK 2.40

· USDm 19 convertible bond o Conversion of entire USDm 19 principal plus all accrued interest into shares at NOK

<<<

 1.30 (current conversion price) o As compensation for early conversion have a reset mechanism if equity issues are done below the conversion price for 2 years
If the proposal is approved by both bondholders and the EGM, this will improve the

<<<

 Company's liquidity position and balance sheet considerably. The interest bearing debt will be reduced by approximately NOK 200m (at USD/NOK 5.7) while the cash interest savings will be approximately NOK 124m (NOK 26.5m + NOK 97.8m from conversions

<<<

 and PIK's respectively), assuming no bondholders in NOKm 400 and NOKm 165 bonds choose the PIK and warrant alternative . The revised maturity date proposed will better match the company's cash flow forecasts with the company's debt obligations

<<<

.
The proposed debts for equity conversions of the bonds and issuance of warrants in i. above require the approval of the Extraordinary General Meeting (the "EGM"). The company has called for an EGM to be held on the 7. December 2009. RXT has

<<<

 received pre commitments in favour of the proposal from shareholders, holding in total 44% of the outstanding votes.
Status current operations
Status for each operation: · RXT1: M/V Beulah Chouest remains stacked in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM

<<<

), and the equipment is warehoused.
· RXT2: Production in Nigeria was behind production targets in Q3 2009. This is a legacy issue and was mainly due to lack of spares causing higher technical downtime. The spares situation has now improved

<<<

, and production has increased in Q4 2009. Sanco Spirit was delivered from the yard in Norway in the end of October 2009. The vessel is rigged as a source vessel, and will replace Ocean Pearl which is due for drydock later this year.
· RXT3

<<<

: The seismic equipment has been stored onshore in the Caspian region. Demobilisation resulted in some expenses in Q3 2009.
· RXT4: The program in the UK sector in the North Sea was completed in mid July 2009, and the vessel - Vikland - acquired

<<<

 thereafter a short test program for an oil company in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. A four week program, also in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, was completed in mid September 2009. The Vessel is now on its way to Brazil, to

<<<

 complement the RXT5 operation.
· RXT5: Production, while on target overall for the year, was low in Q3 2009. Cable handling has been very slow in the deep water part of the current program as expected. It is anticipated that acquisition in

<<<

 deep water will continue for another month. The vessels will then move to shallower water, and a significant improvement in the productivity is expected. We also expect a positive contribution from Vikland when the vessel arrives in Brazil

<<<

.
Our main focus is to secure new contracts for our operations, reduce cost, and improve operational efficiency.
RXT has currently two crews in operation, RXT2 and RXT5. RXT4 - Vikland - will be taken to Brazil to complement the RXT5 operation

<<<

, to increase productivity and revenue.
RXT is bidding on several contracts, and it is expected that the first ones will be awarded in Q4 2009. RXT has equipment strategically warehoused in the Caspian Region and the US Gulf of Mexico for the

<<<

 possibility should market and financial conditions allow operations, to restart in these areas. RXT has seismic equipment to run five operations.
There is still a strong focus on cost control to adjust to our current and planned activity. If

<<<

 the bond restructuring is completed, RXT expects to be slightly cash positive with the income from the two existing contracts in Nigeria and Brazil.
The value of our outstanding tenders increased from $450 million to $1,100 million from end

<<<

 Q2 2009 to end Q3 2009. The value is currently $1,200 million.

Bidding activity has never been higher, and we believe that this will result in higher activity for our operations in 2010.
Financials
In the following we will present you with

<<<

 the YTD 30 September 2009 status of our financials, as well as an overview over our asset base and our liabilities;
RXT has had a strategy of investing in seismic equipment and take in vessels on charter as opposed to take this on our balance

<<<

 sheet. The philosophy behind this has been to scale the business after the activity level, as well as limiting the investments needed for operations. Our total assets 30 September 2009 amounted to USD 268.2 million, of which USD 173.8 million

<<<

 was related to investments in seismic equipment. Our cash balance at 30 September 2009 was USD 7.9 million, while the accounts receivables amounted to USD 39.5 million.

Deferred tax asset The company has tax reducing differences of USD 25.5 million in net losses and tax credits carried forward. In addition, the company has

<<<

 substantial tax reducing temporary differences related to seismic equipment amounting to approximately USD 32 million. Total net temporary differences at 31 December 2008 amounted to 64.5 million (net tax reducing differences). The deferred

 2008, and January 2009. Please note that the company wrote down USD 2.4 million in Q4 2008 related to multi client seismic shot in the North Sea in 2007.
Other intangible assets The carrying value of USD 6.8 million is capitalized development

<<<

 costs related to the development of EM-technology.
Seismic equipment The total carrying amount of USD 173.8 million consists of seismic equipment related to the 5 crews (RXT1-RXT5) RXT had in operation at 30 September 2009 and capitalized rigging

<<<

 costs. It should be noted that RXT1 has been shut down in the beginning of 2009 and that RXT3 completed the CKNG contract at the end of May 2009 and has not secured any further work. The equipment related to RXT1 and RXT3 will be used in the

<<<

 other three operations until further work is secured for RXT1 and RXT3. RXT4 has been operating in Q1 and Q2 2009, and parts of Q3 2009.
Investment in equity accounted investees Reservoir Exploration Technology ASA (RXT) acquired 50 % of the

<<<

 shares in KMS (KJT Enterprises Inc.) in December 2007. Through this ownership RXT has secured exclusive rights to the KMS technology for cable based seafloor applications. The total purchase price was USD 17.4 million. At 31 December 2008,

<<<

 the carrying amount of the investment was written down to USD 6 million due to the current financial situation and uncertainty related to the timeline of the development of cable based seafloor EM-technology and the eventual commercialization

<<<

 of the product. A preference share issue towards employees of KMS was carried out in March 2009 which reduced the RXT ASA ownership percentage down to 40 %.
Accounts receivable Accounts receivable consists of receivables from the current clients

<<<

 ExxonMobil and Petrobras.
Other current assets The USD 20.1 million consists of fuel inventory, prepaid expenses, deferred steaming expenses and deferred mobilization expenses. A majority of these costs are deferred mobilization expenses, which

<<<

 will be expensed over the follow-on survey after mobilization. The corresponding mobilization fee from the client is treated in the same way.

Rationale behind proposal put forward to bondholders
Due to the decline in the market activity, the stacked crews and the high running

<<<

 interest costs, RXT is expected to struggle to honour the payback of the outstanding bonds commencing in 2011. The proposal to the bondholders will improve the company's credit profile significantly and give the company a required liquidity

<<<

 improvement, better matching expected cash flows from operations with its debt service obligations as they fall due. The debt level of RXT is viewed as too high compared to the market and the company's financial performance.
RXT is suggesting

<<<

 the proposed changes to the capital structure at an early stage as it appears unrealistic for the company to be able to repay the outstanding bonds maturing in 2011 given the current cash flow expectations. It is the Board of Directors opinion

<<<

 that measures needs to be taken in order for the company to be able to honor its future liabilities. The proposed actions are believed to be a fair and balanced solution for the involved stakeholders.
