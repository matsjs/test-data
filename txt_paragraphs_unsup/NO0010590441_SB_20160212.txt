Oslo, 12 February 2016
Summons to Bondholders' Meetings
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issues (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issues") issued by Havila

<<<

 Shipping ASA as issuer (the "Company" or the "Issuer").
Capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreements dated 5 November 2010 for HAVI04, 28 March 2011 for HAVI06/07 and 27 August 2012 for HAVI0

<<<

8 (the "Bond Agreements" and each a "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer, the market conditions and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly

<<<

 disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 BACKGROUND
Reference is made to the press release issued by the Company on 5 January 2016. Therein, the Company outlined the restructuring agreement with its bank lenders (the

<<<

 "Master Agreement") setting out the main terms and conditions of a financial restructuring of the Issuer's group. On the same date, the Company summoned bondholders' meetings in the Bond Issues to approve the restructuring, and certain amendments

<<<

 to the terms of the Bond Issues.
Following the announced restructuring, the Company has been in extensive dialogue with Bondholders in each o f the three Bond Issues, which have contributed with constructive and specific suggestions for a revised

<<<

 proposal acceptable to their respective bondholder community. In addition, the Company has facilitated cross-creditor dialogue in order to increase transparency and understanding for all major creditor groups.
The Company's financial position

<<<

 remains highly challenging, and it is imperative for continued operations that the financial restructuring is concluded. In light of this and on the basis of discussions to date, the Company hereby presents a revised restructuring proposal

<<<

 (the "Restructuring"). The revised proposal is based on the dialogue with the stakeholders, and although not pre-agreed with qualified majorities across all Bond Issues, it is supported by the largest holders within all Bond Issues, as well

<<<

 as

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlts gate 1. Oslo

nordictrustee.com

the bank lenders, which have agreed to a revised Master Agreement, and Havila Holding AS as the largest shareholder and guarantor for the equity issue.
The revised

<<<

 Restructuring proposal versus the original proposal consists of the following main elements (for description of the original proposal, please refer to the summons letter o f 5 January 2016):
· NOK 4.5 million of the interest on HAVI08 for each

<<<

 o f the years 2016-2018 shall be paid in cash.
· The Company will offer to buy back bonds in HAVI08 (the "Bond Buy-Back") up to a total nominal value of NOK 275 million at a price of up to 30% of par value with settlement in cash upon completion

<<<

 of the Restructuring. The Bond Buy-Back will be carried out as a reverse auction, in which the sales price is equal for all sales and will be determined on the basis of sales orders received. If the total volume tendered exceeds NOK 275 million

<<<

 in par value, allocation will be made such that any volume tendered below the sales price is fully repurchased and any volume tendered at the sales price is bought back pro rata based on the amount of Bonds offered (always subject to the total

<<<

 volume bought not exceeding NOK 275 million in par value).
· The equity issue will be increased from minimum NOK 200 million to NOK 300 million to enable cash interest payment on HAVI08 and to facilitate the Bond Buy-Back as described above

<<<

.
· The Sasvik family intends to maintain its current proportionate shareholding and Havila Holding AS has guaranteed a subscription of NOK 153 million.
· The new equity is to be secured through a private placement directed towards existing

<<<

 shareholders and new investors, subject to and in accordance with applicable securities regulations. Bondholders wanting to participate in the equity issue will be given preferred allocation before new investors to the extent possible.
There

<<<

 are no material amendments to the proposal to holders of HAVI04 and HAVI06/07.
The Master Agreement, as revised to reflect the updated Restructuring proposal, remains subject to the following main conditions to be subsequently satisfied:
·

<<<

 Approval by Bondholders of corresponding amendments to the Company's Bond Agreements as set forth herein no later than 15 February 2016.
· New equity secured no later than 15 March 2016, and · Completed renegotiation of payment of the bareboat

<<<

 charter hire for "Havila Troll" no later than
15 February 2016.
The Company has on back of a constructive dialogue with the largest Bondholders requested the parties to the Master Agreement for an extension of the deadline with respect to approval

<<<

 from Bondholders to reflect the new date for the Bondholders' Meetings (26 February 2016). Although the request has been approved by a vast majority of the parties, 100% approval was unfortunately not obtained which is a requirement for amendments

<<<

 to the Master Agreement to become effective.
In light o f the above and in order to comply with the requirements as stipulated in the Master Agreement, the Company is required to have a qualifying majority in the Bond Issues by 15 February

<<<

 2016.
It is clear that the conditions set out herein continue to reflect the extremely challenging conditions now facing the Company and all its stakeholders, which has further deteriorated since the signing of the Master Agreement. Should

<<<

 the Company fail to receive the necessary pre-acceptances from Bondholders by 15 February, the Master Agreement will expire. In such case, the board and management of the Company are forced to evaluate the Company's options, including the viability

<<<

 of further negotiations with its creditors.
Negotiations regarding the amendment of the bareboat charter hire for "Havila Troll" are ongoing and is required to be concluded within 15 February 2016.
