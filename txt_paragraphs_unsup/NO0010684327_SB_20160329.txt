 Bond Issue 2013/2018
Oslo, 29 March 2016 SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING REGARDING REQUEST FOR A TEMPORARY WAIVER OF. INTER ALTA. THU INTEREST COUPON PAYMENT AND THE PRINCIPAL AMORTISATION INSTALMENT DUE 5 APRIL 2016
Nordic Trustee ASA (the

<<<

 "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the "7.5 per cent BassDrill Alpha Ltd. Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2018" - ISIN: NO 001068432.7 (the "Bond Issue"), issued by BassDrill Alpha Ltd, Bermuda

<<<

 (the "Issuer"). All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the bond loan agreement for the Bond Issue dated 3 July 2013 (the "Bond Agreement"). The

<<<

 information in this Summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information. 1. BACKGROUND AND CORPORATE UPDATE 1.1 Operational

<<<

 Update
The only asset of the Issuer, the tender drilling barge named BassDrill Alpha (the "Barge"), is currently warm-stacked in Congo following Total's early termination of the contract in May 2015. The Barge has been actively marketed by

<<<

 its manager Atlantica Management Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlantica Tender Drilling, and until early 2016 a possible term drilling contract was being negotiated, but negotiations were postponed as oil prices continued to drop. Due

<<<

 to the prevailing adverse market conditions with no earnings and a continuous challenging market for the Barge, the Issuer will soon no longer be able to honour certain terms and conditions under the Bond Agreement.

1.2 Financial

<<<

 Update
As at the end of February 2016, the Issuer had a cash holding of USD 9,639,940, of which USD 6,888,749 is restricted cash. The cost of having the Barge laid up in Congo is approximately USD 500,000 per month, and with the current cash

<<<

 position, it is likely that the Issuer will default under the Bond Agreement by May 2016. Furthermore, the current severe oil & offshore market may negatively affect the Market Value of the Barge which is due for new valuations which consequently

<<<

 may put the Asset Cover Ratio required under the Bond Agreement at risk. In June 2015, the shareholders refrained from distributing USD 5,000,000 of previously permitted dividends from the Issuer, and instead allowed the Issuer to apply these

<<<

 funds to repurchase bonds and pay lay-up costs. Without any further debt service, the current cash position of the Issuer, including the restricted cash, will enable the Issuer to keep the Barge laid-up until October 2017. In view of the foregoing

<<<

, the Issuer has begun discussions with its shareholders, and an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders holding more than 58% of the outstanding Bonds (the "Committee"), regarding a potential restructuring of the Issuer's capital structure

<<<

. The Committee has already instructed the Bond Trustee to retain Akin Gump LLP and Advokatfirmaet Thommessen AS as its legal advisers. In particular, the Issuer has proposed to the Committee to defer the payment of interest and principal on

<<<

 the Bonds falling due for payment on 5 April 2016 (the "April Payments") whilst discussions are ongoing. In addition, the Issuer has proposed that no further transfers to the Retention Account shall be made, and no Market Value shall be provided

<<<

, and that the Asset Cover Ratio requirement under the Bond Agreement shall be disapplied for the same period. The Committee has indicated its support for the requested waivers subject to certain conditions, as more particularly described in

<<<

 the Proposal (as defined below) below. The Committee is aware that the Issuer, regardless of the temporaiy non-payment of the April Payments shall continue to pay its suppliers and all operational expenses relating to the Barge.
The Issuer

<<<

 has informed the Bond Trustee that as at the date of this Summons, the Issuer has already received legally binding undertakings from Bondholders holding in excess of 58% of the Voting Bonds to vote in favour of the Proposal at the Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting.
2. TEMPORARY WAIVER
