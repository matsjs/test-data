 Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 with Warrants

Oslo, 18 April 2008
Request for a waiver of covenants - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned Bond

<<<

 issue where Biofuel Energy ASA is the borrower (the "Borrower").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement for the above mentioned Bond Issue (the "Loan Agreement"), or in this summons.

<<<


We refer to:
a. the Loan Agreement, among the Borrower, the Bondholders from time to time party thereto, and the Loan Trustee;
b. the requirement under clause 10.4 of the Loan Agreement that the Borrower make an offer to each Bondholder to

<<<

 purchase the Bonds held by such Bondholder at 105% of par value (plus accrued interest) within the Change of Control Redemption Period following notification of a Change of Control Event (the "Change of Control Requirement"); and
c. the requirements

<<<

 under clause 14.1(ii) & 14.2(h) of the Loan Agreement that each Warrantholder shall have the same subscription right as the shareholders of the Borrower as if such Warrantholder had already exercised its Exercise Rights where the Borrower offers

<<<

 Shares or financial instruments, respectively, to its shareholders (the "Anti-Dilution Requirements").
d. a presentation of the Borrower available at www.stamdata.no with further details on the financial situation of the Project and the Borrower

I.

Background

The Borrower has informed the Loan Trustee that:

1. The Borrower will likely incur substantial overruns on the forecasted capital expenditures to complete the Project and estimates that it will require an additional

NOK 350,000,000 to fund

<<<

 the remaining payment obligations arising under the EPC Contract (as defined in the Loan Agreement) through June of 2008 (the "Funding Requirement").
The Borrower intends to raise this additional funding primarily through an equity subscription

<<<

 offering and an offering of a participation in a bridge loan to the Project Company together with warrants (the "Offerings") that will close on 25 April 2008 and 29 April 2008, respectively (the period between the date 11 April 2008 and 29

<<<

 April 2008 being the "Offering Period").
Umoe Invest AS ("Umoe"), the Borrower's largest shareholder, has expressed a willingness to participate in the share offering up to the full amount of the Funding Requirement in the event that the Company

<<<

 cannot raise sufficient funds from other shareholders during the Offering Period. The definition of Change of Control Event and the Change of Control Requirement, however, effectively prohibit UMOE from participating on this basis because its

<<<

 post-money shareholding in the Borrower would increase up to 66 % --significantly above the 50% ownership level permitted under the definition of Change of Control Event - which would then trigger the Borrower's obligation to offer to purchase

<<<

 the Bonds in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement, defeating the purpose for which UMOE made this additional investment.
The Borrower has informed the Loan Trustee that the Offerings do not fully comply with the Anti-Dilution Requirements

<<<

 as the Borrower made the Offerings available only to its shareholders, but not the Warrantholders, during the Offering Period. By letter from the Borrower to Loan Trustee of even date hereof, the Borrower has undertaken to repair this situation

<<<

 by launching an offer to the Warrantholders for their prorata portion of the Shares and warrants forming part of the Offerings as contemplated by the Anti-Dilution Requirements no later than 45 calendar days after the date hereof.
The Project

<<<

 Company recently informed the Borrower that (i) its license for the operation of the existing distillery (the "Unit 1 Operating License") has expired before the date of signing of the Loan Agreement and the date of disbursement of the Loan

<<<

, (ii) it will apply for a new Unit 1 Operating License once the Project Company obtains a preliminary license and a construction license for Unit 1, (iii) while it has obtained a preliminary license to commence construction of the second distillery

<<<

 ("Unit 2"), the license does not conform to the proposed crushing capacity, (iv) it has applied for a construction license, which covers the proposed crushing capacity of Unit 2, and will apply for an operating license for Unit 2 (the "Unit

<<<

 2 Operating License") once the licensing authorities have issued such construction license, and (v) the project currently complies with all environmental benchmarks and best practices required by the licensing authorities.
Each of the directors

<<<

 of the board of the Borrower have represented and warranted, to the best of his or her knowledge, that all licenses required for each Obligor, which includes the Project Company, to carry out its business as then conducted as well as perform

<<<

 the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents, had been obtained and were in full force and effect as of the date on which such representations and warranties were made. These representations and warranties were materially incorrect

<<<

 at the time made or deemed to be made due to the absence of each of the licenses referenced in Clause 4 above (collectively, the "Licenses"). The failure of the Project

N O RSK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
Company to obtain the Licenses could have

<<<

 had, and could still have, a material adverse effect on the Project Company's ability to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents, because the Project Company could be fined by the governmental authorities in Brazil and/or the existing

<<<

 refinery could be shut down by the governmental authorities in Brazil at any time.
Nevertheless, the failure of the Project Company to obtain the Licenses appears to be an industry-wide problem in Brazil. Many sugar refiners, in addition to

<<<

 the Project Company, have been and are operating without benefit of appropriate licenses as the governmental authorities have been unable to cope with the significant expansion of the sugar refining business in Brazil.
Waiver Solicitation
Borrower

<<<

 hereby solicits the consent of the Bondholders to:
waive the Change of Control Requirement with respect to UMOE's ownership interest in the Borrower, but only on the condition that: (i) the Borrower raise at least NOK 250,000,000 of additional

<<<

 equity as part of the Offering by the close of the Offering Period, and (ii) UMOE's ownership interest in the Borrower never exceeds 75 % of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Borrower after the consummation of such offer;
waive

<<<

 any Event of Default that may arise out of the Borrower's delayed compliance with the Anti-Dilution Requirements; and
waive all Events of Default arising out the Project Company's failure to obtain the Licenses as of the date hereof (other

<<<

 than any Event of Default arising out of a payment default by the Borrower or clauses 18.1(c) or (d) of the Loan Agreement, relating to certain cross-defaults) but only on the conditon that:
1. the Borrower causes the Project Company to (i

<<<

) exercise its best efforts to obtain the preliminary license for Unit 1 no later than 31 July 2008, and (ii) exercise its best efforts to obtain the Unit 1 Operating License and Unit 2 Operating License (collectively, the "Operating Licenses

<<<

") no later than 1 October 2008; provided, however, that if, notwithstanding its best efforts, the Project Company fails to obtain such Licenses prior to the foregoing deadlines, then the Borrower shall ensure that the Project Company shall

<<<

 exercise its best efforts to obtain the Operating Licenses as promptly as possible thereafter provided further that the Project Company shall have an absolute and unconditional obligation to procure the Operating Licences no later than 1 December

<<<

 2009; and
2. in the event that the Project Company fails to obtain the Operating Licences by 1 October 2008, by 1 November 2008 or by 1 December 2008, respectively (each a Relevant Date), the Borrower shall pay to the Bondholders for each Relevant

<<<

 Date passed without Operating Licences a fee of 0.5% of the principal amount of the Loan.

N O R SK TIL L IT SM A N N ASA

Except for any material breach of the Borrower's obligations arising under this Section II (c), Borrower's failure to

<<<

 meet any of the foregoing deadlines or otherwise obtain the Licences shall neither constitute an Event of Default, or give the Bondholders the right to declare the Loan in default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower acknowledges and

<<<

 agrees that the Project Company's failure to obtain the Operating Licences by 1 December 2009 shall constitute an Event of Default.

Except as expressly provided in this Waiver, the Loan Agreement and all provisions thereof in effect as of

<<<

 the date hereof shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed. Except as expressly provided herein, the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Waiver shall not operate as a waiver or an amendment of any

<<<

 condition precedent, misrepresentation, breach, Event of Default, right, power or remedy of any party to the Loan Agreement or constitute a waiver or an amendment of any provision thereof. The granting of the waiver does not establish a course

<<<

 of dealing or otherwise obligate the Loan Trustee or any Bondholders or Warrantholders at any Bondholders' meeting to agree to any waiver or amendment in the future.

To enable the Borrower to conduct the proposed change

<<<

 of the Bond Agreement, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes.

The Loan Trustee points out that the Borrower technically is in Default based on the lack

<<<

 of Licences and the representations given concerning the Licences. According to the information presented by the Borrower there is an urgent cash requirement for the Project to continue. The expansion of the existing distillery and the construction

<<<

 of the second distillery constitutes the only projects within the Borrower, and the Project is therefore crucial to the financial future of the Borrower. This emphasises the importance and urgency receiving the waivers to successfully raising

<<<

 the equity / funding. In the Loan Trustee's opinion, the Borrower may benefit from getting Umoe as a dedicated industrial owner which could have a positive effect on the Project going forward.

The request is put forward to the Bondholders

<<<

 without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' meeting

In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee

<<<

 accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by

<<<
