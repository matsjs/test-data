5.3 Voting rights and authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on 12 January 2018 (the "Record Date") in the debt register:
(a) be registered as a direct registered

<<<

 owner of one or several Notes on a Securities Account; or
(b) be registered as an authorised nominee on a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Notes.
5.4 Notes registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered

<<<

 owner, but your Notes are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Notes.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds

<<<

 the Notes on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you

<<<

 hold your Notes through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as noteholder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of noteholders

<<<

, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a Noteholder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement

<<<

 between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds

<<<

 the Notes on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Notes are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate. Notes owned by the Issuer, another Group Company

<<<

 or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights.
5.5 Quorum
To approve the Proposal, Noteholders representing at least twenty (20) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the request under the Written Procedure in order to

<<<

 form a quorum.
If a quorum does not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure.
