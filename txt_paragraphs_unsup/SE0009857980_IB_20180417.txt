To the Bondholders in:
ISIN: SE0009857980 - Bewi Group AB (publ) (the "Issuer") up to SEK 750,000,000 senior secured floating rate bonds (the "Existing Bonds")

Stockholm, 17 April 2018

Notice of amendment and restatement of the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement
Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) is the appointed trustee (the "Trustee") under the terms and conditions for the Existing Bonds (the "Terms and Conditions"). The Trustee and, amongst others, the Issuer entered into an intercreditor

<<<

 agreement on 5 June 2017 (the "Intercreditor Agreement") regulating, among other things, the ranking and priority between the Super Senior Debt and the Senior Debt and the manner of enforcement of the Transaction Security (each as defined in

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement).
This notice is distributed to the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 20 (c) of the Terms and Conditions.
All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this Notice shall have the meanings assigned

<<<

 thereto in the Terms and Conditions and the Intercreditor Agreement and any reference in this Notice to a Clause shall be a reference to such Clause in the Intercreditor Agreement.
At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee has agreed to amend

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with Clause 20(a)(i) (Amendments and Waivers) of the Terms and Conditions.
The Issuer will, in accordance with the Senior Finance Documents, issue up to an initial aggregate amount of EUR 75,000,00

<<<

0 senior secured floating rate bonds and may issue subsequent bonds of up to an aggregate amount of EUR 25,000,000 (the "New Bonds"). The New Bonds falls under paragraph (g) of the definition of "Permitted Debt" in the Terms and Conditions and

<<<

 require that the Issuer meets the Incurrence Test.
The existing voting provisions for decision making in connection with enforcement actions under the Intercreditor Agreement entails that those Senior Creditors whose Senior Debt (i.e. the Existing

<<<

 Bonds and the New Bonds) at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the total Senior Debt at that time have the instructing right in an enforcement scenario. Since the issuance of the New Bonds is larger than the Existing Bonds, the bondholders

<<<

 under the New Bonds would have the instructing right in connection with enforcement pursuant to the existing voting provisions.
In order for the Bondholders under the Existing Bonds to maintain a larger degree of control in connection with

<<<

 an enforcement scenario following the issuance of the New Bonds, the Intercreditor Agreement will be amended so that, for as long as the indebtedness under the New Bonds is of a higher total amount than the Existing Bonds, the instructing party

<<<

 in connection with enforcement under the Intercreditor Agreement will be the representative of those of the bondholders under the New Bonds and the Bondholders under the Existing Bonds, voting for the relevant decision, whose Senior Debt at

<<<

 that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the total Senior Debt at that time, calculated based on the

bondholders under the New Bonds and the Bondholders under the Existing Bonds voting as one creditor class with a representative of the

<<<

 majority of such creditor class being the senior representative. If the indebtedness under the New Bonds is less than the indebtedness under the Existing Bonds, the instructing party in connection with enforcement will be the same as under

<<<

 the existing Intercreditor Agreement, i.e. the representative of those Senior Creditors whose Senior Debt at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the total Senior Debt at that time.
Further, pursuant to Danish law, the Security Agent

<<<

 is required to be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with Clause 18.1(e) in the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the issuance of the New Bonds, the Security Agent needs to be registered as Security

<<<

 Agent also in respect of the New Bonds. After 5 June 2017, which is the date when the Intercreditor Agreement was originally entered into, Danish law has been amended in relation to the requirement to register the Security Agent with the Danish

<<<

 Financial Supervisory Authority. In order to have the Security Agent registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority the Intercreditor Agreement should include provisions regulating a general right to request the replacement of the

<<<

 Security Agent and a requirement for the Security Agent to resign in the event of insolvency. In order to facilitate the Danish registration of the Security Agent, Clause 24.6 (Resignation o f Agents) of the Intercreditor Agreement will be

<<<

 amended.
Finally, in accordance with Clause 17.2 (Release and granting o f security upon disposals) of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Group has on 10 April 2018 disposed of the shares in Genevad Vårgårda Holding AB and Vårgårda Genevad Fastighet

<<<

 AB (the "Disposed Companies") (the "Disposal") (which shares prior to the Disposal was granted as Transaction Security in favor of the Secured Parties) to a third party. In connection with the Disposal, the Security Agent released the Transaction

<<<

 Security over the Disposed Companies and the Guarantees provided by the Disposed Companies in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Further, in connection with the Disposal, Genevad Holding AB granted Transaction Security

<<<

 over a bank account, into which the cash purchase price (less transaction costs) for the Disposed Companies was transferred to, on terms similar to the terms of the other Security Documents. The Disposal and the release of the Transaction Security

<<<

 and the Guarantees was made in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. In order to reflect the Disposal, the Intercreditor Agreement will be amended in order to remove the references to the Disposed Companies.

 and the Trustee have deemed that the proposed amendments are not detrimental to the interests of the Existing Bondholders as a group, the Issuer and the Trustee agree to the amendments set out in the table below.
