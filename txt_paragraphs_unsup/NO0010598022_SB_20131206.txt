 to the Issuer is subject to a condition that Alrai obtains financing for the Convertible Loan on for Alrai acceptable terms and conditions.

The Issuer has issued warrants with ISIN N00010598089. The Issuer intends to use the proceeds of these

<<<

 warrants to repay the Bonds. The Issuer wants to provide holders of the warrants a possibility to appropriately evaluate the financial standing of the Issuer before they need to decide whether to exercise the warrants. As the final date for

<<<

 submitting notice of exercise of warrants is 12 December 2013 (with maturity date 30 December 2013) and the Issuer may experience that the condition for disbursement of the Convertible Loan cannot be fulfilled prior to this date, it is proposed

 to approve a postponement of the Final Maturity Date of the Bond. A postponement of the Final Maturity Date of the Bond Issue will thus help facilitate the repayment of the Bonds.

Against the above background, the Issuer requests the Bondholders

' Meeting to approve the following proposal (the "Proposal"):

(a)

the Final Maturity Date of the Bond Issue is postponed until the earlier of:

(i) The date falling 5 Business Days after the proceeds of the Convertible Loan have been made
