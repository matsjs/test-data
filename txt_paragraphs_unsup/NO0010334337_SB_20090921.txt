2 THE PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING The financial restructuring (the "Restructuring") is proposed to be carried out as follows:
A) Amendments to bank loan agreements:

<<<

 The Borrower and its subsidiary Eitzen Chemical (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. ("Eitzen Singapore") is in the process of negotiating amendments to the three loan agreements entered into between Eitzen Singapore and three different bank syndicates (the

<<<

 "Syndicate Lenders"). Pursuant to these amendments, among other changes, instalments are deferred, certain covenants are amended and maturities potentially extended. The Borrower has proposed to the Syndicate Lenders that all scheduled debt

<<<

 amortisation (i.e. debt amortisation that is not made as a consequence of the disposal of assets) in the period from Q3 2009 to Q4 2012 shall be postponed and be payable in a balloon repayment due 6 November 2012 (including) (the "Moratory

<<<

 Expiry Date") at the earliest, however, with potential variable debt amortisation if the Borrower's cash position exceeds certain minimum thresholds. The minimum thresholds will be set at a level which secure adequate headroom for the Borrower

<<<

 in the sole opinion of the Borrower.
B) Amendments to bond loan agreement: The Borrower proposes to amend the Loan as further set out in the Proposal set out below.
C) Equity issue: The Borrower shall complete an equity issue directed towards

<<<

 new investors and existing shareholders of the Company in an amount to be announced at or prior to the Bondholders' meeting (the "Equity Issue"). It is anticipated that the Equity Issue will be completed by way of a private placement of new

<<<

 shares. It is also anticipated that the Borrower will propose to conduct a subsequent offering towards existing shareholders of the Company that were not offered or invited to participate in the Equity Issue, subject to certain selling restrictions

<<<

.
The amendments to the bank loan agreements and the bond loan agreement will be conditional upon completion of the Equity Issue.
As mentioned above, the Company will at or prior to the Bondholders' meeting provide information about the planned

<<<

 size of the Equity Issue. The Bondholders are invited to participate in an information meeting (the "Information Meeting") on 24 September 2009 at 17:30 hours (Oslo time) in the premises of Norsk Tillitsmann, Haakon VII's gate 1, Oslo (Norway

6 EVALUATION OF THE

<<<

 PROPOSAL 6.1 The Company's evaluation The Company has previously communicated that it is in the need of a financial restructuring and that it is dependent on successful execution of a financial restructuring in order to meet its commitments

<<<

. The current cash generation is not sufficient to meet the current debt amortisation schedule and short term liquidity is limited. The main objective with the planned Restructuring is to safeguard values into market recovery and secure a robust

<<<

 business plan. Although the Company acknowledges that significant concessions are required from all stakeholders, the Restructuring represents in the Company's view a balanced proposal. The Restructuring will increase headroom and is expected

<<<

 to safeguard values for the Bondholders in the current challenging chemical tanker market. The Borrower and the financial advisors are of the opinion that the proposed amendments to the bank loan agreements and the Loan Agreement are required

<<<

 to facilitate the Equity Issue in the Company, which will be to the benefit of the Bondholders. Correspondingly, the Company is of the opinion that the Proposal is to the advantage of the Bondholders, and that the Proposal is fully aligned

<<<

 with the interests of the Bondholders. 6.2 The Trustee's evaluation The Trustee is not in a position to make any recommendation with regard to the proposed Restructuring, and the proposed Restructuring is therefore put forward without any further

<<<

 evaluations or recommendation from the Trustee. The Trustee put forward the Proposal without any further evaluations or recommendation from the Trustee. Further information about the Restructuring will be given at the Information Meeting. The

<<<

 Bondholders must independently evaluate, based on available information, whether the Proposal is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences of

<<<

 the Proposal.

OVERVIEW OF EITZEN CHEMICAL

Eitzen Chemical is a leading chemical transportation company with a total sailing fleet of 84 vessels. The fleet

<<<

 consists of coated and stainless steel vessels ranging from 3,500 to 48,000 dwt, primarily designed for the transport of IMO II classified chemical cargoes.

The current fleet comprise 63 vessels, of which 56 vessels are owned or on financial

<<<

 lease and seven vessels are on operational lease. In addition, the Company operates 21 vessels for partners through commercial management agreements. The average age of the owned and leased vessels is less than seven years and Eitzen Chemical

<<<

 operates one of the most modern chemical fleets globally. The vessels are commercially operated through offices in Denmark, France, Spain, USA and Singapore.

Eitzen Chemical transports a wide variety of cargoes such as organic chemicals, non

<<<

-organic chemicals, clean and dirty petroleum products, and vegetable oils and lube oils.

The vessels below 30,000 dwt are mainly involved in regional trades. The vessels above 30,000 dwt operate in global trades. The vessels are employed in

<<<

 the spot market or chartered out through time charter agreements or contracts of affreightment.

RECENT EVENTS AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

In the interim financial report for the second quarter of 2009, Eitzen Chemical announced that the

<<<

 Company is in process of developing a long term financial plan and that a financial restructuring is required. It was announced that the financial plan would include a proposal for a new debt repayment schedule and covenant structure as well

<<<

 as a new equity issue to strengthen the balance sheet and cash position. The cash position at the end of Q2 2009 was below the short term target and the Company announced that it is dependent on a successful execution of the financial plan

<<<

 in order to meet its commitments. Further reference is made to the Company's interim financial report for the second quarter of 2009 for a detailed financial review.

Eitzen Chemical has recently completed a number of stabilising actions to

<<<

 reduce debt and improve operational efficiency. In April, the Company cancelled the remaining newbuilding program of eight vessels and thereby eliminated capital expenditure commitments related to newbuildings. Furthermore, Eitzen Chemical

<<<

 has sold 11 vessels year to date. Proceeds from these vessel sales amount to approximately USD 82 million, of which about USD 65 million have been used to reduce interest bearing debt as a consequence of mandatory prepayments under the relevant

<<<

 secured credit facility agreements. Despite newbuilding cancellations and asset sales, Eitzen Chemical continues to have a strong market position and is well positioned to regain earnings momentum when the market recovers. The Company continuously

<<<

 focus on efficient management of its fleet and have also managed to reduce operating expenses.
