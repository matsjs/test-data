OTC announcement
Skeie Drilling & Production ASA - Increased capex and proposed fix
April 17th, 2009
Skeie Drilling & Production is currently constructing

<<<

 3 large N-Class Jack-Up offshore drilling rigs suited for operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf at Keppel FELS shipyard in Singapore. During the past several months, the board and management of Skeie Drilling & Production ("SKDP") has

<<<

 reviewed its substantial rig construction projects at Keppel FELS in light of the current challenging market fundamentals, including revisiting the delivery schedules of our 3 rigs to match our client's deferred drilling programs.
Based on

<<<

 the deferred drilling programs, SKDP has agreed with the yard to extend the delivery of the rigs with 4 to 6 months. To further enhance the capabilities of our high-end drilling fleet to accommodate the requirements of the clients and to meet

<<<

 all new regulations that have been implemented since the start of the project, SKDP now estimates a total capex and funding requirement just above USD 1,600 million, representing an approx. USD 170 million increase (approx. 10%) for all three

<<<

 rigs compared to our previous expectations. These additional capex/funding requirements also include the funding and supervision cost implications of the agreed 4-6 months extension in the delivery schedule of our 3 newbuilds as well as pre

<<<

-delivery operational expenses.
SKDP has, together with its financial advisor Pareto Securities AS, investigated various routes and alternatives to secure the additional funding requirement.
Reductions in the global asset values and contract

<<<

 drilling rates for offshore drilling rigs world-wide, also demonstrated by the sharp reduction in the share prices of leading public drilling contractors, imply that the current market value of the SKDP equity is marginalized, as SKDP has approx

<<<

 USD 1.4 billion of outstanding debt, debt facilities and unfunded capex.
However, the initiator and main shareholder of SKDP - Skeie Technology ("Skeie") - still has confidence in the future prospects of the 3 N-Class rigs currently under construction

<<<

. Consequently, Skeie and its co-shareholder Wideluck Pte Ltd together holding approx. 60 per cent of the shares in SKDP have developed a proposal involving a re-structuring of the SKDP balance sheet whereby Skeie and Wideluck are prepared to

<<<

 inject up to an additional USD 85 million of new equity into SKDP by underwriting the additional equity issue. Based on this re-structuring proposal, SKDP will again be fully funded through to delivery and will have re-negotiated turnkey yard

<<<

 construction contracts, facilitating completion of our rig construction projects on revised time and budget.

Skeie Drilling & Production
This announcement outlines the Company's proposed solution to attract the new financing within a re-structured

<<<

 capital base on which to complete the construction of the 3 N-Class rigs. The proposed solution is already approved by the Company's board of directors and supported by its core shareholders Skeie and Wideluck who are together underwriting

<<<

 USD 85 million of the required new equity capital to secure completion. The proposed solution is subject to formal approvals by all stakeholder groups including shareholders, bondholders and banks, and additional information is being processed

<<<

 and will be announced in due course. A more detailed presentation of the revised delivery schedule, capex and funding requirements and the proposed re-structuring can be found on the company's web-site www.skeiedrilling.com.
The financial solution

<<<

 consists of the following main elements:
- New equity private placement of USD 85-100 million of which USD 85 million underwritten by Skeie and Wideluck. Current equity to be valued at USD 12 million vs. USD 178 million paid in. Existing shareholders

<<<

, convertible bondholders and 2.pr bondholders to be given preferred allocation;
- Full equity conversion of NOK 660 million (approximately USD 100 million) of SKDP convertible bond debt valued at approx. USD 10 million (10%) at the proposed

<<<

 issue price for new equity of NOK 1 per share, however with recovery value up to 30% subject to convertible bondholders injecting additional new capital in the NOK 1/share equity private placement;
- 2nd priority bond holders with a total of

<<<

 USD 214 million debt reduction (from USD 495 million to USD 281 million). Such debt reductions to be USD 82.5 million on each of the Prodjack 1 and Prodjack 2 USD 165 million par value bond loans (50% recovery) and USD 49.5 million on the USD

<<<

 165 million Prodjack 3 bond loan (70% recovery).
- Existing 2nd priority bondholders (on an individual basis) will, at the reduced value of USD 281 million in total, have the option to either A) maintain their 2nd priority bonds at the reduced

<<<

 par value, or B) convert up to 50% of their bonds into new SKDP shares at NOK 1 per share, or C) convert up to 50% of the bonds into a new SKDP Convertible Bond Loan. Such maximum equity conversion (alt B above) implying 2.pr bondholders may

<<<

 own approx. 50% of the SKDP shares on a fully diluted basis post re-structuring;
- Re-negotiated yard construction contracts and 2.pr bondholder loan agreements.
The revised capital structure reflects a total capital base/enterprise value of

<<<

 approximately USD 1,100 million versus the approx. USD 1,620 million revised cash cost, providing a prudent basis for injecting new equity capital into SKDP as well as providing an attractive recovery potential for all stakeholders if and when

<<<

 rig values recover in the future.
Post-transaction equity value will be an estimated USD 130-140 million, hereunder up to USD 100 million of new, paid-in equity and approx. USD 30-40 million of pre-money equity value from the conversion of

<<<

 existing convertible debt and valuation of existing shares at NOK 1 per share . The remaining approx. USD 950 million will constitute of the USD 675

Skeie Drilling & Production
million 1st priority bank take-out facility and the

<<<

 USD 281 million of re-structured 2nd priority debt (if not further reduced through conversion to SKDP equity at the bondholder's individual options).
The Company is in the process of calling for bondholder meetings to be held in the near future

<<<

 in order to present and seek approvals of the proposed re-structuring and fix. The Company is in dialogue with Norsk Tillitsmann ASA as the Trustee of the convertible and the 2nd priority secured bond loans. The Company aims to conclude this

<<<

 process inclusive of raising new capital by late May 2009.
Due to SKDP's current obligations to inject additional equity by late May 2009 as part of a Prodjack 1 bond covenant, the Company is seeking bondholder approvals by mid May 2009, such

<<<

 approvals being subject to an SKDP Extraordinary Shareholder Meeting approving the re-structuring proposal and the injection of the new equity. Such approval in a subsequent Shareholder Meeting is already supported by the core shareholders

<<<

 and underwriters Skeie and Wideluck currently holding approx. 60% of the outstanding SKDP share capital.
The Company, together with its financial advisor Pareto Securities AS, will work actively to raise the additional equity among SKDP shareholders

<<<

, convertible bondholders, 2.pr bondholders as well as targeting new investors. Due to USD 85 million of underwriting by Skeie and Wideluck, the subscription period for the USD 85-100 million Equity Private Placement will commence once approvals

<<<

 from the involved bondholder groups have been obtained. The post-transaction total valuation (enterprise value) of approximately USD 1,100 million, versus the approximately USD 1,620 million of total revised all-in SKDP capex construction cost

<<<

, is considered to offer a significant upside potential for the re financed SKDP, including a substantially increased subsequent improved recovery potential of the 2.pr bond values if such bondholders use their individual options to convert

<<<

 up to 50% of their remaining bonds into new SKDP equity.
The proposed solution will form the basis for continued construction and a successful preand post-delivery financing of our 3 N-Class jackup newbuilds. The revised delivery schedule implies

<<<

 delivery dates of 29 Sep 2010, 31 December 2010 and 30 June 2011, respectively, representing a 4-6 months extended delivery schedule compared to original delivery dates. We continue to see a number of drilling requirements offshore Norway for

<<<

 start-up in 2010/2011, and the availability of suitable large harsh environment and capable drilling rigs for this niche drilling market continues to look tight. However, in the current market environment we see that operators are hesitant

<<<

 to commit to long-term drilling contracts despite their plans calling for additional drilling requirements. The re structured SKDP capital structure will imply reduced capital costs and lower break-even rates thus enabling SKDP to secure attractive

<<<

 returns even at reduced day rates.
Pareto Securities AS has been mandated to assist the Company in its proposed re structuring.
