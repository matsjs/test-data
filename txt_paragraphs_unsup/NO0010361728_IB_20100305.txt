Rubicon Offshore Holdings Limited Group Management Financial Statements For the twelve months ended 31 December 2009
Background Rubicon is an offshore oilfield service company providing life-of-field development solutions by deploying its fleet

<<<

 of two floating, production, storage and off-loading vessels ("FPSOs") and a multi service vessel ("MSV"). Management review Rubicon is pleased to present its latest management report. The Rubicon Intrepid is located at the Galoc Field, offshore

<<<

 the Philippines, where it is contracted to the Galoc Production Company. As previously reported, on 16 October 2009, the vessel's floating hose, used to periodically offload stored oil to shuttle tankers, was damaged in heavy weather and needed

<<<

 to be replaced. Securing a replacement hose and transporting it to the field took some four weeks, during which time oil stored on the vessel reached capacity. Production thereafter had to be suspended from 20 October 2009 to 9 November 20

<<<

09. An offtake of stored oil was conducted on 10 November 2009 and the FPSO went back into production on the same day. The FPSO remained in production through to 13 January 2010, when bad weather necessitated disconnection of the vessel. The

<<<

 vessel was reconnected and the FPSO went back into production on 28 January 2010. The Rubicon Vantage is located at the Bualuang Field, offshore Thailand, where it is contracted to Salamander Energy. The vessel has continued to achieve good

<<<

 levels of production uptime. The Rubicon Maverick was employed on a contract in Indonesia from 18 October 2009 until 21 December 2009. In mid-January 2010, the vessel was deployed to assist in the reconnection of the Rubicon Intrepid. This

<<<

 assignment lasted through to early-February 2010. The vessel is now being marketed for new work.

In December 2009, Rubicon received US$2.46m as the settlement of insurance claims related to the costs of remedial work undertaken

 at the Galoc Field during June - August 2009. The Group has maintained its focus on careful management of cash, improving the stability of operations and maximizing vessel utilization. Board of Directors, 1 March 2010
