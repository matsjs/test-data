Oslo, 3 February 2010

RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL - SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING
1. INTRODUCTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the 

<<<

"Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001 036034.0 (the "Loan") issued by Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited ("Remedial").
All

<<<

 capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement governing the Bonds dated 23 March, 2007 between Remedial and the Loan Trustee (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated in this summons.

2.

<<<

 BACKGROUND
On 27 July, Remedial announced that it expected to initiate a restructuring of its current financial position or would require the injection of additional capital before the end of 2009. Remedial further announced on 18 September

<<<

 2009 that its free cash position would be at a critically low level by the end of September 2009. At the end of November 2009, the cash position of Remedial was US$ 0.3 million in free cash and US$56.5 million of blocked funds in the Escrow

<<<

 Account for the Bonds.
The funds in the Escrow Account were blocked because there was a continuing Event of Default in existence under the terms of the Loan Agreement, as a consequence of Remedial's failure to make an interest payment on the

<<<

 Bonds on 28 September 2009.
On 18 September 2009, Remedial had requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to seek amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement, including the deferral of interest. On 1 October 2009, upon a

<<<

 request from the Loan Trustee, Remedial agreed to defer the call for a Bondholders' meeting to permit Bondholders to consider and respond to Remedial's proposed amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement. In order to assist with the consideration

<<<

 of such proposals, the Loan Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders, engaged independent advisors, AMA Capital Partners LLC ("AMA") and Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham") (together the "Advisors") to perform due diligence on Remedial and

<<<

 give advice on the Bondholders' position and the proposed amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement. The Advisors' engagement is supported by more than 50% of the Bondholders. The Advisors have been in direct contact with an ad hoc committee

<<<

 of Bondholders holding approximately 60% of the outstanding Bonds (the "Committee").

www. i him cc.n o
Since that time the Advisors have undertaken due diligence on Remedial, and have held numerous discussions and meetings with Remedial

<<<

's management and advisers. These discussions have centred around how to address Remedial's significant liquidity shortfall. In particular, Remedial had requested that Bondholders defer interest payable on the Bonds, and release all escrowed

<<<

 funds to Remedial by way of working capital. In turn, Cosco (Nantong) Shipyard Ltd ("Cosco") and Yantai Raffles Shipyard Ltd ("Yantai") which are building the Vessels (the "Yards"), would (unless otherwise agreed by the Loan Trustee in consultation

<<<

 with the Advisors) each be required to agree to defer the final US$7 million payable on delivery of each of the vessels for a period of 12 months.
In consultation with the Committee, the Advisors indicated that Bondholders may be amenable to

<<<

 assist Remedial with an interest deferral and a release of most of the escrowed funds, provided that a contribution was also made from Remedial's shareholders so that Bondholders could retain at least US$7 million of the escrowed funds to ensure

<<<

 that they could perfect a first priority mortgage over ESV2 (in the expectation that this would be the first vessel to deliver), and so that Remedial would have a reasonable amount of working capital going forward. After discussions with Remedial

<<<

's major shareholders, it became apparent to Remedial's management and advisers, however, that the necessary investment was not available from Remedial's principal shareholders.
Accordingly, the Advisors, in consultation with the Committee,

<<<

 put forth a proposal for the restructuring of Remedial in the form of the term sheet set out in Appendix A to this summons (the "Term Sheet"). This proposal is detailed in section 3 below. The key terms of the proposal are a debt for equity

<<<

 swap where all of the indebtedness under the Bonds other than $56.5 million is exchanged on a pro rata basis for new shares representing 95% of Remedial's post-restructuring share capital, with the remaining 5% of the share to be retained by

<<<

 the current shareholders. The residual US$56.5 million of indebtedness under the Bonds would be made available to Remedial for general working capital purposes, restructuring costs and shipyard payments to procure delivery of the Vessels in

<<<

 the form of a loan. The Advisors have indicated that the Committee in principle is supportive of a restructuring in the form of the proposal, and that this is likely to present the only remaining opportunity for a consensual restructuring of

<<<

 Remedial's balance sheet that would avoid the alternative of insolvency proceedings. The Advisors suggested that Remedial was left with little option in the circumstances but to propose a restructuring in the form of the Term Sheet to both

<<<

 Remedial's shareholders and the Bondholders.
Accordingly, Remedial summoned an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders that was held on 14 December 2009 (the "EGM"), in order to approve various resolutions (the "EGM Resolutions")

<<<

, and in particular those required to implement the proposal from the Advisors. All resolutions were approved by the extraordinary general meeting. A copy of the minutes from the EGM is attached at Appendix B to this summons.
At the EGM, three

<<<

 new members were elected for the board of directors. Svein Eggen was nominated by current shareholders, while Eugene Davis and James Dolphin were nominated by the Bondholders. Bradley Scher was also subsequently appointed to the Board. The

<<<

 Board now consists of these four directors, with Eugene Davis as Chairman.
Remedial also opted to have a three member director nomination committee comprising of the Chairman and two representatives of the Bondholders as future shareholders

<<<

. The existing members of the board nomination committee resigned on the date of the EGM, and Ivan Capriello from Deutsche Bank and Monish Sahni from CQS Management Limited, were
2

6

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA

www,i nisiw .no

elected

<<<

 upon nomination by the Bondholders. Eugene Davis also became a member of the nomination committee in his capacity as Chairman of the board.
Due to its critical cash position, Remedial approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders' meeting

<<<

 before setting out the proposal to the bondholders from the Advisors, in order to consider a partial release of US$3 million of the funds that were held in the Escrow Account in order to allow closing of the Restructuring Proposal (if approved

<<<

) or otherwise to allow Remedial to make arrangements with the Advisors for an organised winddown of its affairs. That funding proposal was approved by the necessary majority of the Bondholders on 11 December 2009. The Loan Trustee was also

<<<

 authorised to move the balance of the proceeds of the Bonds from the Escrow Account to an account held in the name of the Loan Trustee (the "NTM Account"). In return for the release of the US$3 million of funds from the NTM Account, additional

<<<

 security was provided by Remedial over certain OFE engines and rack and chord leg material. The summons for that Bondholders' meeting which explains the funding arrangement is attached at Appendix C to this summons.
Pursuant to the resolutions

<<<

 passed at the Bondholders' meeting held on 11 December 2009, US$3 million was subsequently released from the funds held in the NTM Account in order to enable Remedial to meet its working capital requirements. Following that release, the balance

<<<

 on the monies transferred into the NTM Account stood at (and is currently) US$53.5 million. Substantially all of those US$3 million of funds have now been expended by Remedial. By the end of January 2010, Remedial's free cash position was US

<<<

$0.5 million cash only. Remedial will shortly require further funding to meet its on-going working capital requirements. Remedial has not indentified any alternative sources of funding. Accordingly, if the Restructuring Proposal (as described

<<<

 below) is not approved by the Bondholders, or the conditions precedent to the implementation of the Restructuring Propsal are not satisfied or waived, Remedial expects to make arrangements for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs and

<<<

 the realisation of its assets, in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders and, to the extent of Remedial's unsecured assets, Remedial's other creditors.
Please refer to the Remedial's third quarter release of 2009 attached as Appendix

<<<

 D to this summons which is intended to provide the last reported statement of Remedial's financial and operational status. Bondholders are encouraged to read all of the documents attached to this summons.
3. THE RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
Remedial

<<<

 has asked the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders' meeting to approve the proposed restructuring summarised below, which reflects the proposal set out in the Term Sheet. The necessary resolutions to implement the proposal were approved by

<<<

 Remedial's shareholders at the EGM (the "Restructuring Proposal").
3.1 Partial conversion to shares and write down o f theprincipal
The Restructuring Proposal includes a conversion to equity of all indebtedness (including accrued but unpaid

<<<

 interest) under the Loan other than US$56.5 million (the "Residual Loan") through the issuance to the Bondholders of new ordinary shares on a pro rata basis representing 95% of the post-restructuring share capital of Remedial (the "Bondholder

<<<

 Shares"). It is intended that Remedial's shares, including the Bondholder Shares, will remain listed on the Oslo Axess. The listing of the Bondholder Shares will be subject to the approval of Oslo Axess and the publication of a listing prospectus

<<<

. It is expected that the Bondholder Shares will be listed within four weeks of the date of the Bondholders' meeting. The new share capital of Remedial after the issuance of the Bondholder Shares to the Bondholders will

3

N O R SK T IL L

<<<

 IT SM A N N ASA www. trustee, no
be 588,818,480 shares with a nominal value of NOK 0.00025. The Bondholders will receive 559,377,556 ordinary shares of Remedial with a nominal value of NOK 0.0025 each.
Remedial's current shareholders passed

<<<

 the EGM Resolutions at the EGM held on 14 December 2009 for the authorisation of the increase of share capital sufficient for the issue of the Bondholder Shares, and the subsequent issuance of the Bondholder Shares. This authorisation is effective

<<<

 until 14 February 2010.
Following the issuance of the Bondholder Shares, the current shareholders of Remedial will retain 5% of the post-restructuring share capital of Remedial (the "Existing Shares").
The Bondholder Shares may be subject to

<<<

 dilution if Remedial implements the Rights Issue described in paragraph 3.4 below, and all post-restructuring shareholders will be subject to dilution by any shares issued in respect of a management incentive scheme as described in paragraph

<<<

 3.5 below.
3.2 Residual Loan
The Residual Loan of US$56.5 million that will remain in place following the proposed restructuring is an amount equivalent to the aggregate of (i) the US$53.5 million balance currently held in the NTM Account,

<<<

 and (ii) the US$3 million which was advanced to Remedial from the NTM Account pursuant to the resolutions passed at the Bondholders' meeting held on 11 December 2009.
If the Restructuring Proposal is approved, the remaining US$53.5 million

<<<

 in the NTM Account will be made available to Remedial for use for restructuring costs, agreed shipyard payments to procure delivery of the Vessels and for general working capital purposes. Of this, US$1.5million would be used to settle the

<<<

 unsecured claims of Swedbank AB and SEB Enskilda AS against Remedial as detailed in section 3.3 below. Remedial's current cashflow forecasts anticipate that the US$53.5 million will be exhausted by the end of June. Remedial would also intend

<<<

 to seek to raise at least a further US$20 million in additional financing (debt or equity) following the restructuring to cover the period up to the end of December. The proposed restructuring and additional financing will allow Remedial to

<<<

 take delivery of the two Vessels, and seek employment or sale opportunities for them in a non-distressed environment.
Attached to this summons at Appendix E is a copy of the latest draft of the proposed loan agreement with respect to the Residual

<<<

 Loan to be entered into by Remedial and the Loan Trustee in the event that the Restructuring Proposal is approved. This remains subject to final agreement, and is subject to such amendments as the Loan Trustee may agree in consultation with

<<<

, and based on feedback from, the Committee and the Advisors, taking into account that, following the proposed restructuring, the Bondholders in the Residual Loan will also be Remedial's majority shareholders (the "Draft Loan Agreement").
However

<<<

, on any basis the Draft Loan Agreement will provide for, inter alia, interest on the Residual Loan to accrue at a rate of at least 10.00% per annum. Interest will be capitalised and added to the principal amount of the Residual Loan until the

<<<

 first interest payment date falling at least 30 days after the commencement date of the charter of either of the Vessels. Following the charter of either of the Vessels, interest will be payable in cash. The Interest Payment Dates will remain

<<<

 the same.
It is a proposed term of the Residual Loan that each of the Construction Contracts shall be transferred to separate Vessel Owning Companies. The Vessel Owning Companies are likely
4

N O R SK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
w w w , i m .sK'L

<<<

.no
to be established in Bahamas and will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Remedial. The Vessel Owning Companies shall provide security over the Construction Contracts which shall at least be the same as the existing Loan Security, and a mortgage

<<<

 over the Vessels upon completion, in each case in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee,, In addition, Remedial and the Vessel Owning Companies shall, provide a floating charge in favour of the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders in

<<<

 the Residual Loan) over all their business and assets.
The Loan Agreement shall permit the granting of first priority mortgages in favour of the Yards with respect to the deferred instalments due to them, but the Yards will be required to waive

<<<

 any rights of counterclaim or set-off which they may have and it will be a requirement that the Loan Trustee and the Bondholders shall have a direct right to repay the Yard on the deferred amount due to them. The Yards will also be required

<<<

 to provide written consent to the granting of the security in favour of the Loan Trustee and the transfer of the Construction Contracts to the Vessel Owning Companies. The Loan Trustee shall be entitled to waive these requirements in consultation

<<<

 with the Advisors.
The Loan Agreement shall also allow for an additional debt facility of US$20 million to be secured against the Vessels ranking on pari passu with the Residual Loan.
3.3 Swedbank AB and SEB Enskilda
It is a condition precedent

<<<

 to the proposed restructuring that Remedial agrees to compromise two significant unsecured claims from financial institutions for no more than US$1.5 million. The first of these is a claim by Swedbank AB (publ) ("Swedbank") of approximately

<<<

 US$7.2 million which has terminated three interest rate swap confirmations with Swedbank governed by an ISDA master agreement dated 20 November 2008 (the "Swap Contracts") following a missed payment which was due on 28 September 2009. The second

<<<

 is a claim from SEB Enskilda AB ("SEB") of up to US$2.6 million under an engagement letter dated 17 July 2009 (the "Engagement Letter"), pursuant to which SEB was engaged by Remedial to provide financial advice on a restructuring of Remedial

<<<

's capital structure.
The proposed restructuring will not be viable if Remedial cannot compromise any obligation it may to pay these amounts in full. Further, Remedial has received feedback from the Committee that they will not support payments

<<<

 of this magnitude being made in full to unsecured creditors who are not critical to the delivery of the Vessels. However, the Committee has suggested that it will support a settlement of these claims in an aggregate amount of up to US$1.5 million

<<<

 (up to US$1.25 million to Swedbank and up to US$0.25 million to SEB). This is estimated to be more than these claims would receive in an insolvency proceeding for Remedial, where SEB would not be entitled to any payment at all.
It shall be

<<<

 a condition precedent to the implementation of the Restructuring Proposal that agreement with Swedbank and SEB on these terms is achieved by the date of the Bondholders' meeting in relation to this summons.
3.4 Rights issue
The shareholder

<<<

 resolutions passed at the EGM authorised (but did not require) Remedial to carry out a rights issue of shares for an aggregate gross subscription price of US$20 million at a pre-money equity valuation of US$161.3 million (the "Rights Issue

<<<

") which must be closed and subscribed for within 45 days of the issuance of the Bondholder Shares to the Bondholders. Only the pre-restructuring shareholders (the shareholders holding 5% of the post-restructuring shares) would be given a right

<<<

 to subscribe. The board of directors will determine the record date for the Rights Issue which will be prior to the date of the issue of
5

N O RSK TILLITSM A N N ASA
WWW. UTI sl cc. no
shares to the Bondholders. The subscription rights would

<<<

 be tradable and would be exercisable by any person who acquires such subscription rights. A complete subscription of the shares available under the terms of the Rights Issue would result in the issuance of 73,009,111 new shares (the "Rights

<<<

 Issue Shares"). The Rights Issue Shares would have a nominal value of US$0.0025 each and be subscribed for at a premium of US$ 0.2714 (i.e. for the total price of US dollar 0.2739) per share.
Following such a Rights Issue, and assuming subscription

<<<

 in full for the Rights Issue Shares, the Bondholders would own approximately 84.5% of the enlarged share capital of Remedial and 100% of the Residual Loan. The new share capital of Remedial, in the event that the Rights Issue was completed

<<<

, would be 661,827,591 shares ofNOK 0.0025 each.
3.5 Management Incentive Scheme
The Restructuring Proposal provides for the creation of a management incentive scheme whereby Remedial's board of directors will be authorised to grant to Remedial

<<<

's management warrants or options to acquire shares representing an amount equal to up to 5% of the postrestructuring share capital (after taking into account the issuance of any Rights Issue Shares) prior to the granting of any such warrants

<<<

 or options. This was approved at the EGM.
3.6 The Vessels and the Yards
Each of the Yards have agreed (in the case of Yantai, in principle) to defer instalments of US$7 million each due to them under the terms of the Construction Contracts

<<<

. The Restructuring Proposal provides for security to be provided to the Yards, with respect to those deferred instalments of US$7 million each, in the form of a secured note (the "Yard Notes") secured by a first-ranking mortgage over the respective

<<<

 Vessels. The Yard Notes shall be payable 12 months after delivery of each of the Vessels, will accrue interest on an annual basis at a rate of 3.00% per annum. Cosco and Yantai (in the case of Yantai, in principle) have also given Remedial

<<<

 the option to store the Vessels at the Yards, free of charge, for a period of three and six months respectively after delivery.
It shall be a condition precedent to the implementation of the Restructuring Proposal that the Yards (a) provide

<<<

 written consent to the granting of the security in favour of the Loan Trustee, (b) provide written consent to the transfer of the Construction Contracts to the Vessel Owning Companies, (c) waive any rights of counterclaim or set-off which they

<<<

 may have and (d) allow the Loan Trustee or the Bondholders to have a direct right to repay the Yard Notes from the amounts held in the Escrow Account or otherwise. The documentation of these agreements and terms with the Yards shall be in a

<<<

 form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (in consultation with the Advisors). However, the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to waive these conditions precedent in consultation with the Advisors.
3.7 Conditions
The Bondholders' acceptance of the

<<<

 Restructuring Proposal is conditional on the following (provided that (i) may be waived by the Loan Trustee in consultation with the Advisors):
(i) execution of documentation reflecting the terms of the agreements with the Yards detailed above

<<<

, in a form satisfactory of the Loan Trustee (in consultation with the Advisors) by no later that the date of the Bondholders' meeting in relation to this summons; and
6

N O R SK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
w w w .iniN fcc.no
(ii) execution of agreements

<<<

 for the settlement of the SEB and Swedbank claims in relation to the Engagement Letter and Swap Contracts respectively, for an aggregate amount of no more than US$1.5 million in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (in consultation with

<<<

 the Advisors) by no later than the date of the Bondholders' meeting in relation to this summons.
The amendments to the Loan Agreement shall be conditional upon the issuance to Bondholders of the Bondholder Shares.
4. EVALUATION OF THE RESTRUCTURING

<<<

 PROPOSAL
4.1 Effect o f the restructuring Proposal
Remedial's current cashflow forecasts anticipate that the US$53.5 million will be exhausted by the end of June. Remedial would also intend to seek to raise at least a further US$20 million

<<<

 in additional financing (debt or equity) following the restructuring to cover the period up to the end of December. The proposed restructuring and such additional financing will allow Remedial to take delivery of the two Vessels, and seek employment

<<<

 or sale opportunities for them in a non-distressed environment.
4.2 Remedial's evaluation of the Restructuring Proposal
Remedial believes that the Restructuring Proposal will have a positive effect on the overall capital structure of Remedial

<<<

 and the interests of its stakeholders, following completion of the Restructuring Proposal.
4.3 Non-reliance
Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by any of the Loan Trustee, AMA or Bingham. Bondholders should independently

<<<

 evaluate the Restructuring Proposal and vote accordingly.
5. FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
In the event that the Restructuring Proposal is not approved, or the conditions precedent are not satisfied or waived, it will not be possible

<<<

 to implement the Restructuring Proposal. At that stage, Remedial will have no further funds available to it, and Remedial does not expect that Bondholders will provide further funding to it as a going concern. In such circumstances, the board

<<<

 of Remedial expects to make arrangements for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs and a realisation of its assets in a manner that seeks to maximise recoveries and value for the Bondholders and (to the extent of its unsecured assets

<<<

) other creditors.
Remedial is currently in discussion with the Advisors to plan for this eventuality. It is expected that the Loan Trustee will enforce the security for the Loan (most likely through the appointment of a Cypriot law receiver

<<<

 which may or may not be followed by a liquidation of Remedial), or in the alternative that agreement will be reached for the commencement of Chapter 11 Proceedings in the United States to effect a sale of Remedial's assets.
In such circumstances

<<<

, there will still be a requirement for funding to be made available from the NTM Account to prepare for and implement such actions (hereinafter described as the "Recovery Loans"). Following consultation with the Advisors, it is therefore proposed

<<<

 that the Bondholders' meeting provide the necessary approvals to the Loan Trustee to provide this funding from the NTM Account, as described below.

5.1 Recovery Loans - Chapter 11 proceedings

<<<


Iri the event that agreement is reached between Remedial and the Advisors (in consultation with the Committee) for the commencement of Chapter 11 proceedings if the Restructuring Proposal cannot be implemented, Remedial would need to be provided

<<<

 with funding for costs incurred both prior to and during the Chapter 11 proceedings.
Remedial will need to be in position to meet the costs and expenses of its own legal advisers in preparing to commence Chapter 11 proceedings. It is therefore

<<<

 proposed that the Loan Trustee be authorised to provide additional funding for this purpose of up to $250,000 from the funds currently held in the NTM Account. Such amount would be advanced to Remedial under the terms of the existing Loan Agreement

<<<

 and shall be secured by the security already granted in relation to the US$3 million partial release which was approved at the Bondholders' meeting held on 11 December 2009 (as explained above, and the summons for which is attached as Appendix

<<<

 C).
It is proposed that the Loan Trustee be authorised to provide funding from the NTM Account for the period following the filing of the petition commencing Chapter 11 proceedings in the form of a super priority debtor-in-possession loan 

<<<

(a "DIP Loan"). The terms of the DIP Loan would be on market standard terms as negotiated by the Advisors in consultation with the Loan Trustee and the Committee, including a requirement that, subject to approval of the US Bankruptcy Court,

<<<

 Remedial provides adequate protection collateral over all of its unsecured assets to the extent of the DIP Loan. The amount of a DIP Loan to be made available from the NTM Account shall not exceed US$5 million without further approval of the

<<<

 Bondholders. It should be noted that this amount would cover several areas of costs, including the following: firstly, Remedial's own legal costs, and the legal costs of any unsecured creditors' committee, which are estimated to be in the region

<<<

 of US$1,000,000US$1,500,000; secondly, the running costs of Remedial during the Chapter 11 proceedings: these are effectively some of the same costs that would have been incurred by Remedial had the proposed restructuring been implemented and

<<<

 had Remedial therefore had access to the funds in the NTM Account; and thirdly, the costs and expenses of the Advisors, which it is expected would need to be covered by Remedial as a term of the DIP Loan.
5.2 Recovery Loans - costs o f receiver

<<<

/liquidator
In the event that it is determined by the Loan Trustee, in consultation with the Advisors and the Committee that the Loan Trustee should appoint a receiver over the assets secured in its favour, the Loan Trustee will need to provide

<<<

 funding, and potentially an indemnity to the receiver. In such circumstances, it is proposed that the Loan Trustee be authorised to meet (or undertake to cover) the fees, costs and expenses of the receiver (including, without limitation, the

<<<

 cost of hiring management teams at the Yards) out of the NTM Account in an amount up to US$5 million, and to provide an indemnity to the receiver up to the extent of the assets secured in favour of the Loan Trustee in relation to the Loan Agreement

<<<

 (including any balance remaining from time to time in the NTM Account).
It is also possible that Remedial may enter into liquidation in Cyprus, either alongside or instead of a receivership. In this event, the liquidator may need funding in

<<<

 order to be in a position to take steps to realise Remedial's assets. In such circumstances, it is proposed that the Loan Trustee be authorised to meet (or undertake to cover) the fees, costs and expenses of a liquidator out of the NTM Account

<<<

 in an amount up to US$5 million (less any funds advanced in meeting, or committed to meet, the fees, costs and expenses of a receiver).
8

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
w w w .tni.srir.no
It is proposed that any funds made available from

<<<

 the NTM Account to a receiver or a liquidator would be on terms to be agreed by the Loan Trustee, following consultation with the Advisors and the Committee, and provided that it is confirmed that they will be an expense of the receivership

<<<

 or the liquidation respectively, repayable on the applicable super priority basis.

An annual extraordinary meeting o f Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited was held on 14th December 2009 at 19:00 p.m. The following issues were on the agenda:

<<<

 M EETING AND T H E REGISTRATION OF T H E ATTENDING SHAREHOLDERS:

The Meeting was called by 21 days' notice in writing. Thereafter the Chairman declared the Meeting opened having satisfied himself that there was

<<<

 a quorum in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, i.e. 5 members holding 69,7% of the issued sharecapital of the Company, and he submits before the meeting further details on certain items of the Agenda.
(4) REASON FOR

<<<

 T H E CALL FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING
The Chairman referred that on 18 September 2009, the Company requested Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee"), as loan trustee for the Company's Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 (the

<<<

 "Loan"), to summon a bondholders' meeting to seek amendments to the Loan terms. On 1 October 2009, upon request from the Loan Trustee, the Company agreed to defer the call for a bondholders' meeting to permit bondholders to consider and respond

<<<

 to the Company's proposed amendments to the Loan terms. On behalf of the bondholders, the Loan Trustee engaged a financial advisor (AMA Capital Partners LLC) and a legal adviser (Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP) (together "the Advisors") to

<<<

 perform due diligence of the Company and give advice < te \ the bondholders' position and the proposed
/V amendments. There is a continuing EventaHof Default under the terms of the Loan as a
611-Doc09 (Minutes of E.G.M. dated 14.12..09) REMEDIAL

 (CYPRUS) PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED

K
2
consequence of the failure by the Company to make an interest payment which was due on 28 September 2009.
There have been ongoing discussions between the Company and the Advisors for some time to seek to

<<<

 agree the best terms for effecting a restructuring o f the Company's balance sheet. In the absence of financial support from the Company's principal shareholders on terms that were acceptable to bondholders, the Advisors have set forth a draft

<<<

 proposal for restructuring of the Company. The Advisors indicate that this proposal has been discussed with a steering committee that represents slightly more than fifty percent o f the bondholders and that this proposal is likely to be accepted

<<<

 by a majority o f the bondholders at a bondholders meeting. The proposal would place the Company in a fully financed position for approximately the next twelve months.
The draft proposal would result in a conversion to equity of all indebtedness

<<<

 under the Loan (other than $56.5 million) through the issue to the bondholders o f new ordinary listed shares representing 95% o f the post-restructuring share capital o f the Company. The remaining proceeds of the bond issue which are currently

<<<

 escrowed (being $56.5 million) would be available to the Company for use for agreed shipyard payments to procure delivery of the ESV vessels (provided that a payment of US$7million to each shipyard would be deferred for twelve months) and general

<<<

 corporate purposes. In addition the proposal allows for an additional debt facility of $20 million to be secured against the ESV vessels ranking on an equal basis to the remaining Loan. Finally, the proposal provides for security to the shipyards

<<<

 constructing the Company's vessels with respect to their deferred amounts of $7 million each, in the form of notes secured by a first-ranking mortgage over the respective vessels. Those notes will accrue interest on an annual basis at a rate

<<<

 of 3% per annum and the shipyards will waive any rights of counterclaim or set-off which they may have in relation to them.
The Company will also have the right to carry out a rights issue o f shares which must be closed and subscribed for

<<<

 within 45 days of the issuance of shares to the Bondholders, for the aggregate gross subscription price of $20 million at a pre-money equity valuation of $161.3 million, for which the current (pre restructuring) shareholders shall be given

<<<

 the right to subscribe. The board o f directors will determine the ex-right date for the rights issue. The ex right date for the rights issue will be a date not earlier than the date after the date of the general meeting, but prior to the date

<<<

 on which shares are issued to the bondholders. Following such a rights issue, the bondholders would own approximately 84.5% of the enlarged share capital and 100% of the residual Loan.
The new share capital of the Company after the issuance

<<<

 of new ordinary shares to the bondholders will be 588,818,480, while the new share capital of the Company after a rights issue will be 661,827,591.
The proposal also allows for a management incentive scheme whereby the Company's board of directors

<<<

 will be authorised to grant to the Company's management warrants or options to acquire shares representing an amount equal to 5% of the post-restructuring share capital prior to the granting of any such warrants or options.
In order to give

<<<

 effect to the proposal received /from the Advisors a number o f resolutions are required to be passed by the Company's shareholders and the bondholders. In the event that

 COMPANY LIMITED

3
the resolutions of the Company's bondholders and shareholders to implement the proposal are not passed, the Company will likely need to enter into formal insolvency proceedings, which are expected to result in shareholders

<<<

 losing the entire value o f their shares in the Company.
Bjorge Gretland and Knut Borgen have notified the Company that they wish to resign from the position as members of the board of directors at the day of the general meeting. Svein Eggen

<<<

, Greg Coleman and Ola Lorentzon have notified the Company that they wish to resign from their position as members of the board at the day of the general meeting if the resolutions set out in item 5 and 6 below are being resolved, and within

<<<

 30 days after the day of the general meeting if the resolutions set out in item 5 and 6 below are not being resolved. The current nomination committee consisting of Svein Eggen, Lars Christian Wiese and Gabriel Berg will also retire if the

<<<

 resolutions set out in item 5 and 6 below are being resolved.
If the proposal received by the Advisors is approved by shareholders, at least 4 of the current directors will resign and the Chairman o f the meeting will be authorised to appoint

<<<

 new directors to the board, which will be at least two directors approved by bondholders and one director appointed by the current shareholders. The new board will then be entitled to appoint two further directors to the board.
The resolutions

<<<

 of the Company's shareholders required to implement the proposal are set out in items 5 to 8 below. The Board of Directors of the Company recommends that the Company's shareholders vote in favour of each of the resolutions set out in items

<<<

 5 to 8 below, as the Board o f Directors at this stage sees no other alternative that will permit the Company to satisfy all its obligations and allow shareholders to retain some value with respect to their shares in the Company.
(5) AUTHORISATION

<<<

 TO INCREASE TH E AUTHORIZED SHARE CAPITAL OF THE COMPANY
The Chairman referred that the draft proposal received requires a significant number of new shares to be issued which makes it necessary to increase the authorized share capital of the

<<<

 Company.
The Board o f Directors therefore proposes that the general meeting passes the following special resolution:
1. THAT the authorized share capital o f the Company is increased from $150,000 U.S. dollars divided into 60,000,000 shares

<<<

 o f a nominal value o f $0.0025 U.S. dollars each share to $1,750,000 U.S. dollars divided into 700,000,000 shares o f a nominal value of $0.0025 U.S. dollars each share.
The resolution above is subject to (i) an amendment agreement to the

<<<

 agreement governing the Loan reasonably satisfactory to the Board of Directors having been authorised, executed and delivered by the Loan Trustee following approval at a meeting of Bondholders and (ii) the proposals set out in item 6 of the

<<<

<<<

 holders of the Bonds.
The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the general meeting passes the following special resolutions:
1. THAT the Board of Directors be and is hereby authorised to issue 559,377,556 new ordinary listed shares with

<<<

 to Bondholders. The current (pre restructuring) shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe for such shares which shall be on a pro rata basis to the extent there is over-subscription.
The Board o f Directors therefore proposes that the general

<<<

 meeting passes the following special resolutions:1

 2009

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING
1. INTRODUCTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001 036034

<<<

.0 (the "Loan") issued by Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited ("Remedial").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement governing the Bonds dated 23 March, 2007 between Remedial and the

<<<

 Loan Trustee (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated in this summons.

The information in this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability

<<<

 whatsoever related to such information.
2. BACKGROUND
On 27 July 2009, Remedial announced that it expected to initiate a restructuring of its current financial position or would require the injection of additional capital before the end of

<<<

 2009. Remedial further announced on 18 September 2009 that its free cash position would be at a critically low level by the end of September 2009. At the end of November 2009, the cash position of Remedial was $0.3 million in free cash and

<<<

 $56.5 million of blocked funds in the Escrow Account for the Bonds. Accordingly, absent agreement with the Bondholders, Remedial is facing a severe funding shortfall which requires to be resolved if Remedial is to secure the delivery of the

<<<

 ESV1 and ESV2 vessels and continue its immediate operations.
The blocking of the Escrow Account arises since there is a continuing Event of Default in existence under the terms of the Loan Agreement, as a consequence of Remedial's failure to

<<<

 make the interest payment on the Bonds due on 28 September 2009.
On 18 September 2009, Remedial had requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to seek amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement, including the deferral of

<<<

 interest. On 1 October 2009, upon a request from the Loan Trustee, Remedial agreed to defer the call for a Bondholders' meeting to permit Bondholders to consider and respond to Remedial's proposed amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement

<<<

. In order to assist with the consideration of such proposals, the Loan Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders, engaged independent advisors, AMA Capital Partners LLC ("AMA") and Bingham McCutchen

(London) LLP ("Bingham

<<<

") (together the "Advisors") to perform due diligence on Remedial and give advice on the Bondholders' position and the proposed amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement. The engagement is supported by more than 50 % of the Bondholders.

<<<

 The Advisors have been in direct contact with an ad hoc committee of Bondholders holding approximately 60% of the outstanding Bonds (the "Committee").
Since that time Bingham and AMA have undertaken due diligence on Remedial, and have held

<<<

 numerous discussions and meetings with Remedial's management and advisers.
The Advisors, in consultation with the Committee, have put forth a proposal for the restructuring of Remedial in the form of a term sheet (the "Term Sheet"). The Advisors

<<<

 have indicated that the Committee in principle is supportive of a restructuring in the form of that proposal, and that this is likely to present the only remaining opportunity for a consensual restructuring of Remedial's balance sheet that

<<<

 would avoid the alternative of insolvency proceedings. The Advisors have suggested that Remedial is left with little option in the circumstances but to propose a restructuring in the form of the Term Sheet to both Remedial's shareholders and

<<<

 the Bondholders.
Remedial has summoned an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to be held on 14 December 2009 (the "EGM"), in order to approve various resolutions (the "EGM Resolutions"), and in particular those required to implement

<<<

 the Term Sheet. Remedial will, within the next couple of days, request the Loan Trustee to summon a bondholders meeting for the approval of the restructuring proposal set forth by the Advisors in the Term Sheet (the "Restructuring Proposal

<<<

"). The Term Sheet will be appended to that meeting summons.
Due to its critical cash position, Remedial has however approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders' meeting before this, to consider permitting a partial release of up to

<<<

 $3.0 million of the funds currently held in the Escrow Account up to and including 13 January 2010 to allow Remedial to meet on-going financial obligations up to the time of the EGM and (a) if the necessary EGM proposals and the Restructuring

<<<

 Proposal are approved, for a short period thereafter to allow closing of the Restructuring Proposal, or (b) in the event that the necessary EGM proposals and/or the Restructuring Proposal are not approved, to allow Remedial to make arrangements

<<<

 with the Advisors for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders.
Please refer to Remedial's third quarter release of 2009 attached as Appendix B to this summons which is intended to give

<<<

 an update of Remedial's financial and operational status. Bondholders are encouraged to read the attached document.
3. THE ESCROW PROPOSAL
Due its critical cash position, Remedial has approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders meeting

<<<

 to consider permitting a partial release of up to $3.0 million of the funds currently held in the Escrow Account up to and including 13 January 2010 to allow Remedial to meet on-going financial obligations up to the time of the EGM and (a)

<<<

 if the necessary EGM proposals and the Restructuring Proposal are approved, for a short period thereafter to allow closing of the Restructuring Proposal, or (b) in the event that the necessary EGM proposals and/or the Restructuring Proposal

<<<

 are not approved, to allow Remedial to make arrangements with the Advisors for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders. The costs to be covered by the proposed partial release of up

<<<

 to $3.0 million of the funds currently held in the Escrow Account are mainly costs of operations, general and administrative costs, vessel capital expenditure costs,

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA

payments to legal and

<<<

 financial advisers to Remedial and the Loan Trustee and other operational running obligations.
The proposal to release to Remedial some of the funds currently held in the Escrow Account is set out further in this section (the "Proposal").


<<<

3.1 Release offundsfrom the Escrow Account
The Escrow Account is currently held by The Winterbotham Trust Company Limited in its capacity as escrow agent under the terms of an escrow agreement dated 23 March 2007 between Remedial, the Loan Trustee

<<<

 and The Winterbotham Trust Company Limited. The monies in the Escrow Account are also subject to a first ranking Bahamian law pledge in favour of the Loan Trustee as security for the Loan which may currently be enforced following the occurrence

<<<

 of the Event of Default occasioned by non-payment of accrued interest on the Loan. It is proposed that all monies held in the Escrow Account (together with all interest accrued thereon) shall be moved to a US dollar trust account held by and

<<<

 in the name of the Loan Trustee (the "Loan Trustee Account"). Remedial and the Loan Trustee shall, within two Banking Days of the passing of the resolutions set out in this summons, jointly in writing instruct The Winterbotham Trust Company

<<<

 Limited in its capacity as escrow agent in relation to the Escrow Account to effect this transfer immediately.
Remedial will be entitled to submit to the Loan Trustee one or more requests for the release of monies held in the Loan Trustee Account

<<<

 on or before 13 January 2010 (a "Release Request") which shall be accompanied by a cashflow forecast for the following four weeks. The Loan Trustee, in consultation with AMA, shall promptly consider such Release Request (taking into account

<<<

 the latest cashflow forecasts provided by Remedial and discussions with management of Remedial). Remedial will promptly respond to any queries raised by the Loan Trustee or AMA in relation to any such Release Request. The Loan Trustee will

<<<

 not be obliged to release any monies from the Loan Trustee Account, and will only be authorised to release monies from the Loan Trustee Account with the approval of AMA. The maximum aggregate amount which may be released from the Loan Trustee

<<<

 Account without further approval from the Bondholders is $3.0 million.
Unless the Loan Trustee agrees otherwise (based on advice from Bingham that it is not possible to take all or part of such security), all amounts advanced to Remedial under

<<<

 the terms of the Loan Agreement, including any funds released to Remedial from the Loan Trustee Account, shall be secured over:
(a) three GE Model 7FDM16 diesel engines with generator and one GE Model 7FDM8 with generator which were constructed

<<<

 by LeTourneau Technologies Power Systems pursuant to a purchase order dated 6 August 2007 with Remedial Offshore Limited and which are currently being stored by Advance Rig Services LLC at their yard in Houston, Texas; and
(b) (b) 216 feet

 of 6" gear rack, 2,543 feet of 5" gear rack, and 1,728 feet of half chord for 6" and 5" gear rack, which were acquired from and stored at Global Fabrication Services, Inc.,
(together, the "Additional Loan Security").

3.2 Conditions The Bondholders' acceptance of the Proposal is conditional on the following: (a) all monies in the Escrow Account being moved to the Loan Trustee Account; and (b) unless otherwise agreed by the Loan

<<<

 Trustee (based on advice from Bingham that it is not
possible to take all or part of such security), the Additional Loan Security being granted in a form acceptable to the Loan Trustee (in consultation with Bingham). 3.3 Remedial's evaluation

<<<

 of the Proposal The Proposal would assist in enabling Remedial to make upcoming payments and meet continuing operating obligations up to the time of the EGM and (a) if the necessary EGM proposals and the Restructuring Proposal are approved

<<<

, for a short period thereafter to allow closing of the Restructuring Proposal, or (b) in the event that the necessary EGM proposals and/or the Restructuring Proposal are not approved, to allow Remedial to make arrangements with the Advisors

<<<

 for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders. If the necessary EGM proposals and the Restructuring Proposal are approved, Remedial would be in a fully financed position for approximately

<<<

 the next twelve months. It is important for the continuation of the operations of Remedial, pending approval and completion of the Restructuring Proposal, to be able to cover the costs of operations, general and administrative costs and other

<<<

 operational continuing obligations. It is Remedial's intention, in the event that the necessary EGM proposals and/or the Restructuring Proposal are not approved, to make arrangements with the Advisors for an organised wind-down of Remedial

's affairs in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders.

4. PROPOSAL FOR EXPENSES OF THE LOAN TRUSTEE
4.1 AMA
At the request of an ad hoc committee of Bondholders, the Loan Trustee

<<<

 initially approached AMA to represent the interests of the Bondholders with respect to a potential restructuring of the Bonds, and AMA has been working on this matter since August 2009 and was engaged through an engagement letter.
Remedial

<<<

 is supportive of the appointment of AMA as financial adviser to the Loan Trustee based on the information that the appointment was supported by more than 50 % of the Bondholders. Remedial has agreed to pay the monthly retainer and the success

<<<

 fee which would become due on completion of a Transaction (as defined below) to AMA (such fees being further detailed below). However, Remedial has not yet paid any such monthly retainer payable to AMA on account of its current cash position

<<<

.
In the event that the Proposal is approved, monies released from the Loan Trustee Account will enable Remedial to meet the monthly retainer fees and expenses of AMA. Furthermore, in the event that the Restructuring Proposal is subsequently

<<<

 approved, the monies in the Loan Trustee Account will be released to Remedial and Remedial will have sufficient liquidity to pay success fee amounts due to AMA.
However, in circumstances where the Restructuring Proposal is not so approved,

<<<

 Remedial will be unable to make payments due to AMA. It is accordingly proposed that the fees and expenses of AMA be met out of the Bondholders' cash recoveries, to the extent that the Restructuring Proposal does not obtain the requisite shareholder

<<<

 and Bondholder approval. AMA's engagement letter provides for payment of AMA's fees out of the Bondholders' cash recoveries subject to approval at a Bondholder meeting. Approval is therefore being sought from Bondholders that NTM be authorised

<<<

 to meet AMA's fees out of Bondholders' cash recoveries on the following basis.
Scope o f Work
AMA are providing financial advisory services to the Loan Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders). These services include conducting a business due diligence

<<<

 in relation to Remedial, and advising the Loan Trustee and assisting Bondholders in negotiations and discussions with Remedial and other stakeholders and commercial counterparties.
Monthly Retainer
AMA will be entitled to a monthly retainer

<<<

 of USD 60,000 per month for the term of the engagement, which will be for a minimum of two months, from the signing of the engagement letter.

Transaction Fees
If the Bond is restructured

<<<

 or redeemed in a manner which creates, or the Bondholders otherwise receive with respect to the Bond, a definitive recovery where the Recovered Amount (as defined below) is in excess of zero, then AMA will be entitled to receive a "Restructuring

<<<

 Fee" in accordance with the following table:

Recovered Amount (R)
0 - 40% 40% < R < 60% 60% < R <100%

Percentage Fee applicable to relevant proportion of
Recovered Amount
0.00%
1.50%
1.25%

"Recovered Amount" will mean the total amount of

<<<

 cash and the fair market value of the non cash consideration paid on the date of the closing of any transaction(s), including all securities and other property paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by an acquiring party, and shall also include

<<<

 any liabilities indirectly or directly assumed or acquired or otherwise repaid by the acquiring party in connection with or anticipation of the sale. In the event that any portion of the Recovered Amount is not delivered at closing, is subject

<<<

 to adjustment or is placed in escrow, the fee with respect to such portion of the Recovered Amount shall be paid to AMA if and when such consideration is received by the Bondholders.
AMA will also be entitled to reimbursement of its out of

<<<

 pocket expenses reasonably incurred in connection with providing its services.
It is proposed that the monthly retainer fees and out of pocket expenses of AMA be paid as a joint first priority out of amounts it receives for distribution to

<<<

 Bondholders (pro rata to the costs and expenses of the Loan Trustee) and before payment of any success fees payable to AMA and the distribution of those cash recoveries to the Bondholders It is further proposed that any success fee payable

<<<

 to AMA be paid as a second priority out of amounts it receives for distribution to Bondholders before the distribution of those cash recoveries to the Bondholders. This means that the AMA fees will effectively be shared amongst all of the Bondholders

<<<

.
AMA's engagement may be terminated on 5 days' notice by either party. The Restructuring Fee shall be payable in respect of a transaction consummated within 12 months of the termination date.
The Loan Trustee will also indemnity AMA in respect

<<<

 of all losses and liabilities it may incur as a result of the engagement. This indemnity will be capped at US$3 million and shall only be payable out of and to the extent of proceeds being received with respect to the relevant Bond issue. The

<<<

 indemnity will terminate 12 months after the date of the engagement letter, save in respect of accrued liabilities which have been notified in writing prior to that date by AMA.
4.2 Other expenses
The Loan Trustee is incurring fees, costs and

<<<

 expenses in its capacity as Loan Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders as a result of the restructuring discussions between Remedial and Bondholders. This includes legal expenses involved in the retention of Bingham by the Loan

6

N O R SK

 TILLITSM A N N ASA www.nustee.no

Trustee. However, as outlined above, Remedial has been unable to continue to meet these fees and expenses as a result of its lack of liquidity. As a consequence certain individual Bondholders have agreed to

<<<

 fund the fees of Bingham in the event that Remedial fails to make payment (the "Funding Bondholders").

As outlined above, in the event that the Proposal is approved, the monies released from the Loan Trustee Account will enable Remedial to

<<<

 meet the fees and expenses of the Loan Trustee (including legal expenses). Furthermore, in the event that the Restructuring Proposal is subsequently approved, the monies in the Loan Trustee Account will be released to Remedial and Remedial

<<<

 will have sufficient liquidity to settle the Loan Trustee's fees, costs and expenses (including legal expenses). However, if the Restructuring Proposal is not approved, Remedial will be unable to make such payments, and accordingly the Loan

<<<

 Trustee is seeking approval of payment of such amounts out of the Bondholders' cash recoveries in such circumstances.

It is therefore proposed that the Bondholders' meetings ratify and authorise the payment of the Loan Trustee's fees, costs

<<<

Remedial Releases 3rd Quarter 2009 Results - Discusses partial conversion of bond debt to equity with bondholder advisors
10 November 2009 - The Board of Directors of Remedial 

<<<

(Cyprus) Public Company Limited (`the Company') today approved the unaudited consolidated accounts for the 9 months ended 30 September 2009. See the "Financial Information" section in this release for details.
Revenues and Expenditures During

<<<

 the quarter, the Company received a payment in respect of a reimbursement of certain initial mobilization costs previously incurred and expensed with respect to the potential Chevron Thailand contract. The Company also recorded the sale of

<<<

 the large crane and mud pump, included in Owner Furnished Equipment held for sale, as revenue and the associated expenses as cost of sales. The crane was sold at carrying value (original cost less an allowance for sales commission), whereas

<<<

 the mud pump had to be sold at a discount to original cost. Certain other minor OFE held for sale items were written down to expected recovery value. The Company also incurred expenses for offshore personnel and administrative support. The

<<<

 third quarter result includes a $1.9 million debit relating to the change in the mark-to-market valuation of interest rate swaps.
Financing At 30 September 2009, the Company held $56.5 million of funds in escrow to cover future expenditure

<<<

 commitments for constructing and financing the first two vessels and $1.1 million of free cash to cover future operating costs and additional commitments in respect to the first two vessels.
At the end of October 2009, the cash position of

<<<

 the Company was $0.75 million in free cash and $56.5 million in escrow. The Company will require the free cash on hand and anticipated receipts from the sale of OFE concluded in the third quarter to be able to continue its operations through

<<<

 November 2009. The Company expects that the $2.3 million due will be received in part during November with the balance due in December 2009. Thereafter, the Company will require further proceeds from new OFE sales, the release of some of the

<<<

 escrow funds, or new equity or loans to support its immediate operations.
1

The Company's operating expenses are around $1 million a month, which will increase to around $2 million a month upon delivery of Remedial ESV Guardian. Without the

<<<

 benefit of customer contracts the Company estimates a forecast cash spend of approximately $70 million (excluding loan interest payments and deferred shipyard payments) to the end of October 2010 based upon forecast remaining gross capital

<<<

 expenditures of $43 million, overheads of $6m, vessel warm stack expenditures of $14 million and an allowance for mobilisation costs of $7 million. Depending on the timing and location of future contract awards the funding requirement may increase

<<<

 or decrease.
Due to the limited free cash available coupled with the current lack of firm contracts, latest vessel delivery schedules and potential requirements for mobilisation costs, the Company is working with its shareholders and bondholders

<<<

 on options to restructure its financing position and use the $56.5 million funds held in escrow for the most appropriate benefit to the Company. Agreement has been reached with each of COSCO and Yantai shipyards (in principle) that the Company

<<<

 may defer $7 million of the delivery payment in respect to each of Remedial ESV Solution and Remedial ESV Guardian for 12 months from delivery provided an acceptable security is provided to each shipyard. These deferred payments will fall due

<<<

 after the end of October 2010.
On 18th September 2009, the Company requested Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, as loan trustee, to summon a bondholders' meeting at which the bondholders would be requested to agree to a deferral of interest on the loan

<<<

 for a period of at least twelve months (to be capitalised to the principal amount of the loan at maturity date), the release of part of the funds in the escrow account for use for general corporate purposes and, in return, the Company would

<<<

 pay an additional amount to bondholders by way of a premium equal to 5% of the loan principal at maturity date.
On 1st October, upon request from the loan trustee, the Company agreed to defer the call for a bondholders' meeting to permit bondholders

<<<

 to consider and respond to the Company's proposed amendments to the Loan terms. On behalf of the bondholders, the loan trustee engaged a financial advisor (AMA Capital Partners LLC) and a legal adviser (Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP) to perform

<<<

 due diligence of the Company and give advice on the bondholders' position and the proposed amendments. On 30th September 2009, the Company was informed by the loan trustee that bondholders holding 52% of the loan support retention of these

<<<

 advisers.
The Company was advised by the representatives of the bondholders that the Company's initial proposal would not obtain the acceptance of the bondholders and the Company has ongoing discussions with the representatives in order to

<<<

 agree on a proposal to the bondholders meeting that is likely to be accepted.
2

An amended proposal has been received from the representatives of the bondholders which would result in a conversion of all indebtedness under the loan other

<<<

 than $56.5 million to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares representing 96 % of the post-restructuring share capital of the Company to the bondholders, a deferral of interest payments, and a release of the escrow monies for shipyard

<<<

 payments (as adjusted for the deferred payments) and general corporate purposes. In addition the proposal allows for an additional debt facility of $13.5 million to be secured against the vessels ranking on an equal basis to the remaining bond

<<<

 loan.
The Company has suggested certain amendments to the proposal from the representatives implying that the indebtedness under the loan other than $56.5 million shall be converted to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares to the

<<<

 bondholders representing 94% of the post-restructuring share capital based on an agreed equity value for this 94% of $55,575 million. The Company has further proposed to carry out a rights issue of shares for the aggregate gross subscription

<<<

 price of $20 million at a pre-money equity valuation of $58.5 million (after allowing for the $56.5 million bond loan, the additional $13.5 million of new debt and the $14 million of deferred shipyard payments) for 100% of the equity, for which

<<<

 the current shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe. Following such a rights issue, the bondholders would own approximately 70% of the enlarged share capital and 100% of the residual bond loan.
Either of proposals detailed above would place

<<<

 the Company in a fully financed position for approximately the next twelve months. As of today there is no agreement on either proposal.
The Company has not made the interest payment due 28 September 2009 of $3.1 million, as deferral of the

<<<

 interest payment is one of the proposals for amendment of the loan. The Company is therefore in technical default of the loan.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As explained in the liquidity position note

<<<

, the Group requires additional funds in order to complete delivery of its vessels and allow time for contracts for the vessels to be obtained and generate cash flow. As the refinancing proposals would place the Group in a fully financed position

<<<

 for approximately the next twelve months, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In the event that a refinancing is not successful the Group would be forced to sell assets in a distressed situation and the possible

<<<

 impacts of such sales on the Balance Sheet carrying value are discussed in the Potential Asset Impairment Note.
Market Update Most of the long term business opportunities being pursued by the Company have been deferred into 2010, although during

<<<

 the third quarter the Company did submit a tender for a four-year workover and well intervention contract which is due to commence in Q3 2010. The potential client has not yet
3

announced a decision regarding the tender. The Company has also

<<<

 provided indicative pricing to potential prospects in the windmill and accommodation markets during the third quarter.
During 2008, Remedial Offshore Limited (Remedial) was awarded a contract by Chevron Offshore (Thailand) Limited (Chevron

<<<

) to provide one of its ESVTM units for operations in the Gulf of Thailand. During Q1 2009 an Amendment to the Contract was signed which gives Chevron the right to designate the Contract commencement date by giving Remedial 90 days' advance

<<<

 written notice. As of the date of this report, no commencement date has been nominated by Chevron. If Chevron does not designate the commencement date on or before 1 March 2010 the Contract will automatically terminate without penalty.
Vessel

<<<

 Construction Update Latest photos of the ESV construction status can be seen at www.remedialoffshore.com.
COSCO: The Remedial ESV Solution under construction at COSCO Shipyards is nearing completion. During the 3rd quarter, the balance of the

<<<

 vessel's 425-foot legs was installed and fit-out of the accommodation block was completed. The shipyard are finishing a number of commissioning tasks as they prepare to complete electrical load tests, thruster installation and jacking trials

<<<

. The shipyard will then proceed with the sea trials before delivery. The Company anticipates Solution will be delivered before the end of the fourth quarter of 2009.
Yantai: The Remedial ESV Guardian under construction at Yantai Raffles Shipyard

<<<

 (YRS) was approximately 80% complete at 30 September 2009. During the third quarter the shipyard continued to work on installation of the large crane, piping and cabling systems and build-out of the accommodation block. During the fourth quarter

<<<

 the shipyard has installed the vessel's legs. The latest schedule from YRS forecasts Guardian to be delivered during the first quarter of 2010 but based upon current progress, delivery could be delayed further.
Work-Over Rigs: Construction

<<<

 of the two lift-off work over rigs is progressing and during the quarter the first rig was ready for testing of the top drive.
Owner-Furnished Equipment (OFE) held for sale: The Company had begun procuring long-lead materials and equipment

<<<

 for a potential third vessel. The key commitments involved leg material, thrusters, small cranes, a large crane, engines and generator sets. The Company has been marketing this equipment for sale and during the third quarter sold the large

<<<

 crane and mud pump.
4

Company Background The Company's principal activities are to build, own and operate purpose-built Elevating Support Vessels (ESVTM units), an innovative new class of self-propelled jack-up rig/vessel hybrids. Each ESV

<<<

 unit is designed to facilitate offshore well intervention activities and workover services for the oil and gas industry. The Company's proprietary ESV technology allows customers to enhance hydrocarbon production from mature wells and fields

<<<

. Vessel size and robust ESV design increase operating efficiency by providing a stable, efficient work environment. Well intervention and facility work benefit from higher utilisation levels (due to reduced sensitivity to weather conditions

<<<

), resulting in a lower per-well cost of intervention. Founded in 2006, Remedial Offshore (Remedial Cyprus PCL) is based in Limassol, Cyprus, and employs
engineering & procurement personnel in Houston, as well as operations personnel in the

<<<

 Bahamas and Thailand. Shares in Remedial Offshore are traded on the Oslo Axess n c n n exchange under the ticker code "ROFF". For more information, visit www.remedialoffshore.com.

 is located at 284 Arch Makariou III, Fortuna Court, Block B, 3rd Floor, Office 32, 3105 Limassol, Cyprus.
The Company's shares are traded on Oslo Axess under the ticker code "ROFF".

 effects.
This condensed consolidated interim financial information was authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on 10 November 2009.
This condensed consolidated interim financial information has not been audited.
Basis of Preparation

<<<

 This condensed consolidated interim financial information for the period ended 30 September 2009 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements

<<<

 for the year ended 31 December 2008, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies and computation methods applied are consistent with those of the annual financial

<<<

 statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 as described in those annual financial statements.
Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual earnings.
Various new

<<<

 standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009. The effect of those standards was not material for the condensed interim financial statements except for

<<<

:
· IAS 1 (revised), `Presentation of financial statements'. The revised standard prohibits presenting items of income and expenses (i.e., `non-owner changes in equity') in the statement of changes in equity, requiring `non-owner changes in

<<<

 equity' to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. All `non-owner changes in equity' are required to be shown in a performance statement.
Entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (statement of comprehensive

<<<

 income) or two statements (income statement and statement of comprehensive income).
The Group has elected to present one performance statement: the statement of comprehensive income. Interim financial statements have been prepared under the

<<<

 revised disclosure requirements.

Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited
Notes to the Condensed hterim Financial Information
Accounting Policies (Continued) At the date of the approval of these financial statements a number of accounting

<<<

 standards were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but were not yet effective, The effect of those standards is not expected to be material for the Group.
The functional currency of the Group is the US dollar.
The Going Concern

<<<

 Assumption The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As explained in the liquidity position note, the Group requires additional funds in order to complete delivery of its vessels and allow time for contracts for

<<<

 the vessels to be obtained and generate cash flow. As the refinancing proposals would place the Group in a fully financed position for approximately the next twelve months, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis

<<<

. In the event that a refinancing is not successful the Group would be forced to sell assets in a distressed situation and the possible impacts of such sales on the Balance Sheet carrying value are discussed in the Potential Asset Impairment

<<<

 Note.
Liquidity Position The Group is in the development phase. At 30 September 2009, the Company held $56.5 million of funds in escrow to cover future expenditure commitments for constructing and financing the first two vessels and $1.1 million

<<<

 of free cash to cover future operating costs and additional commitments in respect to the first two vessels.
At the end of October 2009, the cash position of the Company was $0.75 million in free cash and $56.5 million in escrow. The Company

<<<

 will require the free cash on hand and anticipated receipts from the sale of OFE concluded in the third quarter to be able to continue its operations through November 2009. The Company expects that the $2.3 million due will be received in part

<<<

 during November with the balance due in December 2009. Thereafter, the Company will require further proceeds from new OFE sales, the release of some of the escrow funds or new equity or loans to support its immediate operations.
The Company

<<<

's operating expenses are around $1 million a month, which will increase to around $2 million a month upon delivery of Remedial ESV Guardian. Without the benefit of customer contracts the Company estimates a forecast cash spend of approximately

<<<

 $70 million (excluding loan interest payments and deferred shipyard payments) to the end of October 2010 based upon forecast remaining gross capital expenditures of $43 million, overheads of $6 million, vessel warm stack expenditures of $1

<<<

4 million and an allowance for mobilisation costs of $7 million. Depending on the timing and location of future contract awards the funding requirement may increase or decrease.
Due to the limited free cash available coupled with the current

<<<

 lack of firm contracts, latest vessel delivery schedules and potential requirements for mobilisation costs, the Company is working with its shareholders and bondholders on options to restructure its financing position and use the $56.5 million

<<<

 funds held in escrow for the most appropriate benefit to the Company. Agreement has been reached with each of COSCO and Yantai (in principle), that the Company may defer $7 million of the delivery payment in respect to each of Remedial ESV

<<<

 Solution and Remedial ESV Guardian for 12 months from delivery provided an acceptable security is provided to each shipyard. These deferred payments will fall due after the end of October 2010.
On 18th September 2009, the Company requested

<<<

 Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, as loan trustee, to summon a bondholders' meeting at which the bondholders would be requested to agree to a deferral of interest on the loan for a period of at least twelve months (to be capitalised to the principal amount

 and a legal adviser (Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP) to perform due diligence of the Company and give advice on the bondholders' position and the proposed amendments. On 30thSeptember 2009, the Company has been informed by the loan trustee

 of interest payments, and a release of the escrow monies for shipyard payments (as adjusted for the deferred payments) and general corporate purposes. In addition the proposal allows for an additional debt facility of $13.5 million to be secured

<<<

 against the vessels ranking on an equal basis to the remaining bond loan.
The Company has suggested certain amendments to the proposal from the representatives implying that the indebtedness under the loan other than $56.5 million shall be

<<<

 converted to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares to the bondholders representing 94% of the post-restructuring share capital based on an agreed equity value for this 94% of $55,575 million. The Company has further proposed to

<<<

 carry out a rights issue of shares for the aggregate gross subscription price of $20 million at a pre-money equity valuation of $58.5 million (after allowing for the $56.5 million bond loan, the additional $13.5 million of new debt and the

<<<

 $14 million of deferred shipyard payments) for 100% of the equity, for which the current shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe. Following such a rights issue, the bondholders would own approximately 70% of the enlarged share capital and

<<<

 100% of the residual bond.
Either of proposals detailed above would place the Company in a fully financed position for approximately the next twelve months. As of today there is no agreement on either proposal.
The Company has not made the

<<<

 interest payment due 28 September 2009 of $3.1 million, as deferral of the interest payment is one of the proposals for amendment of the loan. The Company is therefore in technical default of the loan.
At 30 September 2009, the Group had cash

<<<

 and cash equivalents of $57.6 million (2008: $113.1 million) of which $1.1 million (2008: $21.4 million) related to cash available for general corporate purposes.
The $210 million bond is repayable in March 2012.

 Company Limited
Notes to the Condensed Interim Financial Information

Potential Asset Impairment In the event the Group is forced to sell off assets in a distressed situation, it is probable that assets would be sold for amounts significantly

<<<

 below their carrying value and certain commitments and contingent liabilities with a maximum value of less than $5m would crystallise. It is estimated the distressed sale price of the vessels under construction could result in an impairment

<<<

 charge of $150m and the sales proceeds would be insufficient to repay the loan secured by the bond. In addition to significant write downs on plant and equipment and OFE held for resale, the intangible assets and derivative financial assets

<<<

 of the Group would likely be fully impaired. In the event that the Group fails to secure client contracts at the rates currently tendered the carrying value of the assets could also be impaired.
Construction in Progress The Company has entered

<<<

 into agreements for construction of two ESVTM units and has purchased and supplied all the OFE for these ESV units. The agreements are with Yantai Raffles Shipyard Limited for Remedial ESV Guardian and with COSCO Nantong for Remedial ESV Solution

<<<

. Under the shipyard contracts the Company is obligated to make interim payments on achievement of progress or physical milestones.

Payments made against these milestones are recorded as construction in progress. The Company had also procured

<<<

 some OFE for a potential third ESV unit. During Q4 2008 management determined construction of a third ESV unit would not take place in the near future and, consequently, agreed to sell the OFE. The OFE was transferred from Construction in Progress

<<<

 and classified as OFE held for sale in the Balance Sheet.

Remedial Releases 3rd Quarter 2009 Results - Discusses partial conversion of bond debt to equity with bondholder advisors
1

<<<

0 Novem ber 2009 - The Board of Directors of Remedial (Cyprus) Public Com pany Limited (`the Com pany') today approved the unaudited consolidated accounts for the 9 months ended 30 Septem ber 2009. See the "Financial Information" section in

<<<

 this release for details.
Revenues and Expenditures During the quarter, the Com pany received a paym ent in respect of a reim bursem ent of certain initial mobilization costs previously incurred and expensed with respect to the potential Chevron

<<<

 Thailand contract. The Com pany also recorded the sale of the large crane and mud pump, included in O wner Furnished Equipment held for sale, as revenue and the associated expenses as cost of sales. The crane was sold at carrying value (original

<<<

 cost less an allowance for sales commission), whereas the mud pump had to be sold at a discount to original cost. Certain other minor OFE held for sale items were written down to expected recovery value. The Company also incurred expenses for

<<<

 offshore personnel and adm inistrative support. The third quarter result includes a $1.9 million debit relating to the change in the mark-to-market valuation of interest rate swaps.
Financing A t 30 Septem ber 2009, the Com pany held $56.5

<<<

 million of funds in escrow to cover future expenditure commitments for constructing and financing the first two vessels and $1.1 million of free cash to cover future operating costs and additional com m itm ents in respect to the first two

<<<

 vessels.
A t the end of O ctober 2009, the cash position of the Com pany was $0.75 million in free cash and $56.5 million in escrow. The Com pany will require the free cash on hand and anticipated receipts from the sale of OFE concluded in

<<<

 the third quarter to be able to continue its operations through Novem ber 2009. The Com pany expects that the $2.3 million due will be received in part during Novem ber with the balance due in Decem ber 2009. Thereafter, the Com pany will require

<<<

 further proceeds from new OFE sales, the release of som e of the escrow funds, or new equity or loans to support its immediate operations.
1

The Com pany's operating expenses are around $1 million a month, which will increase to around $

<<<

2 million a month upon delivery of Remedial E S V Guardian. W ithout the benefit of customer contracts the Company estimates a forecast cash spend of approximately $70 million (excluding loan interest payments and deferred shipyard payments

<<<

) to the end of October 2010 based upon forecast remaining gross capital expenditures of $43 million, overheads of $6m, vessel warm stack expenditures of $14 million and an allowance for mobilisation costs of $7 million. Depending on the timing

<<<

 and location of future contract awards the funding requirement may increase or decrease.
Due to the limited free cash available coupled with the current lack of firm contracts, latest vessel delivery schedules and potential requirem ents for

<<<

 mobilisation costs, the Com pany is working with its shareholders and bondholders on options to restructure its financing position and use the $56.5 million funds held in escrow for the most appropriate benefit to the Company. A greem ent has

<<<

 been reached with each of CO SCO and Yantai shipyards (in principle) that the Com pany may defer $7 million of the delivery paym ent in respect to each of R em edial E S V Solution and R em edial E S V Guardian for 12 months from delivery provided

<<<

 an acceptable security is provided to each shipyard. These deferred paym ents will fall due after the end of October 2010.
On 18th Septem ber 2009, the Com pany requested Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, as loan trustee, to sum m on a bondholders' meeting

<<<

 at which the bondholders would be requested to agree to a deferral of interest on the loan for a period of at least twelve m onths (to be capitalised to the principal am ount of the loan at maturity date), the release of part of the funds in

<<<

 the escrow account for use for general corporate purposes and, in return, the Com pany would pay an additional am ount to bondholders by w ay of a premium equal to 5% of the loan principal at maturity date.
On 1st October, upon request from

<<<

 the loan trustee, the Com pany agreed to defer the call for a bondholders' meeting to permit bondholders to consider and respond to the Company's proposed amendm ents to the Loan terms. On behalf of the bondholders, the loan trustee engaged

<<<

 a financial advisor (AMA Capital Partners LLC) and a legal adviser (Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP) to perform due diligence of the Company and give advice on the bondholders' position and the proposed amendments. On 30th Septem ber 2009, the

<<<

 Com pany was informed by the loan trustee that bondholders holding 52% of the loan support retention of these advisers.
The Company was advised by the representatives of the bondholders that the Com pany's initial proposal would not obtain

<<<

 the acceptance of the bondholders and the Company has ongoing discussions with the representatives in order to agree on a proposal to the bondholders meeting that is likely to be accepted.
2

An amended proposal has been received from the

<<<

 representatives of the bondholders which would result in a conversion of all indebtedness under the loan other than $56.5 million to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares representing 96 % of the post-restructuring share capital

<<<

 of the Company to the bondholders, a deferral of interest payments, and a release of the escrow monies for shipyard payments (as adjusted for the deferred payments) and general corporate purposes. In addition the proposal allows for an additional

<<<

 debt facility of $13.5 million to be secured against the vessels ranking on an equal basis to the remaining bond loan.
The Company has suggested certain amendments to the proposal from the representatives implying that the indebtedness under

<<<

 the loan other than $56.5 million shall be converted to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares to the bondholders representing 94% of the post-restructuring share capital based on an agreed equity value for this 94% of $55.575 million

<<<

. The Company has further proposed to carry out a rights issue of shares for the aggregate gross subscription price of $20 million at a pre-money equity valuation of $58.5 million (after allowing for the $56.5 million bond loan, the additional

<<<

 $13.5 million of new debt and the $14 million of deferred shipyard payments) for 100% of the equity, for which the current shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe. Following such a rights issue, the bondholders would own approxim ately

<<<

 70% of the enlarged share capital and 100% of the residual bond loan.
Either o f proposals detailed above would place the Com pany in a fully financed position for approxim ately the next twelve months. As of today there is no agreem ent on

<<<

 either proposal.
The Company has not made the interest paym ent due 28 Septem ber 2009 of $3.1 million, as deferral of the interest paym ent is one of the proposals for am endm ent of the loan. The Com pany is therefore in technical default

<<<

 of the loan.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As explained in the liquidity position note, the Group requires additional funds in order to complete delivery of its vessels and allow time for contracts for

<<<

 the vessels to be obtained and generate cash flow. As the refinancing proposals would place the Group in a fully financed position for approxim ately the next twelve months, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis

<<<

. In the event that a refinancing is not successful the Group would be forced to sell assets in a distressed situation and the possible impacts of such sales on the Balance Sheet carrying value are discussed in the Potential A sset Impairment

<<<

 Note.
Market Update Most of the long term business opportunities being pursued by the Com pany have been deferred into 2010, although during the third quarter the Com pany did subm it a tender for a four-year w orkover and well intervention

<<<

 contract which is due to com m ence in Q3 2010. The potential client has not yet
3

announced a decision regarding the tender. The Company has also provided indicative pricing to potential prospects in the windmill and accom m odation markets

<<<

 during the third quarter.
During 2008, Remedial Offshore Limited (Remedial) was awarded a contract by Chevron Offshore (Thailand) Limited (Chevron) to provide one of its ESVTM units for operations in the G ulf of Thailand. During Q1 2009 an

<<<

 Am endm ent to the Contract was signed which gives Chevron the right to designate the Contract commencement date by giving Remedial 90 days' advance written notice. As of the date of this report, no com m encem ent date has been nominated by

<<<

 Chevron. If Chevron does not designate the commencement date on or before 1 March 2010 the Contract will automatically terminate without penalty.
Vessel Construction Update Latest photos of the ESV construction status can be seen at www.rem

<<<

 edialoffshore.com.
COSCO: The R em edial E S V Solution under construction at COSCO Shipyards is nearing completion. During the 3rd quarter, the balance of the vessel's 425-foot legs was installed and fit-out of the accommodation block was

<<<

 completed. The shipyard are finishing a number of commissioning tasks as they prepare to com plete electrical load tests, thruster installation and jacking trials. The shipyard will then proceed with the sea trials before delivery. The Company

<<<

 anticipates Solution will be delivered before the end of the fourth quarter of 2009.
Yantai: The Rem edial E S V Guardian under construction at Yantai Raffles Shipyard (YRS) was approximately 80% complete at 30 September 2009. During the third

<<<

 quarter the shipyard continued to work on installation of the large crane, piping and cabling systems and build-out of the accommodation block. During the fourth quarter the shipyard has installed the vessel's legs. The latest schedule from

<<<

 YRS forecasts Guardian to be delivered during the first quarter of 2010 but based upon current progress, delivery could be delayed further.
W ork-Over Rigs: Construction of the two lift-off w ork over rigs is progressing and during the quarter

<<<

 the first rig was ready for testing of the top drive.
Owner-Furnished Equipment (OFE) held for sale: The Company had begun procuring long-lead materials and equipment for a potential third vessel. The key commitments involved leg material,

<<<

 thrusters, small cranes, a large crane, engines and generator sets. The Company has been marketing this equipment for sale and during the third quarter sold the large crane and mud pump.

Company Background The Company's principal activities

<<<

 are to build, own and operate purpose-built Elevating Support Vessels (ESVTM units), an innovative new class of self-propelled jack-up rig/vessel hybrids. Each ESV unit is designed to facilitate offshore well intervention activities and w orkover

<<<

 services for the oil and gas industry. The Company's proprietary ESV technology allows customers to enhance hydrocarbon production from mature wells and fields. Vessel size and robust ESV design increase operating efficiency by providing a

<<<

 stable, efficient work environment. Well intervention and facility work benefit from higher utilisation levels (due to reduced sensitivity to w eather conditions), resulting in a lower per-well cost of intervention. Founded in 2006, Remedial

<<<

 Offshore (Remedial Cyprus PCL) is based in Limassol, Cyprus, and employs
engineering & procurem ent personnel in Houston, as well as operations personnel in the Bahamas and Thailand. Shares in Remedial Offshore are traded on the Oslo Axess

Various new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory

 for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009. The effect of those standards was not material for the condensed interim financial statem ents except for:
· IAS 1 (revised), `Presentation of financial statem ents'. The revised

 standard prohibits presenting items o f incom e and expenses (i.e., `non-ow ner changes in equity') in the statem ent o f changes in equity, requiring `non-ow ner changes in equity' to be presented separately from ow ner changes in equity.

 All `non-ow ner changes in equity' are required to be shown in a perform ance statement.
Entities can choose w hether to present one performance statem ent (statem ent of comprehensive income) or two statements (income statem ent and statem

The Group has elected to present one performance statement: the statement of comprehensive income. Interim financial statements have been prepared under the revised disclosure requirements.

Accounting Policies (Continued) A t the date of the approval of these financial statements a number of accounting standards were issued by the International Accounting

<<<

 Standards Board but w ere not yet effective. The effect o f those standards is not expected to be material for the Group.
The functional currency of the Group is the US dollar.
The Going Concern Assumption The financial statements have been

<<<

 prepared on a going concern basis. As explained in the liquidity position note, the Group requires additional funds in order to com plete delivery of its vessels and allow tim e for contracts for the vessels to be obtained and generate cash

<<<

 flow. As the refinancing proposals would place the Group in a fully financed position for approxim ately the next twelve months, the financial statem ents have been prepared on a going concern basis. In the event that a refinancing is not successful

<<<

 the Group would be forced to sell assets in a distressed situation and the possible impacts of such sales on the Balance Sheet carrying value are discussed in the Potential A sset Im pairm ent Note.
Liquidity Position The Group is in the developm

<<<

 ent phase. A t 30 Septem ber 2009, the Com pany held $56.5 million of funds in escrow to cover future expenditure com m itm ents for constructing and financing the first two vessels and $1.1 million of free cash to cover future operating costs

<<<

 and additional com m itm ents in respect to the first two vessels.
A t the end of O ctober 2009, the cash position of the Com pany was $0.75 million in free cash and $56.5 million in escrow. The Com pany will require the free cash on hand and

<<<

 anticipated receipts from the sale of OFE concluded in the third quarter to be able to continue its operations through Novem ber 2009. The Com pany expects that the $2.3 million due will be received in part during Novem ber with the balance

<<<

 due in December 2009. Thereafter, the Company will require further proceeds from new OFE sales, the release of some of the escrow funds or new equity or loans to support its immediate operations.
The Com pany's operating expenses are around

<<<

 $1 million a month, which will increase to around $2 million a month upon delivery of Remedial E S V Guardian. W ithout the benefit of customer contracts the Company estimates a forecast cash spend of approxim ately $70 million (excluding loan

<<<

 interest payments and deferred shipyard payments) to the end of October 2010 based upon forecast remaining gross capital expenditures of $43 million, overheads of $6 million, vessel warm stack expenditures of $14 million and an allowance for

<<<

 mobilisation costs of $7 million. Depending on the timing and location of future contract awards the funding requirement may increase or decrease.
Due to the limited free cash available coupled with the current lack of firm contracts, latest

<<<

 vessel delivery schedules and potential requirem ents for mobilisation costs, the Com pany is working with its shareholders and bondholders on options to restructure its financing position and use the $56.5 million funds held in escrow for

<<<

 the most appropriate benefit to the Company. Agreement has been reached with each of COSCO and Yantai (in principle), that the Com pany may defer $7 million of the delivery paym ent in respect to each of Rem edial E S V Solution and R em edial

<<<

 E S V Guardian for 12 months from delivery provided an acceptable security is provided to each shipyard. These deferred payments will fall due after the end of October 2010.
On 18th Septem ber 2009, the Com pany requested Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA, as loan trustee, to sum m on a bondholders' meeting at which the bondholders would be requested to agree to a deferral of interest on the loan for a period of at least twelve months (to be capitalised to the principal am ount of the loan

<<<

 at maturity date), the release of part of the funds in the escrow account for use for general corporate purposes and in return the Company would pay an additional amount to the bondholders by way of a premium equal to 5% of the loan principal

<<<

 at maturity date. On 1st October, upon request from the loan trustee, the Com pany agreed

Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited
Notes to the Condensed Interim Financial Information
Liquidity Position (continued) to defer the call for

<<<

 a bondholders' meeting to permit bondholders to consider and respond to the Company's proposed amendm ents to the Loan terms. On behalf o f the bondholders, the loan trustee engaged a financial advisor (AMA Capital Partners LLC) and a legal

<<<

 adviser (Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP) to perform due diligence of the Company and give advice on the bondholders' position and the proposed amendments. On 30th Septem ber 2009, the Com pany has been informed by the loan trustee that bondholders

<<<

 holding 52% of the loan support retention of these advisers.
The Company was advised by the representatives of the bondholders that the Com pany's initial proposal would not obtain the acceptance of the bondholders and the Company has ongoing

<<<

 discussions with the representatives in order to agree on a proposal to the bondholders meeting that is likely to be accepted.
Recently an amended proposal has been received from the representatives of the bondholders which would result in

<<<

 a conversion of all indebtedness under the loan other than $56.5 million to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares representing 96 % of the post-restructuring share capital of the Company to the bondholders, a deferral of interest

<<<

 payments, and a release of the escrow monies for shipyard paym ents (as adjusted for the deferred payments) and general corporate purposes. In addition the proposal allows for an additional debt facility of $13.5 million to be secured against

<<<

 the vessels ranking on an equal basis to the remaining bond loan.
The Company has suggested certain amendments to the proposal from the representatives implying that the indebtedness under the loan other than $56.5 million shall be converted

<<<

 to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares to the bondholders representing 94% of the post-restructuring share capital based on an agreed equity value for this 94% of $55.575 million. The Company has further proposed to carry out

<<<

 a rights issue of shares for the aggregate gross subscription price of $20 million at a pre-money equity valuation of $58.5 million (after allowing for the $56.5 million bond loan, the additional $13.5 million of new debt and the $14 million

<<<

 of deferred shipyard payments) for 100% of the equity, for which the current shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe. Following such a rights issue, the bondholders would own approximately 70% of the enlarged share capital and 100% of the

<<<

 residual bond.
Either o f proposals detailed above would place the Com pany in a fully financed position for approxim ately the next twelve months. As of today there is no agreem ent on either proposal.
The Company has not made the interest

<<<

 paym ent due 28 Septem ber 2009 of $3.1 million, as deferral of the interest paym ent is one of the proposals for am endm ent of the loan. The Com pany is therefore in technical default of the loan.
A t 30 September 2009, the Group had cash

<<<

 and cash equivalents of $57.6 million (2008: $113.1 million) of which $1.1 million (2008: $21.4 million) related to cash available for general corporate purposes.
The $210 million bond is repayable in March 2012.

Notes to the Condensed Interim Financial Information

Potential Asset Impairment In the event the Group is forced to sell off assets in a distressed situation, it is probable that assets would be sold for amounts significantly

<<<

 below their carrying value and certain commitments and contingent liabilities with a maximum value o f less than $5m would crystallise. It is estimated the distressed sale price of the vessels under construction could result in an im pairm

<<<

 ent charge of $150m and the sales proceeds would be insufficient to repay the loan secured by the bond. In addition to significant write downs on plant and equipment and OFE held for resale, the intangible assets and derivative financial assets

<<<

 of the Group would likely be fully impaired. In the event that the Group fails to secure client contracts at the rates currently tendered the carrying value of the assets could also be impaired.

Construction in Progress The Company has entered

<<<

 into agreements for construction of two ESVTM units and has purchased and supplied all the OFE for these ESV units. The agreem ents are with Yantai Raffles Shipyard Limited for Remedial E S V Guardian and with COSCO Nantong for Rem edial E

Paym ents made against these milestones are recorded as construction in progress. The Com pany

 had also procured som e OFE for a potential third ESV unit. During Q4 2008 m anagem ent determ ined construction o f a third ESV unit would not take place in the near future and, consequently, agreed to sell the OFE. The OFE was transferred
