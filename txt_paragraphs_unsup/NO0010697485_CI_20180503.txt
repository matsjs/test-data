Quarterly report For the period ended March 31,2018
Aoka Mizu heading to the berth

Results and main developments for the three months ended March 31, 2018
First quarter results The net result after tax for the first quarter

<<<

 of 2018 amounted to a profit of U.S.$11.1 million compared to a loss of U.S.$9.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was U.S.$53.9 million compared to U.S.$31.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.

<<<

 The financial results for the first quarter of 2018 were mainly impacted by the following items:
The SPM division generated U.S.$19.0 million EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 compared to U.S.$1.9 million EBITDA for the first quarter of 

<<<

2017. In 2018, mainly one large EPC project contributes to the SPM EBITDA while in 2017 the progress on the running SPM projects were either in design or in final stages, resulting in lower EBITDA.
The EBITDA for the FPSO division in the first

<<<

 quarter of 2018 amounted to U.S.$32.8 million compared to U.S.$32.1 million EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017. The U.S.$0.7 million increase in EBITDA compared to the first quarter of 2017 was mainly driven by a U.S.$0.8 million increase

<<<

 in EBITDA for the FPSO Aoka Mizu. During the first quarter of 2017 the vessel was in lay-up while during the first quarter of 2018 the vessel was under construction. EBITDA for the FPSO Haewene Brim increased by U.S.$0.6 million compared to

<<<

 the first quarter of 2017. This increase was caused by lower credits on the lease in 2018 compared to 2017 following high availability of the FPSO during the reporting period. This increases in EBITDA are for a large part offset by the decrease

<<<

 in EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm of U.S.$0.9 million due to lower tariff income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Finally FPSO tender costs in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by U.S.$0.2 million, despite

<<<

 the increase in number of tender prospects in 2018.
During the first quarter of 2018, unallocated income amounted to U.S.$2.0 million, compared to U.S.$2.4 million unallocated expenses for the first quarter of 2017. The portion unallocated

<<<

 expenses in 2018 was U.S.$0.7 million lower than in same period of 2017 mainly as a result of lower professional services costs. In the first quarter of 2018 the overhead recovery improved U.S.$3.7 million compared to the first quarter of 

<<<

2017, which was driven by higher project activity and higher utilisation of engineering and project management staff.
Depreciation and amortization expenditure in the first quarter of 2018 amounted to U.S.$26.7 million compared to U.S.$ 27.

<<<

3 million for the first quarter of 2017. This U.S.$0.6 million decrease in depreciation costs was mainly caused by lower depreciation costs of FPSO Haewene Brim. The Topsides of FPSO Haewene Brim have been fully depreciated.
Finance expenses

<<<

 were U.S.$1.7 million higher compared to the previous year, at U.S.$15.6 million versus U.S.$13.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. This increase in finance expenses was mainly driven by the Hurricane overrun finance facility expenses

<<<

 of U.S.$1.5 million and the increased bond expenses of U.S.$1.8 million in connection with the Hurricane project. In the third quarter of 2017 an amount of U.S.$4.7 million was added to the debt arrangement fees. These arrangement fees consist

<<<

 of legal, advisory, professional, upfront and commission fees and costs incurred to get in place the overrun finance facility for the Hurricane project of which U.S.$1.2 million was amortized in the first quarter of 2018. Apart from the debt

<<<

 arrangement fees the commitment fee for the first quarter of 2018 was U.S.$0.3 million. The bond interest costs increased with U.S.$1.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017 as a result of quiet enjoyment

<<<

 in favour of Hurricane of the Aoka Mizu needed to ensure the Hurricane contract. This increase in bond interest is added to the bond value as payment in kind interest. Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$1.5 million compared to the previous

<<<

 year, mainly due to further reduction of net debt.
Currency exchange results were U.S.$1.1 million negative in the first quarter of 2018 compared to nil in the first quarter of 2017. The significant decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar

<<<

 against the Euro and Pound Sterling has led to negative exchange results in the first quarter of 2018. The currency exchange rate moved from EUR/USD
2

1.20 and GBP/USD 1.35 at the beginning of the year to EUR/USD 1.23 and GBP/USD 1.41 at

<<<

 the end of the first quarter of 2018. Because the Company's revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollar and a part of the expenses are in EUR and GBP, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Only part

<<<

 of the currency exposure is hedged by the Company. Income tax benefit for the first quarter of 2018 amounted U.S.$0.2 million versus U.S.$0.1 million income tax expenses for the first quarter of 2017. The U.S.$0.2 million income tax benefit

<<<

 in 2018 relates to the reversal of a withholding tax accrual in Angola. The U.S.$0.1 million income tax expense in 2017 relates mainly to withholding tax incurred in relation to SPM revenues. Other developments The revolving credit facility

<<<

 that was scheduled to mature on March 31,2018 has been extended till December 31,2018. Ancillary to this revolving credit facility a bank guarantee facility is made available to the Company for a maximum amount of U.S.$10.0 million.

General

<<<

 information Aurelia Energy N.V. (``the Company'') is the holding company of the Bluewater group (Bluewater), a specialized service provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates floating

<<<

 production storage and offloading units (``FPSOs''), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops, performs project management and constructs single point mooring systems (``SPMs''). An FPSO is a type of floating

<<<

 production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either newly built or converted tankers upon which production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and water) are

<<<

 processed on board the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported to an off take system utilizing shuttle tankers. Bluewater's fleet of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling

<<<

 phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- and long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts. SPMs are used to transfer fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or

<<<

 shuttle tanker while securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. Most SPMs consist of an anchoring system that is connected to the ocean floor and a fluid transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids between fixed and rotating

<<<

 parts of the mooring system. SPMs are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors. Revenues are earned from day rates consisting of a fixed facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases

<<<

 with oil companies, supplemented from time to time with fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services

<<<

 that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed. FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial design and engineering phase to final installation. Further, Bluewater engages subcontractors in the fabrication

<<<

 of FPSOs, SPMs and auxiliary equipment.

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Reporting entity Aurelia Energy

<<<

 N.V. (``the Company'') has its legal seat in Willemstad (Curasao). The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the period ended March 31,2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together

<<<

 referred to as ``the Group'' or ``Bluewater'' and individually as ``Group entities'') and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities.
Statement of compliance The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been

<<<

 prepared using accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements.
Basis of preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements

<<<

 are presented in thousands of US dollars, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been

<<<

 prepared using accounting policies consistent with the recognition and measurement criteria of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements. The information furnished in the

<<<

 unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of such financial statements. Although

<<<

 the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial

<<<

 statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31,2017.
The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application

<<<

 of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates

<<<

 are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant

<<<

 effect on the amounts recognised in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are:
 Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful

<<<

 life and future revenues earned with the FPSOs, which along with
the discount rate, is the basis for the recoverable amounts of FPSOs;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forward;  Potential impact of claims and litigation

1. Segment information
The disclosure of segment information is consistent with the internal reports in order to assess each segment's performance and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments

<<<

 since the Company's risks and rates of return are affected primarily by differences in services and products produced.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated

<<<

 on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly employee benefits expense, head office expenses, investments and related revenue and income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues
