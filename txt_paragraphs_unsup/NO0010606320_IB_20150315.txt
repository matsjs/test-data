RECORD DATES FOR DISTRIBUTIONS IN RELATION TO THE RESTRUCTURING
Reference is made to the summons to Bondholders' Meetings in the above mentioned Bonds dated 16 February 2015 (the "Summons"). Defined terms used herein

<<<

 shall have the same meaning as given to them in the Summons.
The record dates for the distributions as described below will be end of business 17 March 2015 (the "Record Date"). The last trading date for the Bonds was 13 March 2015. Trades

<<<

 after this date will not be settled before the Record Date. The distributions include settlement of all accrued interest and default interest to 5 March 2015. All distributions will be made pro rata to the Bondholders within each respective

<<<

 Bond as of the Record Date. Settlement is expected to be on or about 20 March 2015.
As part of the restructuring Noreco will issue new shares with a temporary ISIN (NO 001 0732928) (the "New Shares") that will be registered and tradable on

<<<

 the Norwegian OTC list ("N-OTC"). Upon approval of a listing prospectus for the New Shares they will become listed on Oslo Stock Exchange ("OSE") under the same ISIN and ticker code as the currently outstanding Noreco shares. Registration on

<<<

 N-OTC is expected on or about 23 March 2015 and listing on OSE is expected ultimo April 2015.
Note that following the non-payment of the respective coupons on 9 December 2014, the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) has registered

<<<

 a separate claim (the "Coupon Claim") that can be traded independently of the principal claim ("Principal Claim") in the Norwegian market. Settlement of trades in the Norwegian market will by default not include the Coupon Claim unless it is

<<<

 manually transferred account-to-account. Hence, buyers of the principal claim since the ex coupon date, 25 November 2014, ("Ex Coupon Date") may not receive the distributions related to the Coupon Claim. To our knowledge, custodians, such as

<<<

 Euroclear and Clearstream, does not support such detached Coupon Claims and will trade the Principal Claim and Coupon Claim together. Any disputes with respect to the distributions need to be settled between the parties of the transaction agreement

<<<

 assisted by the broker of the transaction.
