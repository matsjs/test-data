Introduction and Background

1.1

Subsequent bond issue

On 20 December 2012, the Company issued Bonds in an aggregate Nominal Amount of SEK 500,000,000, within a framework amount of SEK 750,000,000, in accordance with

<<<

 the Terms and Conditions. According to Section 2.4 of the of the Terms and Conditions, the Company may choose to issue the remaining amount of Bonds (i.e. Bonds in an aggregate Nominal Amount of SEK 250,000,000) at one or more subsequent dates

<<<

1.2

Background and key financial information

A description of the background to and motives for the proposed Resolution (as defined below) is available in the Company's presentation attached hereto as Appendix 1. This

<<<

 Section 1.2 contains a summary of the key financial information provided therein.

As of 31 December 2013, the Company's cash balance amounted to SEK 236 million, the gross debt excluding leases amounted to SEK 500 million and the leases,

<<<

 which after a change in the Company's accounting principles has been reclassified from operational to financial, amounted to SEK 121 million. For the financial year 2013, the Company's EBITDA amounted to SEK 155 million, including SEK 72 million

<<<

 in restructuring costs related to the merger with Karelia Upofloor Oy. For the same period, the adjusted EBITDA excluding one-offs amounted to SEK 227 million, the gross debt including leases amounted to SEK 621 million and the net debt including

<<<

 leases amounted to SEK 385 million, which implies a gross leverage of 2.7x and a net leverage of 1.7x.

With the integration of Karelia Upofloor Oy completed, the Company targets a net leverage of 3.0-3.5x. For this purpose, the Company has

<<<

<<<

 amount of SEK 350 million. These transactions imply a pro forma gross debt, including leases, amounting to SEK 846 million. Assuming that Bonds in the subsequent bond issue will be issued at 107 per cent of the Nominal Amount, that a consent

<<<

 fee of SEK 25 million will be payable in connection with the Holders' consent and that the transaction costs will amount to SEK 2.75 million, the pro forma cash balance will amount to SEK 99 million and the net debt, including leases, will

<<<

 amount to SEK 747 million, whereas the pro forma gross leverage will be 3.7x and the pro forma net leverage will be 3.3x.
