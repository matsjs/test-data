Point Resources AS In brief

A platform for further growth established

On 1 November 2017, Point Resources AS took over as operator of the assets acquired from ExxonMobil, and I had privilege to take on the

<<<

 position as CEO, heading what constitutes the start of the next generation of operating companies on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The first step on this road is to develop Point Resources into a leading, independent exploration and

<<<

 production (E&P) company, and the Company's achievements during 2017 prove that we are well under way to establishing a robust platform for further expansion.

Point Resources ambition is to achieve a production level of more than 150 000 boepd

<<<

 by the mid-2020s. Our game plan to achieve this ambitious objective, is underpinned by five core strategic activities; to increase recoverable reserves from our producing assets and grow production through new major developments, as well as

<<<

 selective exploration, portfolio optimisations and further M&A activities.
A vital component to realising our ambitious production targets, is a competent organisation, with a shared set of values and unwavering focus. Our current organisation

<<<

 is the result of the successful combination of Point Resources' entrepreneurial spirit and ExxonMobil's industry leading organisation from more than 50 years of NCS operations. Our goal is to integrate and optimise these two complimentary cultures

<<<

 and continue to develop Point Resources into an organisation that is renowned and respected for industry leadership.
In our approach to triple our production level by the mid of the next decade, we need to be in the forefront in key areas.

<<<

 Health, safety, security and the environment (HSSE) is not only a priority, but also a core value in all our operations and at every level of the organ isation. I was pleased to see the two merged Point Resources organisations add to the Company

<<<

's strength in this area in 2017, and we will continue to improve these efforts.
Looking back at 2017, it was a year of major events and suc cesses, of which the transfer of operatorships and ownerships from ExxonMobil to Point Resources was

<<<

 a key element. This transaction added growth and positioned Point Resources as a key player, ready to partake in shaping the NCS E&P business going forward. A few months into 2018, backed by highly reputed owners, with a track record for building

<<<

 leading E&P companies, and a strong organisation, we succeeded in raising and securing a USD 250 million bond, by targeting leading international investors. I take this as proof of faith in our ability to develop Point Resources into a leading

<<<

 next generation E&P operator on the NCS.
That said, I also know from experience that what creates value in a successful E&P company is safe, high quality, day-by-day operations, and the ability to realise value in the existing portfolio. I

<<<

 am proud to say that we accomplished several of our ambitions

in these areas during 2017, thereby consolidating our position for the future.
During the year, Point Resources participated in several Plans for Development and Operations - such

<<<

 as the Bauge field, the Fenja field and the Snorre Expansion Project - which were all submitted to the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. We also completed successful exploration activities, resulting in the Frosk discovery in early

<<<

 2018, and have put solid efforts into maturing commercial discoveries such as Garantiana and Brasse. All in all, Point Resources has gained experience and created value by focusing on fast track, low cost, subsea developments that fully utilise

<<<

 existing infrastructure.
In addition, we are making major investments in our operated Balder and Ringhorne fields in the North Sea. More than half a cen tury after ExxonMobil was awarded the very first production licence (PL 001) here in 1

<<<

965, resulting in the first Norwegian oil discovery two years later, it is quite remarkable that we still find further potential in the area. Point Resources has sanctioned a new 6-well infill drilling campaign at Ringhorne, with drilling starting

<<<

 1Q 2019. A major future drilling program at Balder is also being matured, supported by a new seismic survey, to be acquired in 2018. A new exploration campaign, to be executed in the Balder and Ringhorne area in 2019, has also been approved

<<<

. These activities, along with facility life extension programmes, will significantly increase oil recovery at our operated assets.
Furthermore, Point Resources invested significantly in the Awards for Predefined Areas (APA), and was awarded

<<<

 a total of ten licences in early 2018, whereof two licences as operator. We see this as recognition of the competence and hard work of our organisation.
2017 was an eventful year, which started Point Resources on the journey to becoming an

<<<

 active player in shaping the further devel opment of the NCS. As CEO, I see an exciting potential for growth - both organically and through strategic M&A initiatives. We have in place two vital components to carry this out, in the form of a

<<<

 reputable and financially solid key owner, and an organisation set up with skilled, experienced professionals.

The CEO of Point Resources AS, Morten Mauritzen, at the Ringhorne field after the transfer of operatorships

<<<

 from ExxonMobil to Point Resources 1 November 2017.

The acquisition of the fields Balder, Ringhorne and Ringhorne East has turned Point Resources into an operator and an independent mid-sized Norwegian E&P company with a full-cycle licence

 portfolio.

After 36 years in ExxonMobil, I now look forward to applying my experience to help Point Resources attain the goals set for the Company, and most of all, I look forward to solving new challenges together with our dedicated and highly

<<<

-skilled organisation. The activities we are planning in Norway's oldest licence area symbolise the potential still present on the NCS. PL 001 is far from an industry sunset.
We are excited about this journey and look forward to 2018.

Point Resources AS From the Board room

Board of Directors' report 2017

Point Resources AS has an ambition to

<<<

 become a leading, independent E&P company on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).

In 2017, Point Resources reached several important milestones towards achieving this goal. ExxonMobil's operated producing assets on the NCS were combined

<<<

 with Point Resources' portfolio, to create a pure-play NCS independent E&P company with a full-cycle portfolio. Point Resources is well positioned to become a leading player on the NCS.

Point Resources AS ("Point Resources", the "Group", or

<<<

 the "Company") has identified five core strategic activities; maximise value from production, mature key developments, portfolio optimisation, selective exploration, and growth through mergers and acquisitions (M&A). These activities will continue

<<<

 to be of vital importance over the next years, to be able to realise the Company's ambitions and create value for stakeholders.
Point Resources delivered on all five core strategic activities in 2017. In November, the Company successfully closed

<<<

 the ExxonMobil transaction, which was an important milestone. The transaction included the transfer of a diverse and multi-disciplined organisation. The new and integrated organisation enables the Company to efficiently develop its strategic

<<<

 position, building on ExxonMobil's heritage of operation since 1965. The transfer of operatorship and integration process went according to plan, securing a significant production level and a robust foundation for further development of the

<<<

 Company.
In 2017, Point Resources took several important steps to continue future production growth. For the Bauge field (PL 348), a Plan for Development and Operations (PDO) was submitted in March, and the licence received approval from the

<<<

 Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) in June. In December, PDOs related to the develop ment of the Fenja field (PL 586) and the Snorre Expansion Project (PL 057 and PL 089) were submitted to the Ministry.
Using a selective approach to exploration

<<<

, Point Resources has targeted near-field opportunities in core areas, to utilise existing infrastructure. The strategy has resulted in several commercial discoveries which will be candidates for fast-track and low-cost subsea developments.

<<<

 The Frosk discovery near the Bøyla field, discovered in February 2018, is one of the low-cost subsea devel opment candidates. Commercial discoveries, such as Garantiana and Brasse, have been matured further towards field development during

<<<

 the year. Point Resources invested significant resources in the Awards in Predefined Areas 2017 (APA) licence application round. The awards were announced in January 2018, and Point Resources was granted ten licences, including two operatorships

<<<

, thereby adding significant acreage in the Company's core areas.
With the acquisition of ExxonMobil's producing assets Balder, Ringhorne, and Ringhorne Øst, Point Resources completed one of

the largest transactions on the NCS during the year

<<<

. Mergers and acquisitions, as well as portfolio optimisation initiatives, are pivotal to the future development of Point Resources. The Company is well positioned and will actively pursue M&A and portfolio optimisation opportunities.
Going

<<<

 into 2018, Point Resources has a robust balance sheet with a strong liquidity position and a diversified debt funding mix. The Company adheres to a conservative and active risk management policy with hedging and insurance cover to protect against

<<<

 poten tial downsides. Cash flow from the producing fields will enable investments in further growth over the coming years. Maintaining financial flexibility is a prioritised task for the Company.
The Company has identified additional growth

<<<

 potential in the current production portfolio, and has several projects under development. By 2022, Point Resources targets a total production level of more than 90 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from the current portfolio.
Corporate

2017 financial highlights
· The Company's Reserve-Based Lending (RBL) facility was successfully refinanced with a syndicate of 12 Nordic and international banks

<<<

, bringing size of the total facility to USD 700 million, with an accordion of USD 350 million. At year-end, USD 542 million was drawn on the RBL facility
· The Group has a solid cash position at year-end (USD 123 million), and an additional

<<<

 accessible borrowing facility from Point Resources Holding AS of USD 159 million
· Revenues increased from USD 94 million in 2016 to USD 192 million in 2017. The increase is largely attributed to the two months of production from the assets

<<<

 acquired in the ExxonMobil transaction
· The cost per barrel (including amortisation and depreciation) decreased from USD 40.4 to USD 30.2
· EBIT ended at USD -31 million, against USD -126 million in 2016 · If the starting date for the business

<<<

 combination was 1 January
2017, the Group would have had revenues of USD 812 million and EBIT at USD 221 million
Production
In March 2017, ExxonMobil and Point Resources signed a sales and purchase agreement for the acquisition of the ExxonMobiloperated

<<<

 fields Balder, Ringhorne, Ringhorne Øst, Jotun and Forseti on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).
The agreement included ExxonMobil's heritage of a half-century of operation through its organisation, offshore installations, and offices at

<<<

 Forus. Approximately 300 former ExxonMobil employees were transferred to Point Resources on 1 November as part of the transaction.

Total daily net production in 2017 taking into account full-year production from the acquired assets was 46

<<<

 492 barrels of oil equivalent, whereof 43 131 originated from the operated fields, and 3 360 originated from the Company's partner-operated portfolio.

Development
In 2017, Point Resources participated in the submission of three PDOs to the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum

 and Energy (MPE).
In March, the licencees in PL 348 submitted the PDO for the Bauge field in the Norwegian Sea to the MPE. Bauge is a subsea develop ment, from which oil and gas will be transported to the Njord field installations for processing

<<<

. The Company has an ownership interest of 17.5 percent, and the start of production is planned for 2020. In June, the MPE approved the Bauge PDO, together with an updated Njord PDO. Reserves at Bauge are estimated to be 73 million boe.
In December

<<<

, the licencees in PL 586 submitted the PDO for the Fenja field to the MPE. Recoverable Fenja reserves are estimated to be 100 million boe, and Point Resources has the largest ownership interest, with 45 percent. The start of production is planned

<<<

 for early 2021.
Two days after submission of the Fenja PDO, the licencees in the Snorre field submitted an updated plan for development and operation to the MPE. The project, in which Point Resources has an ownership interest of 1.1 percent

<<<

, is substantial and will create value for the owners for decades. The Snorre Expansion Project will extend the field's life to 2040 and beyond and will increase the field's recovery rate from 47 to 51 percent.
Exploration

awarded in the APA

<<<

 2017. The Company will also work on the appli cation for new licences in the APA 2018. A key activity is preparation for the drilling of two exploration wells in the Company-operated area on the Utsira High, near the Balder and Ringhorne fields

<<<

. According to the current plan, drilling operations will take place in 2019. In addition, the Hornet prospect in PL 777 in the North Sea is being prepared for exploration drilling in the second half of 2018.
Consolidated financial results for

<<<

 the year
On 1 November 2017, the Group acquired ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisition is recorded in the 2017 financial statements as a business combination,

<<<

 and for account ing purposes the income statement reflects the acquired operation from 1 November 2017. The unaudited pro-forma statements include revenues and costs for the full year. For balance sheet impacts from the acquisition, see note

<<<

 2.1 Business combinations.
Changes in accounting methods
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group elected to change methods of accounting revenues from production of oil and gas, from the entitlement method to the sales method. The change

<<<

During 2017, the Company participated in the drilling of two explora tion wells and one successful appraisal

<<<

 well. The latest exploration well on the Frosk prospect in PL 340 in the North Sea was spudded on 29 December and completed in February 2018. This well, together with two side-tracks, proved an oil discovery with signifi cantly larger reserves

<<<

 than the pre-drill estimates. Point Resources holds a 20 percent ownership share in the Frosk discovery.

Consolidated statements of income
The Group's income from the sale of crude oil, gas and NGL in 2017 was USD 192.3 million, compared with

<<<

 USD 94.0 million in 2016. The year-over-year increase in petroleum revenues comes as a result of the acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway, as well as of higher oil prices realised in 2017.

Exploration activities

<<<

 in 2018 will focus on maturing prospects in existing licences and identifying new drilling prospects in licences

Total volumes sold in 2017 amounted to 3.373 million boe, at a realised average price per boe of USD 57.01. In 2016, the volume

produced was 2.352 million boe, at a realised average price per boe of USD 39.98. The operational figures are affected by the change from the entitlement method to

<<<

 the sales method.
Production cost (direct production cost, tariffs and transportation, direct production tax and other production costs) amounted to USD 44.8 million in 2017. The corresponding production cost for 2016 was USD 33.7 million.

<<<

 The production cost increase is mainly driven by the acquisition of the Balder, Ringhorne and Ringhorne Øst fields.
An increase in oil prices resulted in a loss from hedging activities on Brent Crude put options. This loss was the main contributor

<<<

 to a cost increase of USD 54.3 million in general & administrative (G&A) and other income and expenses, including hedging activities, when compared to 2016.
Full-year EBITDAX was USD 94.0 million, an increase of USD 32.9 million, when compared

<<<

 to 2016.
Net financial items amounted to USD -25.4 million in 2017, against USD -22.8 million in 2016. The increase in finance cost resulted from a combination of higher interest cost and refinancing costs following an increase in the Reserve

<<<

-Based Lending Facility from USD 150 million to USD 700 million, and accretion expenses (asset retirement obligation).
Profit before net profit interest and income taxes for the period was USD -56.8 million, an increase of USD 92.5 million over

<<<

 2016 (USD -149.3 million).
For a breakdown of income taxes, reference is made to note 6.1 in the consolidated financial statements. According to statutory requirements, the tax calculations have to be performed in NOK, which may have significant

<<<

 impact on the effective tax rate, as the financial statements have been presented in USD.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenue would have been USD 812 million, and the profit before tax for the period would

<<<

 have been USD 109 million. Reference is made to note 2.1 for further details.
Consolidated statements of financial position
Total assets at year-end 2017 were USD 2 853.2 million. The corresponding figure for 2016 was USD 670.5 million. The

<<<

 increase in total assets mainly relates to the acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway.
Goodwill increased by USD 548.1 million, of which USD 467.2 million is technical goodwill. The value of oil and gas properties

<<<

 increased by USD 1 227.9 million, and non-current and current receivables increased by USD 275.3 million, which mainly relates to the compensation of decommissioning costs for Jotun B from ExxonMobil as part of the transaction.
Cash and short

<<<

-term deposits increased by USD 46.3 million from 2016. The Group's total liabilities were USD 2 598.8 million, compared with USD 448.9 million in 2016. The increase in total liabilities is due to the financing of the acquisition of ExxonMobil

<<<

's operated upstream in Norway, where non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings, loans from related companies, and current interest-bearing loans and borrowings increased by USD 854.3 million. The Group has also taken over the asset

<<<

 removal obligation related to the acquired fields, and the total current and non-current abandonment provision has increased from USD 91.9 million in 2016 to USD 1 063.0 million in 2017.

Other long-term liabilities and other current liabilities

<<<

 increased by USD 91.6 million and USD 30.4 million, respectively. The increases are related to deferred payments, contingent consideration, and financial lease commitments.
Other current financial liabilities increased by USD 32.5 million,

<<<

 and relates to hedging activities on Brent Crude put options.
Deferred tax liabilities increased by USD 109.5 million and is signif icantly influenced by the after-tax transaction with ExxonMobil, in accordance with § 10 of the Norwegian Petroleum

<<<

 Taxation Act.
Total equity increased by USD 32.9 million to USD 254.5 million, comprising new share capital issued during the year and total comprehensive income for the period. At year-end, the equity ratio was 8.9 percent of total assets

<<<

.
Consolidated cash flow statements
Cash flow from operating activities was USD 130.5 million (2016: USD 71.5 million), which is substantially higher than the operating profit. The bulk of the difference relates to tax refund and depreciation

<<<

 of property, plant and equipment. The significant increase in cash flow generated from operating activities is also due to a combination of higher production following the acquisition of the Balder and Ringhorne fields, and higher realised

<<<

 oil prices than in the previous year.
The net cash flow used in investing activities amounted to USD 749.2 million, up from USD 11.3 million in the preceding year. The increase in investing activities was mainly related to the ExxonMobil transaction

<<<

.
The net cash flow from financing activities amounted to USD 665.1 million, up from USD -41.1 million in 2016. The 2017 investments were financed through a combination of refinancing of the RBL facility, new equity from funds managed by HitecVision

<<<

, group loans, and cash flow from operations.
The Company's cash position at year-end 2017 was USD 123.1 million, an increase of USD 46.4 million over year-end 2016.
Point Resources AS (Parent Company); annual results and allocation
Profit for

<<<

 the year 2017 for Point Resources AS was USD -33.9 million. The Board of Directors proposes that the profit for the year is transferred to other equity.
Financial risk
Point Resources' financial results are dependent on several factors, of

<<<

 which fluctuations in commodity prices and the NOK/ USD exchange rates are the most significant. As experienced in 2017, shifting commodity prices and foreign exchange rates can have significant impact on financial results. Revenues are mainly

<<<

 denominated in USD, while a significant amount of operating expenses and income taxes accrue in NOK. Revenues are directly affected by the oil price, and the Group has partly mitigated this risk by entering into hedge structures related to

<<<

 the oil price. Derivatives are categorised as held for trading in the financial state ment, as the Group does not apply hedge accounting. For further details, please refer to note 4.5 in the financial statements.

Risk management and internal control
Point Resources is exposed to a variety of risks associated with oil and gas operations. Effective risk management is key to meeting the Company's strategic business objectives, but the

<<<

 main risk concern is the health and safety of employees and contractors.

<<<

 system, and accepted standards for operations and risk management for the oil and gas industry. The management system shall support safe and efficient management of business activities and risk, and ensure that strategies and business objectives

<<<

 are met in alignment with laws, regulations and guidelines. To ensure learning and improvement, the systems and processes are subject to continuous evaluation.

The Company's business activities have the potential to affect the external environment

<<<

, and emphasis is placed on the importance of understanding factors that pose risk to the environment. Point Resources' environmental programme is fully integrated with the planning process and execution of all activities in production, development

<<<

, and exploration. Emissions to air and discharges to sea in 2017 were within the permitted limits and were reported to the authorities in accordance with regulations.
The Company's management system, the Point Resources Management System (PRMS

<<<

), plays a vital role in equipping the workforce with the necessary framework to conduct operations in a safe, environmentally responsible, and ethically sound manner. The system was subject to a significant update to include processes for safe

 operations of the Balder, Ringhorne and Jotun assets prior to the transfer of operatorship and ownership interests of these assets.
Work environment

Section 1 Background information

1.1. Corporate information

The consolidated financial statements of Point Resources AS and its subsidiaries (collectively, "the Group", "the Company" or "Point Resources") for the year ended 3

<<<

1 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a Board resolution on 27 April 2018. Point Resources AS is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Norway and the Company's shares are privately held. The Group's

<<<

 head office is located at Grenseveien 6, 4313 Sandnes, Norway.
Point Resources is a mid-sized, independent exploration and production (E&P) company with a diverse portfolio of production, development and exploration assets on the Norwegian

<<<

 Continental Shelf (NCS).

On 1 November 2017, Point Resources AS acquired ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisition included a transfer of the majority of ExxonMobil

<<<

's offshore and onshore E&P staff in Norway; a significant package of operated producing assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; field assets such as platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs); as well as the

<<<

 Company's office building in Sandnes. More detailed information is included in note 2.1.

Accounting policy - Basis of consolidation Control is deemed to exist when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over

<<<

 the investee. Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary

<<<

. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consol idated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary

<<<

.

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income ("OCI") are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions

<<<

 between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

Point Resources AS Financial Statements

1.2 Basis for preparation

The Group's financial statements consist of consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated

<<<

 statements of financial position, consolidated statements of cash flow, consol idated statements of changes in equity and related notes. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accord ance with International Financial Reporting

<<<

 Standards (IFRS) as adopted by The European Union (EU).
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. Further, the financial statements

<<<

 are prepared based on the going concern assumption.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD and

all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (000), except when otherwise indicated. The parent company's functional currency

<<<

 is NOK. The Group has chosen to present its financial statements in USD, as this a commonly used presentation currency among oil and gas companies.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group's entities at their respective

<<<

 functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. For presentation purposes, balance sheet items are translated from functional currency to presentation currency by using spot rates of exchange at the

<<<

 reporting date. Items within total comprehensive income are translated from functional currency to presentation currency by use of average exchange rates for each month.

1.3. General accounting principles

Significant accounting judgements

<<<

, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, the accompanying disclosures

<<<

 and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affecting future periods. The Group

<<<

 bases its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements are

prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that

<<<

 are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions as they occur.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimating uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of

<<<

 causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are listed below and are also discussed in the individual notes of the related financial statement line items.

Current versus non-current classification The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statements of financial position based on a current/non-current classification.
An asset is current when

<<<

 it is: · Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in
the normal operating cycle · Held primarily for the purpose of trading · Expected realised within twelve months after the reporting period · Cash or cash equivalent unless

<<<

 restricted from being exchanged
or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
a liability is current when: · It is expected to be settled in the normal operating

<<<

 cycle · It is held primarily for the purpose of trading

· It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period · There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the
liability for at least twelve months after the

<<<

 reporting period
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition,

<<<

 construc tion or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. Borrowing costs are only capitalized during the

<<<

 development phase. Qualifying assets are generally those that are subject to major development or construction projects. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other

<<<

 costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

1.4. Changes in accounting principles and disclosures

Recognition of revenue from production of oil and gas In conjunction

<<<

 with the business combination, the Group re-as sessed its accounting principle for recognition of revenue from production of oil and gas. The Group previously recognised all rev enues based on its net working interest (the entitlement method

<<<

). Lifting imbalances, which represents the difference between lifted volumes and the Group's share of produced volumes, was presented as current assets or current liabilities. Such assets and liabilities were initially recognised and subsequently

<<<

 measured at net realisable value.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group decided to change the method of accounting for revenues from production of oil and gas in which the Group has an interest to align Point Resources and the acquired

<<<

 business from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. In addition, current standards do not regulate lifting imbalances, and in practice, entities use either the

sales method or the entitlements method. Under the new standard for

<<<

 recognition of revenue, IFRS 15, the entitlement method is not expected to be in scope as revenue as determined under IFRS 15 only can arise from transactions with customers, and the overlifter will probably not be considered as a customer

<<<

.
As of 2017 the Group has recognised revenue based on the actual lifted amount of production (sales method) and will record a lifting imbalance when actual sales/lifted amount differ from the share of production. Such assets and liabilities

<<<

 are initially recognised and subsequently measured to production cost. If the market price is lower than production cost an underlift asset would be measured to current market value.
The effect of changing accounting policy to the sales method

<<<

 has been analysed and summarized in the table below:

USD 1 000 1 JANUARY 2016
Equity Tax liability Underlift (asset)

159 (understated) 579 (understated) 738 (understated)

1 JANUARY 2017
Equity Tax liability Overlift (liability)

196 (understated

<<<

) 717 (understated) 913 (overstated)

The total effect for comparative periods is considered to be immate rial for the financial statement and the change in accounting policies has not been applied retrospectively for comparative periods.
For

<<<

 more details on the revenue recognition accounting policy, refer to note 2.3.
New and amended standards and interpretations The Group applied for the first time certain amendments to the IFRSs, which are effective for annual periods beginning

<<<

 on or after 1 January 2017. The Group has not early adopted any standards,

interpretations or amendments that have been issued, but are not yet effective. The nature and the impact of each amendment is described below:
Amendments to IAS 7

<<<

 Statement of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative The amendments require entities to provide disclosure of changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes (such

<<<

 as foreign exchange gains or losses). The Group has provided the information for the current period in note 5.6.

1.5. Standards and amendments issued but not yet effective

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective

<<<

 up to the date of issuance of the Group's financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.
The IASB has issued three new standards that are particularly relevant

<<<

 for the Group, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases.
Based on its current sales contracts and a to a limited extent financial instruments, the Group does not expect significant effects

<<<

 from IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 with respect to recognition and meas urement. The Group does however expect to prepare additional disclosures on revenue from contracts with customers and financial instruments when the standards become effective. The

<<<

 Group may choose to implement hedge accounting when adopting IFRS 9, however, the effects of such a change will rather be a result of new application of accounting principles than an isolated effect

from IFRS 9, as the Group has not chosen

<<<

 to implement hedge accounting under current IFRS regime (IAS 39).
The Group has assessed the revenue recognition accounting policy in 2017 and changed from the entitlement method to the sales method, see note 1.4.
The effects from implementing

<<<

 IFRS 16 will be assessed during 2018. The Company expects that it will have to recognise several leases on their balance sheet that will result in:
· Annual lease expenses recognised as operational expenses under IAS 17 will impact the EBITDA

<<<

 positively
· Annual depreciation of leased assets will increase and affect EBITDA positively.
In addition the Group has to prepare additional disclosure information as required.

Point Resources AS Financial Statements

53

Below are the new

<<<

 standards described in more detail:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 is effective for

<<<

 annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required, but providing comparative information is not compul sory. For hedge accounting, the requirements

<<<

 are generally applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. During 2016 and 2017, the Group performed a highlevel impact assessment of IFRS 9. This preliminary

<<<

 assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further detailed analyses or additional rea sonable and supportable information being made available to Point Resources in the future. Overall

<<<

, the Group expects no significant impact of IFRS 9, except from different disclosures being required.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising

<<<

 from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard

<<<

 will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted

<<<

. The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date using the full retrospective method.
During 2017, the Group performed a more detailed analysis of IFRS 15 and have elected to change revenue recognition accounting pol

<<<

 icy to the sales method. Based on information currently available, the Group expects no significant impact from IFRS 15, except for additional disclosures being required under the new standard.

Lessees will also be required to remeasure the

<<<

 lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g., a change in the lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally recognise the

<<<

 amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
IFRS 16 also requires more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17.
The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January

<<<

 2019. Early application is permitted, but not before an entity applies IFRS 15. A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospec tive approach. The Group plans to assess the potential effects

<<<

 of IFRS 16 on its financial statements in 2018, however, it is likely that several of its lease agreements, need to be recognised on the balance sheet.
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration The interpretation covers

<<<

 foreign currency transactions when an entity recognises a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration before the entity recognises the related asset, expense or income. It clarifies

<<<

 that in determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income, the date of the transaction is the date on which an entity initially recognises the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising

<<<

 from the advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the entity must determine a date of the transac tions for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. IFRIC 22 is effective for annual periods

<<<

 beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Entities may apply the amendments on a fully retrospective basis. Alternatively, an entity may apply the interpretation prospectively to all assets, expenses and income

<<<

 in its scope that are initially recognised on or after the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the interpretation, or the beginning of a prior reporting period presented as comparative information.

IFRS 16 Leases

<<<

 IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases and its interpretations, including IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation

<<<

 and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard includes two recogni tion exemptions for lessees - leases

<<<

 of 'low-value' assets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term leases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). At the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability

<<<

) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense

<<<

 on the right-of-use asset.

Section 2 Operating performance

2.1. Business combinations

Accounting policy - Business combinations A business combination is a transaction or other event in which

<<<

 an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Determining whether a particular set of assets and activities is a business

<<<

 should be based on whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as consideration

<<<

 transferred representing acquisition date fair value. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in

<<<

 general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed).
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured

<<<

 at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit

<<<

 from the combination, irre spective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway On 1 November, 2017, the Group acquired ExxonMobil's operated

<<<

 upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisition included a transfer of the majority of ExxonMobil's offshore and onshore E&P staff in Norway; a significant package of operated producing assets

<<<



(Balder, Ringhorne, Ringhorne Øst and Jotun) on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; field assets such as platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs); as well as the Company's office building in Sandnes.
The business

<<<

 was acquired by and combined with Point Resources AS to create a strong, new mid-sized Norwegian E&P company. With an asset portfolio that includes several fields in the develop ment phase, the combined Company has the potential to grow its

<<<

 production base organically to over 90 000 boepd by 2022, and has proven and probable reserves and contingent resources of about 369 million barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2017.
As part of the transaction the Group acquired 100 percent

<<<

 of the shares in in Standard Marine Nordsjø AS and in ExxonMobil Property Norway (2) AS. In addition, the Group acquired the remaining 5 percent of the interest in PR Jotun DA.
Standard Marine Nordsjø AS later changed name to Point Resources

<<<

 FPSO AS. Shares in Point Resources FSPO AS and PR Jotun DA were incorporated in the new company Point Resources FPSO Holding AS.
The shares in ExxonMobil Property Norway (2) AS (later changed name to Grenseveien 6 AS) were sold to ABP Holdco

<<<

 AS immedi ately after the aqcuisition and the Group entered a lease agree ment with the new owner. For more information on the transaction see note 4.3 and 4.4.
The transaction with ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS is recorded

<<<

 as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. The acquisition date for accounting purposes corre sponds to the completion date of the transaction on 1 November 2017. For tax and economic purposes, the effective date was 1 January 20

Contingent consideration As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner, the following contingent considerations have been agreed:
a) An annual contingent consideration the following 5 years if the yearly

 22.9 million.

b) A fixed amount and an additional amount per barrel of oil equivalent, that exceeds a threshold of oil equivalents, if the Group utilize their option to develop the Forseti structure. As at the acquisition date, the fair value

According to § 10 in the Norwegian Petroleum Tax Act transaction shall be done after tax and the buyer is

 therefore not entitled to claim tax deduction for the part of consideration that exceeds the tax position acquired from the seller. Provision for deferred tax is made for the difference between acquisition cost and acquired tax base in accordance

<<<

 with IAS 12. Offsetting entry of this non-cash deferred tax is technical goodwill.
The remaining goodwill of USD 80.6 million comprises the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition and assembled workforce, which is not separately

 recognised. Goodwill is allocated entirely to operations on the the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The valuation is based on currently available information

<<<

 on fair values as of the acquisition date. If new information becomes available within 12 months from the acquisition date, the Group may change the fair value assessment in the purchase price allocation, in accordance with guidance in IFRS

· Calculated interest income from the mandatory deposit as per the SPA
· Calculated expected reduction in General and Administration expenses (G&A) related

2.2. Segment information

<<<



Accounting policy - Segment information Since the establishment of Point Resources in May 2016, its operations have been fully focused on exploration and production of petroleum on NCS, which is also the level used by executive management

<<<

 in monitoring the operating results for the purpose of making decisions.
The Group's activities are considered to have a homogeneous risk and return profile (same geographical area and activities). Hence, all of Point Resources's activities

<<<

 are focused within one single

operation segment (NCS). Segment figures are therefore similar to the income statements.
Significant customers In 2017 and 2016 revenues from sale of oil and gas to ExxonMobil, Statoil and Shell each amounted

<<<

 to more than 10 percent of total revenues. Total revenues from those customers were USD 131.7 million, USD 35.3 million (2016: USD 42.7 million) and USD 21.0 million (2016: USD 51.8 million) respectively.

2.3. Revenues and other income

Accounting

<<<

 policy - Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is received. Point Resources has

<<<

 concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements since it is the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements, has pricing latitude, and is also exposed to over- and underlift and credit risks.
Revenues from production

<<<

 of oil and gas Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods pro vided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.

production

<<<

 cost, an underlift asset would be measured to current market value if the lifting imbalance will be settled by future lifting. Imbalances which are expected to be settled in cash are to be measured at net realisable value.
The Group has changed

<<<

 accounting principle for recognising revenues from production of oil and gas from assets in which the Group has an interest, from the Group's net working interest (the entitlement method) to the sales method for the year ended 31 December 

<<<

2017. See more information in note 1.4.
Rendering of services Revenues from sales of services are recorded when the services are performed.

Revenues from production of oil and gas in which the Group has an interest is recognised based on the

<<<

 Group's actual lifted amount of production (the sales method). The Group records an overlift lia bility when actual sales/lifted amount exceeds the Group's share of actual production in the period. Similarly, the Group would record an underlift

<<<

 asset when share of production exceeds actual lifted volumes. The over- or underlift is adjusted to production costs.

Gains from put options Realised and unrealised gains from put options used for hedging oil price are presented as other income

<<<

 and expenses including results from hedging activities.
Reference to note 5.1 and 5.2 for accounting principles concerning treatment and purpose of options.

Section 3 Asset base

3.1. Exploration and evaluation assets

Accounting policy - Exploration, evaluation and development

<<<

 expenditure Exploration, evaluation and development expenditures are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
(i) Pre-licence costs Pre-licence costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
(ii) Licence

<<<

 and property acquisition costs Exploration licence and property acquisition costs are capitalised as intangible assets. Licence costs paid in connection with a right to explore in an existing exploration area are capitalised in intangible assets

<<<

.
Licence and acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way

<<<

 or firmly planned, or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and that sufficient progress is being made on establishing

<<<

 development plans and timing.

When exploration efforts lead to commercial discoveries and internal approval for development is sanctioned, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil and gas properties. If no future activity is planned

<<<

 or the licence has been relinquished or has expired, the carrying value of the licence and property acquisition costs are written off through the statement of comprehensive income.
(iii) Exploration and evaluation costs Exploration and evaluation

<<<

 activity involves the search for hydro carbon resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.
Once the legal right to explore has been acquired, costs directly associated

<<<

 with an exploration well are capitalised as exploration and evaluation intangible assets until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include directly attributable employee remuneration, materials

<<<

 and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors.
Geological and geophysical costs are expensed as exploration costs through the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.

There was no significant reclassification to the statement of comprehensive income during 2017.
If no potentially commercial hydrocarbons

<<<

 are discovered, the exploration asset is written off through the statements of com prehensive income as a dry hole. If extractable hydrocarbons are found and are subject to further appraisal activity (e.g., the drilling of additional wells

<<<

), it is probable that they can be commercially developed and the costs are capitalised. The costs continue to be carried as an intangible asset while sufficient/continued progress is made in assessing the commerciality of the hydrocarbons.

<<<

 Costs directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons

<<<

 were not found, are initially capitalised as an intangible asset.
All such capitalised costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review, as well as review for indicators of impairment at least once a year. This is to confirm

<<<

 the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery. When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off through the statement of comprehensive income.
When proved reserves of oil are determined and development

<<<

 is sanctioned by management, the relevant capitalised expenditure is first assessed for impairment and (if required) any impairment

loss is recognised, then the remaining balance is transferred to oil and gas properties. Other than for licence

<<<

 costs, no amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.
For exchanges/swaps or parts of exchanges/swaps that involve only exploration and evaluation assets, the exchange is accounted for at the carrying value of the asset

<<<

 given up and no gain or loss is recognised.
(iv) Farm -outs -- in th e exploration and evaluation phase The Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee on its account. It neither recognise any gain or loss on its exploration and

<<<

 evaluation farm-out arrangements, but re-designates any costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained. Any cash consideration received directly from the farmee is credited against

<<<

 costs previously capi talised in relation to the whole interest with any excess accounted for by the farmor as a gain on disposal.
(v) Development costs Expenditures on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities

<<<

 such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, including unsuccessful development or delineation wells, are capitalised within oil and gas properties.

Point Resources AS Financial Statements

Significant judgements

<<<

, estimates and assumptions The application of the Group's accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement to determine whether future economic benefits are likely, from either future exploitation or sale, or

<<<

 whether activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. The determination of reserves and resources is itself an estimation process that involves varying degrees of uncertainty depending

<<<

 on how the resources are classified. These estimates directly impact when the Group defers exploration and evaluation

expenditure. The deferral policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events and circumstances

<<<

, in particular, whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after expenditure is capitalised, information becomes available

<<<

 suggesting that the recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount is written off in the statement of comprehensive income in the period when the new information becomes available.

3.2. Oil and gas properties

Accounting

<<<

 policy - Oil and gas properties (i) Initial recognition Oil and gas properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost

<<<

, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation and, for qualifying assets (where relevant), borrowing costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate

<<<

 amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. The capitalised value of a finance lease is also included within property, plant and equipment.
When a development project moves into the production phase

<<<

, the capitalisation of certain construction/ development costs ceases, and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to oil and gas property asset additions

<<<

, improvements or new developments.
(ii) Depreciation/amortisation Oil and gas properties are depreciated/amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total proved developed, proved undeveloped

and probable reserves expected to be recovered

<<<

 from the relevant fields. The depletion rate takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated future capital expenditures.
The estimated reserves, asset's residual values and methods of depreciation/amortisation are

<<<

 reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Jotun FPSO A is depreciated over the lease period which ends 30 June 2020.
(iii) Major maintenance, inspection and repairs Where an asset, or part of an asset that was separately

<<<

 depreci ated and is now written off is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group, the expenditure is capitalised. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programmes

<<<

 are capitalised and amortised over the period to the next inspection. All other day-to-day repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Accounting

<<<

 policy - Impairment losses (non-financial assets excluding goodwill) The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) may be impaired. Management has assessed its CGU's as

<<<

 being an individual field, which is the lowest level for which cash inflows are largely independent of those of other assets. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset

<<<

's or CGU's recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and value in use (VIU). The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate

<<<

 cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which case the asset is tested as part of a larger CGU to which it belongs. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount

<<<

, the asset/CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

In calculating VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of

<<<

 the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset/CGU. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated

<<<

.
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognised in the statements of comprehensive income.
For assets/CGUs excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether

<<<

 there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset

<<<

's/CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited

Estimates and assumptions

<<<

 The useful life of each asset, which is assessed at least annually, has both physical life limitations and present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the field at which the asset is located. These calculations require the use

<<<

 of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves, decommissioning costs, discount rate, exchange rates and estimates of future capital expenditure.
Future estimated cash flow for assets or CGU's Changes in expected

<<<

 cash flow associated with asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) may result in an impairment of the carrying amount of individual assets to estimated recoverable value. Impairment assessments require long-term assumptions regarding economic factors

<<<

, oil price, the Group's long-term oil price assumptions, oil production, exchange rates, discount rates, cost estimates (capex and opex) and residual value of assets.
Total proved developed, proved undeveloped and probable reserves Annual estimates

<<<

 of oil and gas reserves and resources are generated internally by the Group's reservoir engineers. Standard recognised evaluation techniques are used to estimate the proved and probable reserves and the contingent resources based on quantities

<<<

 of crude oil, natural gas and economic and operational conditions. The estimates are based on prices from today's market, with the exception of already contractual price changes. Changes in proved developed, proved undeveloped and probable

<<<

 reserves could arise due to changes in the factors or assumptions used in estimating reserves, including commodity prices and future capital expenditure. An independent reserves auditor reviews the reserve estimates annually and results are

<<<

 reported to the Board along with an externally generated Reserves Audit Report.
Changes in future oil prices and future capital expenditure estimates can change reserves estimates, and hence the time when fields become unprofitable, which affects

<<<

 the time of shutdown and decommissioning activities. For more information on decommissioning cost see note 4.2.

Discount rate The Group's discount rate is derived from the Group's post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC

<<<

 takes into account both the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group's investors. The cost of debt is based on interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment

<<<

 specific risk is incor porated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.
Cost profiles Cost profiles used in the calculation of value in use are based on operator budgets

<<<

 and general market assessments done by the Group's facility and operations engineers. Cost profiles consists of operating expenses and capital expenditures. Operating expenses comprises variable elements such as processing tariffs, pipeline

<<<

 tariffs, and lease rates and fixed elements such as platform costs and operator overheads. Capital expenditures can relate to investments made to develop a field, or to already producing fields to maintain/ increase production or prolong the

<<<

 field life.
Impairments The Group has not recognised any impairments of oil and gas properties in 2016 or 2017.
Value in use is calculated by discounting future cash flows after tax. Below is an overview of key assumptions used in the impair

<<<

 ment tests as at 31 December 2017.
Economic assumptions The Group uses available market information to regularly assess the short- and long-term outlook for commodity prices. Assumptions regarding commodity prices are continually reviewed and

<<<

 updated by management. According to the above method ology the Group has used the following future quality adjusted oil prices and forward exchange rates in the calculation of the recoverable amount for oil and gas properties.

Unit-of-production

<<<

 rate of depreciation/amortisation The calculation of the unit-of-production rate of depreciation/ amortisation will be impacted by revision of proven and probable reserves and and future capital expenditure estimate changes.

3.4. Goodwill and other intangible assets

Accounting policy - Other intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill Goodwill arises principally because of the following factors:
· The ability to capture

<<<

 unique synergies that can be realised from managing a portfolio of both acquired and existing fields
· The requirement to recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities for the difference between the assigned values and the tax bases of assets

<<<

 acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at amounts that do not reflect fair value (more information in note 2.1)

Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recog nition at cost

<<<

. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets with definite lives are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation (generally

<<<

 depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives) and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Indefinite lived intangibles are not amortised, instead they are tested for impairment at least annually. Internally generated

<<<

 intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs and E&E assets, are not capitalised. Instead, the

Point Resources AS Financial Statements

related expenditure is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period

<<<

 in which the expenditure is incurred.
In relation to the acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway, seismic and other technical data of USD 34.9 million was capitalized as other intangible assets. Seismic data was related

<<<

 to the Balder, Ringhorne and Forseti fields. If the Group's busi ness activity in the area ceases, the seismic is impaired immediately.

Impairment testing of goodwill For impairment testing purposes, all acquired goodwill has been allocated to

<<<

 the Group's assets on the NCS.
Accounting policy - Impairment losses goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Impairment is deter mined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or group

<<<

 of CGU's to which the good will relates. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount of the asset including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in

<<<

 future periods. For more information on accounting policies, estimates and assumptions see note 3.2.
When assessing impairment of technical goodwill, recognised deferred tax related to a business combination (see more infor mation in note 

<<<

2.1) will reduce net book value before impairment assessment. Going forward depreciation of excess values from the acquisition analysis will lead to a reduction in deferred tax liability, hence more technical goodwill will be exposed to impairment

<<<

.

Impairment testing ordinary goodwill Goodwill of USD 95.7 million has been allocated to the Group's operations on the the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation

<<<

 as described above and outlined in note 3.2. As a result of the analysis, no impairment was required for this CGU.

 items and provisions

4.1. Provisions for other liabilities

Accounting policy - Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow

<<<

 of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an

<<<

 insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement

<<<

. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due

<<<

 to the passage of time is recognised as part of finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.

Other provisions Other provisions comprise provision on a total of USD 12 million where USD 9 million is payable 1 January 2019 and USD

<<<

 3 million is payable 1 January 2020. The provision relates to decommis sioning costs on the Athena field in connection with former Spike Exploration AS' sale of Spike UK to Verus Petroleum Holding Limited.

4.2. Decommissioning

<<<

 provision

Accounting policy - Provisions Equivalent to provisions for other liabilities, see note 4.1.
Accounting policy - Decommissioning provision The obligation generally arises when the asset is installed or the ground/environment is altered

<<<

 at the field location. When the liability is initially recognised, the present value of the estimated

costs is capitalised by increasing the carrying amount of the related oil and gas assets.
Changes in the estimated timing or cost of decommissioning

<<<

 are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to oil and gas assets.

Point Resources AS Financial Statements

69

Any reduction in the decommissioning liability and, therefore, any

<<<

 deduction from the asset to which it relates, may not exceed the carrying amount of that asset. If it does, any excess over the carrying value is taken immediately to the statement of compre hensive income.

Over time, the discounted liability

<<<

 is increased for the change in present value based on the discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability. The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the statement of comprehensive

<<<

 income as a finance cost.

If the change in an estimate results in an increase in the decom missioning liability and, therefore, an addition to the carrying value of the asset, the Group considers whether this is an indication of impairment

<<<

 of the asset as a whole, and if so, tests for impairment. If, for mature fields, the estimate for the revised value of oil and gas assets net of decommissioning provisions exceeds the recoverable value, that portion of the increase is charged

<<<

 directly to expense.

Decommissioning provision The Group makes full provision for the future cost of decom missioning oil production facilities on a discounted basis on the installation of those facilities. The decommissioning provision represents

<<<

 the present value of decommissioning costs relating to oil and gas properties, which are expected to be incurred up to 2030 - 2040 which is when the producing oil and gas properties are expected to cease operations.

Estimates and assumptions The Group assesses its decommissioning provision at each reporting

<<<

 date. The ultimate decommissioning costs are uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors, including changes to relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience at other production

<<<

 sites. The expected timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates. This, in turn, will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain. The same assumptions

<<<

 as described in note 3.2 are valid for decommissioning provision in addition to changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation.
The discount rate used in the calculation of the provision as at 31 December 2017 is equal to estimated

<<<

 future U.S. government bond rates and standard premium.

Therefore, significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for decommissioning. As a result, there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established

<<<

 which would affect future financial results. The provision at reporting date represents management's best estimate of the present value of the future decommissioning costs required.
Compensation of decommissioning costs for Jotun As part of

<<<

 the transaction with ExxonMobil in 2017, the seller has in the sale and purchase agreement agreed to pay parts of the decommissioning costs for Jotun and the Group has recorded a receivable against ExxonMobil to cover those costs that are within

<<<

 compensation threshold. The Group expects that all decommis sioning costs within the compensation threshold will be refunded from the seller.

4.3. Commitments and contingencies

Accounting policy - Capital commitments and other contingencies (i) Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease

<<<

 is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset (or

<<<

 assets), even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
Group as a lessee Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the lease term

<<<

.
Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges

<<<

 and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of

interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
A leased asset

<<<

 is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the

<<<

 asset and the lease term.
Operating lease commitments - Group as lessee The Group has entered into operating leases for buildings, and various items of plant and machinery. These leases have an average life of two years (2016: three years)

<<<

, with renewal terms at the option of the lessee whereby the Group can extend at lease terms based on market prices at the time of renewal. There are no restrictions placed upon the Group as a result of entering into these leases. Future minimum

<<<

<<<

 with Heerema. The Group is committed to CHC Helikopter Service AS for 12 months with a standing charge of USD 6.45 million.
Contingencies As part of the aquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream busi ness in Norway, the Group has agreed

<<<

 to pay the seller an annual contingent consideration the following 5 years (2017 - 2021) if the yearly average oil price exceeds a certain threshold. As at 31 December 2017, the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated with

<<<

 option pricing methodology to be USD 22.9 million.
The Group also has to pay a fixed amount and an additional amount per barrel of oil equivalent, that exceeds a threshold of oil equiva lents, if the Group utilize their option to develop the

<<<

 Forseti structure. As at 31 December 2017, the fair value of the contingent considera tion was estimated with a DCF method to USD 33.7 million.

cases where the tax authorities have issued such notifications of disagreement involve a maximum

<<<

 possible tax exposure for Point Resources AS of approximately NOK 20m.
Future deposit requirements As part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement(SPA) with ExxonMobil, the Group shall deposit to the seller a post-tax amount of USD 127 million 

<<<

1 January 2022. According to the Norwegian Petroleum Act Section 5-3(3) ExxonMobil is secondarily financially responsible for the asset retirement obligation related to interest in the oil fields acquired by the Group. ExxonMobil is in accordance

<<<

 with the SPA required to repay (without any delay) Point Resources the entire deposit in an event where the sellers liability do not materialize (i.e. Point Resources fulfills the assets retirement commitments for the acquired licences according

<<<

 to plan).
The Post Completion Payment does not satisfy the definition of a liability under IFRS as the future payment is not an obligation at the acquisition date from past events for Point Resources. The deposit is considered only to be a

<<<

 part of the agreement due to the requirements in the Petroleum Act Section 5-3(3) and not part of the pricing and valuation of the transaction between the parties. The Post Completion Payment is not expected to materialize and Point Resources

<<<

' obligation is already indirectly included under the ARO liability related to the acquired licences at fair value in accordance with IFRS 3.
As the Post Completion Payment does not satisfy the definition of a liability and is not considered

<<<

 to be a part of the transaction, the liability should not be recorded as part of the purchase price allo cation based on the general principles in IFRS 3. The recognition criteria under IAS 37 are not fulfilled either, but will be continuously

<<<

 assessed at future reporting periods.

Point Resources AS has an obligation to hold Pure E&P AS (previously Rocksource ASA) harmless from any claim against it resulting from alleged obligations under a farm-out agreement entered into with ONGC

<<<

 in relation to a block offshore India. Relating to this, ONGC has issued cash calls for the drilling of 3 dry wells, amounting to USD 20.3m (excluding any interest), which Pure E&P AS considers it is not obliged to and has consequently refused

<<<

 to pay. ONGC is pursuing its claim through arbitration proceedings in India.

Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course of business in relation to claims against the Group, including

<<<

 legal, contractor, land access and other claims. By their nature, contin gencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence, and potential quantum, of contingencies

<<<

 inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.

Based on certain historic events involving Pure E&P Norway AS (previously Rocksource Exploration Norway AS) (one of

<<<

 the compa nies involved in the merger creating Point Resources AS), the Oil Taxation Office has issued notifications of disagreement with some of the historic tax filings for Pure E&P Norway AS. Ongoing

4.4. Deferred revenue

A ccounting policy - Sale-and-leaseback transaction When a sale-and-leaseback transaction results in a finance lease, any excess of sales proceeds over the carrying amount should not be recognised immediately as income

<<<

 by a seller/lessee. Instead, the excess is deferred and amortized over the lease term.

After the Group sold the shares in ExxonMobil Property Norway (2) AS, the Group immediately entered into a finance lease for the office building located

<<<

 in Grenseveien 6, 4313 Sandnes. The excess of sales proceeds is deferred and amortized over the lease term (20 years).

Section 5 Financial instruments, capital structure and equity

5.1. Financial instruments

Accounting policy - Financial instruments Classification of financial instruments The Group's financial instruments are classified in

<<<

 the following categories:
· fair value with changes in value through profit or loss (FVPL) · loans and receivables · other financial liabilities
Derivatives are classified as FVPL financial instruments as the Company does not apply hedge accounting

<<<

. Thus, the FVPL instruments are categorised as held for trading from an accounting perspective.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable cash flows that are not quoted in an active market. Other financial

<<<

 liabilities are generally the main category for loans and borrowings.

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement FVPL: Financial derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are categorized as held for trading and initially

<<<

 measured at their fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value are recognised in income statements. The Group has entered into Brent crude oil put options, and the changes in fair value is presented as other income.
Fair value of unlisted

<<<

 shares is estimated by using standard valuation techniques, or is measured at cost if the investment does not have a quoted market price in an active market and the fair value cannot be reliably measured.
Loans and receivables and Other financial

<<<

 liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction expenses. Subsequently, these instruments are measured at their amortized cost.

 Statements

Impairment of financial assets Financial assets valued at amortized cost are impaired when objective evidence exists that the instrument's cash flows have been negatively affected by one or more events occurring after the initial

<<<

 recognition of the instrument. The impairment loss is recognised in the income statements. The loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted with the instruments

 original effective interest rate. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because

of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is

5.2. Financial risk management

Overview The Group is exposed to a range of risks affecting its financial performance, including market risk (commodity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk)

<<<

, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of such risks through sound business practices, risk management and use of derivative financial instruments.
Risk management is carried out by senior management

<<<

 under policies approved by the Board. All derivative activities for risk man agement purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Group's policy that no trading in derivatives

<<<

 for speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
(a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial

<<<

 instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Financial

instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings

<<<

, deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, accrued liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 December 2017 and 2016.
Commodity price risk Point Resources

<<<

 is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in prevailing market commodity prices on the oil products it produces. The Group's policy is to manage these risks through the use of derivative commodity contracts (Brent crude oil put options).
Commodity

<<<

 price sensitivity The table below summarises the impact on profit before tax for changes in commodity prices on the fair value of derivative financial instruments. The impact on equity is the same as the impact on profit after tax as these

<<<

 derivative financial instruments have not been designated as hedges and are classified as held-fortrading and therefore fair valued through the income statements.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest

<<<

 rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's reserve based lending facility with floating interest rate. As at 31 December 2017, the Group does not have any interest hedging instruments

<<<

 nor any fixed rate loan agreements.

Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is

<<<

 the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the value of NOK (functional currency) relative

<<<

 to other currencies, mainly due to sales in USD and operational costs in NOK, USD, GBP and EUR. The Group has also currency risk related to long term credit facility in USD. The Group may seek to reduce the currency risk by entering into foreign

<<<

 currency instruments. The Group does not have any currency hedging

instruments as of 31 December 2017, however management is monitoring movements in exchange rates closely.
Further, fluctuations in NOK/USD may affect the presented figures

(b) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is

<<<

 the risk that Point Resources will encounter diffi culty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by monitoring

<<<

 its debt rating and the maturity dates of existing debt and other payables.
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of resource based lending structures, parent company loan

<<<

 facility, bonds etc. As at 31 December 2017, Point Resources had available USD 159 million (2016: USD 0 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
See note 5.5 for an overview of maturity profile on Point Resources' financial liabilities

<<<

 and accessible borrowing facility from Point Resources Holding AS.

(c) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obliga tions under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. Point

<<<

 Resources trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. See note 5.9 for comments regarding trade receivables ageing. Point Resources' maximum exposure is equal to the carrying

<<<

 amount of the receivables.
As part of the transaction with ExxonMobil in 2017, the seller has in the sale and purchase agreement agreed to pay parts of the decommissioning costs for Jotun and the Group has recorded a receivable against ExxonMobil

<<<

 to cover those costs that are within compensation threshold (note 4.2). The Group expects that all Jotun decommissioning costs will be refunded.

76

Point Resources AS Financial Statements

With respect to credit risk arising from the other

<<<

 financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and derivative financial assets, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The

<<<

 Group's limits its counterparty credit risk on

these assets by dealing only with financial institutions with credit ratings of at least A or equivalent.
Management is of the opinion that Point Resources does not have significant credit risk

<<<

.

5.3. Capital management

The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages

<<<

 its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the require ments of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to share holders

<<<

, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes have been made in the objectives, policies or processes since the inception of Point Resources in May 2016.
The Group's net debt includes interest-bearing loans and borrow ings

<<<

, trade and other payables, less cash and cash deposits.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group's capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans

<<<

 and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches of the financial covenants of any interest bearing

<<<

 loans and borrowing in the current period. Reference is made to section 5.5 for disclosed information regarding interest bearing debt and financial covenants.
The Company has not paid any dividend in 2017.

5.4. Share capital

The Group's shareholder

<<<

, Point Resources Holding AS, has a shareholders agreement with its owners Core Energy Holding AS, Spike Exploration AS and Pure E&P AS which sets guidelines for the Group's management, business operations, funding and investor relations.
The

<<<

Accounting policies - Fair value measurement All assets and liabilities for which fair value

 is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are grouped into classes and categories. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value.


<<<


For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of

<<<

 each reporting period.

Fair value hierarchy The Group measures fair value using the fair value hierarchy as described below, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 Level 2

<<<


There were no transfers between the levels during 2017 or 2016.
Fair value of financial instruments Below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group's financial instruments.
The management assessed that

<<<

 the fair values of cash and short term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the financial

<<<

 assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate

<<<

 the fair values:
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment

grade credit ratings. Commodity put options are valued using valuation techniques, which

<<<

 employ the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include observable inputs and use of present value calculations (hierarchy level 2). The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality

<<<

 of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, oil price spot and forward rates and interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity (oil). All derivative contracts are fully cash collateralised, thereby

<<<

 eliminating both counterparty risk and the Group's own non-performance risk. As at 31 December 2017, the marked-to-market value of derivative asset positions is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counterparty default

<<<

 risk. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on measurement of financial instruments recognised at fair value. The fair value calculations are made by the Group's respective bank relations.
The fair values of the Group

<<<

's interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using the DCF-method using discount rate that reflects the issuer's borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. Point Resources' own non-performance risk as at 31 December

<<<

 2017 was assessed to be insignificant.

6.1. Tax

Accounting policy - Tax Income tax in the statement of income comprises of current and deferred tax expense. Income tax is recognised in the statement of income

<<<

 except when it relates to items recognised in OCI. Current tax consists of the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable for previous years.
Uncertain tax positions and potential tax exposures

<<<

 are analysed individually. The best estimate of the probable amount for liabilities to be paid (unpaid potential tax exposure amounts, including penalties) and for assets to be received (disputed tax positions for which payment has already

<<<

 been made) in each case is recognised within current tax or deferred tax as appropriate.
A tax-free allowance (uplift) of 5.5 percent per year is granted on the basis of capitalised cost on offshore production installations

on NCS. The uplift

<<<

 is deductible from petroleum taxable income over a period of four years from the year the cost incurred. Uplift benefit on the NCS is recognised when the deduction is included in the current year tax return and impacts taxes payable. Unused

<<<

 uplift may be carried forward indefinitely.
Production installations can be depreciated linearly over six years. Depreciation can start as expenses are incurred. Any remaining cost may be deducted in the final year at the end of production

<<<

.
Interest income and interest expenses relating to tax issues are estimated and recognised in the period in which they are earned or incurred, and are presented within Net financial items in the statement of income.

1) For accounting purposes the income statement reflects the acquired operation from ExxonMobil from 1 November 2018. For tax and economic purposes, the effective date was

<<<

 1 January 2017.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, subject to the initial

<<<

 recognition exemption. The amount of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred

<<<

 tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Companies operating on the NCS under the offshore tax regime can claim the tax value of any

<<<

 unused tax losses or other tax credits related to its offshore activities to be paid in cash (including

interest) from the tax authorities when operations cease. Deferred tax assets that are based on offshore tax losses carried forward are

<<<

 therefore normally recognised in full.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the extent that the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority, and there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current

<<<

 tax liabilities. After netting deferred tax assets and liabilities by fiscal entity, deferred taxes are presented on the balance sheet as follows:
Deferred tax assets are recognised based on the expectation that sufficient taxable income will

<<<

 be available through reversal of taxable temporary differences or future taxable income.

Section 8 Other disclosure

8.1. Subsequent events

In January 2018, the Company was awarded ten new licences in the APA 2017 licensing round. In two of the licences

<<<

 Point Resources was appointed operatorship.

13 March 2018, Point Resources successfully completed a senior unsecured bond issue of USD 250 million with maturity in September 2024.

2 March 2018, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate announced

<<<

 an oil discovery in production licence 340. Preliminary estimates indicate that the size of the discovery is between 5 and 10 million standard cubic meters (Sm3) of recoverable oil. The licencees will consider a tie-in of the discovery to the

<<<

 existing infrastructure in the Alvheim area. Point Resources has a 20 per cent participating interest.

On 5 April, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approved the plan for development and operation (PDO) for the Fenja field (PL586) in the

<<<

 Norwegian Sea. The Company has 45 per cent ownership interest in the field.

8.2. Reserves (un-audited)

 field (42.7 million boe) was reclassified from 2C (Contingent Resources) to 2P (Probable reserves).
Production on Balder, Ringhorne and Ringhorne Øst where 13.3 million boe before the business combination and is not reflected in the table above

<<<

. For more information on the business combination see note 2.1. If the transaction with ExxonMobil had occurred 1 January 2017, total production for the Group would have been 17 million boe.
At year end the reserves (2P) and contingent resources

<<<

 (2C) were 369 million barrels of oil equivalent. As discussed in the accounting principles, estimation of oil and gas

reserves and resources involves uncertainty. The figures above represent management's best judgement of the most likely quantity

<<<

 of economically recoverable oil and gas estimated at year-end 2017, given the information at the time of reporting. The estimates have a large spread especially for fields for which there is limited data avail able. The uncertainty will be

<<<

 reduced as more information becomes available through production history and reservoir appraisal. In addition, for fields in the decline phase with limited remaining volumes, fluctuations in oil prices will have a significant impact on the

<<<

 profitability and hence the economic cut-off for production.

8.4. Licences and joint arrangements

Accounting policy - Joint arrangements The Group undertakes a number of business activities through joint arrangements and unincorporated cooperation

<<<

 arrangements. According to IFRS 11 a joint arrangement is an arrangement over which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement which exists only when the decisions

<<<

 about the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. For unincorporated cooperation arrangements various voting rules not necessarily

<<<

 requiring unanimous consent apply.
Joint operations and unincorporated cooperation arrangements A joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement also have rights to the assets and

<<<

 obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.

Licences that are unincorporated cooperation agreements are outside of scope of IFRS 11, but the accounting is generally the same.
In relation to its interests in joint operations

<<<

 and unincorporated cooperation agreements, the Group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow on a line-by-line basis in the financial statements.
Point Resources' portfolio of licences Point Resources have

<<<

 investments in licences on NCS and most of its licences are considered to be joint operations. Point Resources is required to participate in the approved work programs for the licences, and does have joint responsibility for the obligations

<<<

 of its joint operations.
A list of all Point Resources' licences is given below, divided in fields in operation and fields not yet in operation.

8.6. Net profit Interest

Accounting policy - Net profit interest The Norwegian state has large holdings in

<<<

 oil and gas licences on Norway's continental shelf (NCS) through the State's Direct Financial Interest (SDFI). The Balder, Ringhorne and Ringhorne Øst fields are subject to a Net profit interest ("NPI") as these fields are located on some of

<<<

 the first licences issued on the NCS. SDFI receive a share of the net profit of the few fields in Norway subject

to such agreements. Petoro is a state-owned limited company which manages the SDFI in the Norwegian oil and gas sector.
The net

<<<

 profit interest is calculated based quarterly cash flows. Losses in a quarter can be offset against profits in subsequent quarters. NPI related to abandonment costs incurred after cessation of production will be refunded by Petoro.

Point Resources AS Financial Statements

Section 1 Background information

1.1. Corporate

<<<

 information

The financial statements of Point Resources AS ("the Company" or "Point Resources") for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a Board resolution on 27 April 2018. Point Resources AS is a limited

<<<

 liability company incor porated and domiciled in Norway and the Company's shares are privately held. The Company's head office is located at Grenseveien 6, 4313 Sandnes, Norway.
Point Resources is a mid-sized, independent exploration and production

<<<

 (E&P) company with a diverse portfolio of production, development and exploration assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).

On 1 November 2017, Point Resources AS acquired ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil

<<<

 Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisition included a transfer of the majority of ExxonMobil's offshore and onshore E&P staff in Norway; a significant package of operated producing assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; field

<<<

 assets such as platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs); as well as the Company's office building in Sandnes. More detailed information is included in note 2.1.

1.2. Basis for preparation

The Company's financial

<<<

 statements consist of statements of comprehensive income, statements of financial position, state ments of cash flows, statements of changes in equity, and related notes. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International

<<<

 Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by The European Union (EU).
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. Further,

<<<

 the financial statements are prepared based on the going concern assumption.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the Company's entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction

<<<

 first qualifies for recognition. For presentation purposes, balance sheet items are translated from functional currency to presentation currency by using spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Items within total comprehensive income

<<<

 are translated from functional currency to presentation
currency by use of average exchange rates for each month.

The financial statements are presented in USD and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (000), except when otherwise

<<<

 indi cated. The parent company's functional currency is NOK. The Company has chosen to present its financial statements in USD, as this is a commonly used presentation currency among oil and gas companies.

1.3. General accounting principles

S ignificant accounting judgem ents, estim ates and assum ptions The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the

<<<

 reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjust

<<<

 ment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affecting future periods. The Company bases its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements are prepared.

Existing circumstances and assumptions about

<<<

 future develop ments may change due to market changes or circumstances that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions as they occur.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources

<<<

 of estimating uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are listed below and are also discussed in the individual

<<<

 notes of the related financial statement line items.

Current versus non-current classification The Company presents assets and liabilities in the statements of financial position based on

<<<

 current/non-current classification.
An asset is current when it is: · Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in
the normal operating cycle · Held primarily for the purpose of trading · Expected realised within twelve months

<<<

 after the reporting period · Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged
or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current

<<<

 when: · It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle · It is held primarily for the purpose of trading · It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period · There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement

<<<

 of the
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period

The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs Borrowing

<<<

 costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construc tion or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset

<<<

. Borrowing costs are only capitalized during the development phase. Qualifying assets are generally those that are subject to major development or construction projects. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur

<<<

. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

1.4. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures

Section 2 Operating performance

2.1. Business combinations

A ccounting policy - Business com binations A business combination is as a transaction or other event

<<<

 in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Determining whether a particular set of assets and activities is a

<<<

 business should be based on whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured

<<<

 as consideration transferred representing acquisition date fair value. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred

<<<

 and included in general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed).
After initial recognition, goodwill

<<<

 is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Company's cash-gen erating units that are

<<<

 expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
A cq u isitio n o f ExxonM obil's operated upstream business in N orw ay On 1 November, 2017, the Company

<<<

 acquired ExxonMobil's oper ated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisition included a transfer of the majority of ExxonMobil's offshore and onshore E&P staff in Norway; a significant package

<<<

 of operated producing assets

(Balder, Ringhorne, Ringhorne Øst and Jotun) on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; field assets such as platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs); as well as the Company's office building

<<<

 in Sandnes.
The business was acquired by and combined with Point Resources AS to create a strong, new mid-sized Norwegian E&P company. With an asset portfolio that includes several fields in the develop ment phase, the combined Company has

<<<

 the potential to grow its production base organically to over 90 000 boepd by 2022, and has proven and probable reserves and contingent resources of about 369 million barrels of oil equivalent at year end 2017.
As part of the transaction the

<<<

 Company acquired 100 percent of the shares in in Standard Marine Nordsjø AS and in ExxonMobil Property Norway (2) AS. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 5 percent of the interest in PR Jotun DA.
Standard Marine Nordsjø AS later

<<<

 changed name to Point Resources FPSO AS. Shares in Point Resources FSPO AS and PR Jotun DA were incorporated in the new company Point Resources FPSO Holding AS.
The shares in ExxonMobil Property Norway (2) AS (later changed name to Grenseveien

<<<

 6 AS) were sold to ABP Holdco AS imme diately after the acquisition and the Company entered a lease agreement with the new owner. For more information on the transaction see note 4.3 and 4.4.
The transaction with ExxonMobil Exploration and

<<<

 Production Norway AS is recorded as a Business Combination in accordance with IFRS 3. The acquisition date for accounting purposes corre sponds to the finalisation date of the transaction on 1 November 2017. For tax and economic purposes, the

 effective date was 1 January 2017.

 consideration that exceeds the tax position acquired from the seller. Provision for deferred tax is made for the difference between acquisition cost and acquired tax base in accordance with IAS 12. Offsetting entry of this non-cash deferred

<<<

 tax is technical goodwill.
The remaining goodwill of USD 80.6 million comprises the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition and assembled workforce, which is not separately recognised. Goodwill is allocated entirely to operations

<<<

 on the the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The valuation is based on currently available information about fair values as of the acquisition date. If

<<<

 new information becomes available within 12 months from the acquisition date, the Company may change the fair value assessment in the Purchase price allocation, in accordance with guidance in IFRS 3. Any adjustments will result in a corresponding

 adjustment of goodwill.

3.2. Oil and gas properties

A cco u n tin g p o licy - Oil and gas

<<<

 pro pe rties (i) Initial recognition Oil and gas properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly

<<<

 attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation and, for qualifying assets (where relevant), borrowing costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and

<<<

 the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. The capitalised value of a finance lease is also included within property, plant and equipment.
When a development project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation

<<<

 of certain construction/ development costs ceases, and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to oil and gas property asset additions, improvements

<<<

 or new developments.

(ii) Depreciation/am ortisation Oil and gas properties are depreciated/amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total proved developed, proved undeveloped and probable reserves expected to be recovered of the relevant

<<<

 fields. The depletion rate takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated future capital expenditures.
The estimated reserves, asset's residual values and methods of depreciation/amortisation are reviewed annually

<<<

 and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
(iii) Major maintenance, inspection and repairs Where an asset, or part of an asset that was separately depre ciated and is now written off is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits

<<<

 associated with the item will flow to the Company, the expenditure is capitalised. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programmes are capitalised and amortised over the period to the next inspection. All other dayto-day repairs

<<<

 and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

A ccounting policy - Im pairm ent losses (non financial assets excluding goodw ill) The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication

<<<

 that an asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) may be impaired. Management has assessed its CGU's as being an individual field, which is the lowest level for which cash inflows are largely independent of those of other assets. If any indication

<<<

 exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and value in use

<<<

 (VIU). The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which case the asset is tested as part of a

<<<

 larger CGU to which it belongs. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset/CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

In calculating VIU, the estimated future cash

<<<

 flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset/CGU. The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets

<<<

 and forecasts, which are prepared separately for each of the Company's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognised in the statements of comprehensive

<<<

 income.
For assets/CGUs excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. A previously recognised

<<<

 impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's/CGU's recoverable amount since the last

108

Point Resources AS Financial Statements

impairment loss was recognised. The reversal

<<<

 is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset/CGU does not exceed either its recoverable amount, or the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation/amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the

<<<

 asset/CGU in prior years. Such a reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Estim ates and assum ptions Refer to Note 3.2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements disclos ing information to the Company's estimates and

<<<

 assumptions.

Im pairm ents The Company has not recognised any impairments of oil and gas properties in 2017 or 2016.
Value in use is calculated by discounting future cash flows after tax. Key assumptions used in the impairment tests as at

<<<

 31 December 2017 is described in note 3.2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.3. Other Property, plant and equipment

A ccounting policy - Other property, plant and equipm ent (i) Initial recognition Equivalent to oil and gas properties

<<<

, see note 3.2.
The carrying value of property, plant and machinery held under finance leases at 31 December 2017 was USD 23.9 million. Additions during the year include USD 24.2 million of property under finance leases. For more information

<<<

 on the lease see note 4.3 and 4.4.
(ii) Depreciation/am ortisation Other property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases

<<<

 are depreciated over the shorter of lease term and estimated useful life.

(iii) Major maintenance, inspection and repairs Equivalent to oil and gas properties, see note 3.2.
Im pairm ent losses (non-financial assets) Equivalent to oil and

 may no longer exist related to other property, plant and equipment.

Asset's residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation/amor tisation are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

3.4. Goodwill and other intangible assets

A ccounting policy - Other intangible assets and goodw ill G o o d

<<<

 w ill Goodwill arises principally because of the following factors:
· The ability to capture unique synergies that can be realised from managing a portfolio of both acquired and existing fields
· The requirement to recognise deferred tax assets

<<<

 and liabilities for the difference between the assigned values and the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at amounts that do not reflect fair value (more information in note 2.1)

Other intangible

<<<

 assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recog nition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible

<<<

 assets with definite lives are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation (generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives) and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Indefinite lived intangibles are

<<<

 not amortised, instead they are tested for impairment at least annually. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs and E&E assets, are not capitalised. Instead, the

A ccounting policy - Im pairm ent losses goodw ill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Impairment is deter mined

 for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or group of CGU's to which the good will relates. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount of the asset including goodwill,

 an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. For more information on accounting policies, estimates and assumptions see note 3.2.
When assessing impairment of technical goodwill

, recognised deferred tax related to a business combination (see more infor mation in note 2.1) will reduce net book value before impairment assessment. Going forward depreciation of excess values from the acquisition analysis will lead to a

 reduction in deferred tax liability, hence more technical goodwill will be exposed for impairment.

5.2. Financial risk management

O v e rv ie w The Company is exposed to a range of risks affecting its financial performance, including

<<<

 market risk (commodity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of such risks through sound business practices, risk management and use of derivative financial

<<<

 instruments.
Risk management is carried out by senior management under policies approved by the Board. All derivative activities for risk man agement purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience

<<<

 and supervision. It is the Company's policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
(a) M arket risk Market

<<<

 risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency

<<<

 risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings,

deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, accrued liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
Com m odity price risk and sensitivity Refer to Note 

<<<

5.2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements disclosing information to the Company's market risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of

<<<

 changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company's reserve based lending facility with floating interest rate in addition to interest income on receivables

<<<

 against subsidiaries. Currently, the Company does not have any interest hedging instruments nor any fixed rate loan agreements.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates

(b) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that

<<<

 Point Resources will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by monitoring its debt

<<<

 rating and the maturity dates of existing debt and other payables.
The Company's objective is to maintain a balance between con tinuity of funding and flexibility through the use of reserve based lending structures, parent company loan facility

<<<

, bonds etc. As at

31 December 2017, Point Resources had available USD 159 million (2016: USD 0 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
See note 5.5 for an overview of maturity profile on Point Resources' financial liabilities and

<<<

 accessible borrowing facility from Point Resources Holding AS.
(c) Credit risk The external credit risk is described in note 5.2 in the consolidated financial statement. In addition the parent company has credit risk related to receivables

<<<

 against subsidiaries. The credit risk is deemed low.
Management is of the opinion that Point Resources does not have significant credit risk.

The table above discloses information about all assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.
There were no transfers between the levels during 2017 or 2016.
Fair value o f fina ncial in

<<<

 stru m en ts Below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments.
The management assessed that the fair values of cash and short term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and

<<<

 other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged

<<<

 in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with vari ous

<<<

 counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment

grade credit ratings. Commodity put options are valued using valuation techniques, which employ the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques

<<<

 include observable inputs and use of present value calculations (hierarchy level 2). The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, oil price spot and forward rates

<<<

 and interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity (oil). All derivative contracts are fully cash collateralised, thereby eliminating both counterparty risk and the Company's own non-performance risk. As at 31 December

<<<

 2017, the marked-to-market value of derivative asset positions is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counterparty default risk. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on measurement of financial

<<<

 instruments recognised at fair value. The fair value calculations are made by the Company's respective bank relations.
The fair values of the Company's interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using the DCF-method using discount

<<<

 rate that reflects the issuer's borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. Point Resources' own non-performance risk as at 31 December 2017 was assessed to be insignificant.

Section 6 Tax

6.1. Tax

A ccounting policy - Tax Income

<<<

 tax in the statement of income comprises of current and deferred tax expense. Income tax is recognised in the statement of income except when it relates to items recognised in OCI. Current tax consists of the expected tax payable on the taxable

<<<

 income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable for previous years.
Uncertain tax positions and potential tax exposures are analysed individually. The best estimate of the probable amount for liabilities to be paid (unpaid potential tax

<<<

 exposure amounts, including penalties) and for assets to be received (disputed tax positions for which payment has already been made) in each case is recognised within current tax or deferred tax as appropriate.
A tax-free allowance (uplift

<<<

) of 5.5 percent per year is granted on

the basis of capitalised cost on offshore production installations on NCS. The uplift is deductible from taxable income over a period of four years from the year the cost incurred. Uplift benefit on the

<<<

 NCS is recognised when the deduction is included in the current year tax return and impacts taxes payable. Unused uplift may be carried forward indefinitely.
Production installations can be depreciated linearly over six years. Depreciation

<<<

 can start as expenses are incurred. Any remaining cost may be deducted in the final year at the end of production.
Interest income and interest expenses relating to tax issues are estimated and recognised in the period in which they are earned

<<<

 or incurred, and are presented within Net financial items in the statement of income.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities

<<<

 and their respective tax bases, subject to the initial recognition exemption. The amount of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted

<<<

 or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Companies operating on the NCS

<<<

 under the offshore tax regime can claim the tax value of any unused tax losses or other tax credits related to its offshore activities to be paid in cash (including

interest) from the tax authorities when operations cease. Deferred tax assets

<<<

 that are based on offshore tax losses carried forward are therefore normally recognised in full.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the extent that the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority, and there is a legally

<<<

 enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities. After netting deferred tax assets and liabilities by fiscal entity, deferred taxes are presented on the balance sheet as follows:
Deferred tax assets are recognised

<<<

 based on the expectation that sufficient taxable income will be available through reversal of taxable temporary differences or future taxable income.

 laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the A u d ito r's R e sp o n sib

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information

<<<

, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities o f the Board o f Directors and the Managing D irector fo r the Financial Statem ents
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management

<<<

) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal

<<<

 control as managem ent determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, w hether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for

<<<

 assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group

<<<

 or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the A udit o f the Financial Statem ents
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole

<<<

 are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance

<<<

 with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if

<<<

, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards

<<<

 and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgm ent and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements

<<<

, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement

<<<

 resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant

<<<

 to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness

<<<

 of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence

<<<

 obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are

<<<

 required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date

<<<

 of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the

<<<

 disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
