SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - PROPOSED EXTENSION OF M A TU R ITY

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bond issues with ISIN NO 001 062253.3 and ISIN NO 001 062337.4 (the "Bond Loans") with Emerging

<<<

 Europe Land Development AS (the "Issuer") as Borrower.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement dated 15 July 2011 (in respect of Bond Issue no. 1) and the Bond Agreement dated 21 October

<<<

 2011 (in respect of Bond Issue no. 2) (together the "Bond Agreements") or in the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.
The information regarding the operational andfinancial status o f the Issuer and market conditions

<<<

 is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever to such information.

1.

BACKGROUND

Under the Bond Agreements, Bond Issue no. 1, including all interest accrued thereon, is due to be repaid on 

<<<

16 July 2012 and Bond Issue no. 2, including all interest accrued thereon, is due to be repaid on 24 October 2012.

The Issuer currently does not have sufficient funds available to repay the Bond Loans on their respective Maturity Dates.

The

<<<

 Issuer's inability to repay the Bond Loans will constitute a Default Conversion Event under the Bond Agreements. The occurrence of a Default Conversion Event will mean that both the Issuer and the Bondholders will have a right and a duty to

<<<

 convert the Bond Loans, including accrued interest, into shares in the Issuer at a Default Conversion Price of NOK 1.50 per share.

Against this background the Issuer proposes that the maturity of each of the Bond Loans is extended by one year

<<<

, i.e. until 16 July 2013 for Bond Issue no. 1 and until 24 October 2013 for Bond Issue no.2. The Issuer further proposes that the Interest Payment Date of each of the Bond Loans is also extended by one year, meaning that interest at a rate

<<<

 of 15 per cent p.a. will continue to accrue on the Bond Loans until 16 July 2013 and 24 October 2013 respectively.
