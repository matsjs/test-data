2.

BACKGROUND

Polarcus is continuously working to improve its financial position and has over some time actively pursued several funding options including long-term take out financing for its two new buildings Polarcus

<<<

 Amani and Polarcus Adira currently under construction at Ulstein Verft AS in Norway with scheduled delivery in March 2012 and June 2012, respectively. Polarcus has in parallel worked with different alternatives for refinancing of Polarcus Asima

<<<

, Polarcus Alima and Polarcus Samur.

It has been apparent for Polarcus that a refinancing structured as a larger fleet financing is the most cost efficient solution for the Company. Polarcus has enjoyed good response in the current bank market

<<<

 and has on the 20 July 2011 signed a fully committed and underwritten offer for a USD 410 million credit and guarantee facility (the "Fleet Bank Facility") with five single purpose companies as borrowers on a joint and several basis. The Fleet

<<<

 Bank Facility will be funded by Eksportfinans ASA through a combination of attractive Commercial Interest Reference Rate ("CIRR") and USD LIBOR based funding, guaranteed by DnB NOR Bank ASA, DVB Bank SE, Nordic Branch with counter guarantee

<<<

 from DZ Bank AG and GIEK.

The purpose of the Fleet Bank Facility is to provide long-term post-delivery financing of the following five vessels: Polarcus Asima, Polarcus Alima, Polarcus Samur and the two new buildings Polarcus Amani and Polarcus

<<<

 Adira (together the "Vessels"). The Fleet Bank Facility will be secured inter alia by first priority cross collateralised mortgages on the Vessels, its insurances and earnings and guaranteed by Polarcus Limited.

The Company considers the establishment

<<<

 of the Fleet Bank Facility to be a major milestone and achievement for the Group as it proves the creditworthiness of the Group among well reputed and leading shipping/offshore banks. By establishing the Fleet Bank Facility, the Group will

<<<

 complete and secure long-term financing of its total fleet.

The Bond Issue is currently secured by a 2nd priority mortgage in the vessels Polarcus Alima and Polarcus Asima ranking behind USD 135,000,000 of senior debt. In order to establish

<<<

 the Fleet Bank Facility changes to the Bond Agreement are required. Consequently, Polarcus is proposing certain amendments to the Bond Agreement as described in detail in the Proposal below.

The Company considers the Fleet Bank Facility to

<<<

 be advantageous to all stakeholders of the Company including the Bondholders for the following reasons:

® Extended and improved security structure ® Reduced refinancing risk ® Improved cash flow through lower interest cost

Extended and improved

<<<

 security structure The current security for the Bond Issue includes inter alia second priority security related to the two vessels as mentioned above. Through the Proposal, the Company offers the Bondholders an extended security structure through

<<<

 second priority cross collateralised security related to all of the Vessels ranking after in total USD 435 million which includes the Fleet Bank Facility and an additional amount of USD 25

2

million. The latter is related to a current USD

<<<

 30 million second mortgage in Polarcus Samur in favour of DYB Bank.
Polarcus proposes that, prior to the drawdown of any new financing included in the Senior Debt Facility, the Bond Issue shall in principal be secured on second priority by

<<<

 the same security structure as the Fleet Bank Financing including inter alia:
1. Second priority cross-collateralised mortgages in the Vessels; 2. Second priority assignment of relevant guarantees and warranties from Ulstein Verft
AS related

<<<

 to Polarcus Amani and Polarcus Adira; 3. Second priority Assignment of Earnings related to the Vessels on a floating charge
basis; 4. Second priority Assignment of Vessel Insurances in all Vessels; 5. Second priority Share Pledge in the shares

<<<

 of the Vessel owning companies; 6. Second priority assignment of any charter party/employment contract with duration
of more than 12 months related to each of the Vessels; 7. Second priority Assignment of any Intercompany Loans from Polarcus

<<<

 Limited to
any of the Vessel owning companies; 8. Second priority floating Equipment Charge of any inventory of Norwegian
incorporated borrowers and for any borrowers in other jurisdictions where legally and practically possible; and 9. Unconditional

<<<

 and irrevocable on-demand guarantee from Polarcus Limited;
Any other existing security under the Bond Issue shall otherwise remain unchanged. The current inter-creditor agreement will be amended to reflect the new security structure but otherwise

<<<

 in principle remain unchanged.
By accepting the Proposal, the Bondholders will benefit from the operation of five vessels compared to only two vessels under the existing Bond Issue. The fleet financing will be ring-fenced from other financings

<<<

 at subsidiary level within the Group, however, all Vessel owning companies are joint and several liable which will represent a diversification of the implied credit risk for the Bondholders.
The Bondholders will additionally, through the cross

<<<

 default provisions in the Bond Agreement, benefit from the new financial covenants regime applicable to the Fleet Bank Facility and to be calculated on a consolidated basis for the Polarcus Group including a minimum liquidity reserve of USD

<<<

 25 million, minimum Equity Ratio of 25%, a Working Capital ratio excluding current portion of long-term debt to be minimum USD 22 million and a Debt Service Ratio of 1.25x to 4Q 2011, 1.5x to 4Q 2012, 2.Ox to 4Q 2013 and 3.Ox anytime from IQ

<<<

 2014.
A comparison of the estimated Loan-to-Value ("LTV") shows that the proposed amended security structure achieves a lower LTV than the existing Bond. When applying updated broker values the LTV for Polarcus Alima and Polarcus Asima was

<<<

 64.4% at the issue date of the Bond. Assuming the Fleet Bank Facility being fully drawn, the proposed amended security structure achieves a comparable LTV of 60.0%. The Fleet Bank Facility is expected to be fully drawn in Q2/Q3 2012.
3

Reduced

<<<

 refinancing risk Through the establishment of the Fleet Bank Facility the average duration of the Company's long-term interest bearing debt will increase from 5.8 years to 7.8 years. In 2015, the same year as the Bond Issue matures, scheduled

<<<

 debt repayments are reduced from USD 147 million to USD 121 million following establishment of the Fleet Bank Facility or expressed as a percentage of outstanding debt from 22% to 13%, respectively.
Improved cash flow through lower interest

<<<

 cost The average weighted interest rate for the Polarcus Group subsequent the Fleet Bank Facility being fully utilised is estimated to be 7.4% compared to 8.6% prior to the refinancing.
