To the bondholders in:

ISIN: N00010673791 - 10% IGas Energy Pic Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2018

Information notice re. Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap
Reference is made to the summons to Bondholders' Meetings (the "Summons

<<<

") that was issued on 17 March 2017 in respect of the above mentioned bond issue (the "Secured Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by IGas Energy Plc (the "Issuer"), and the announcement on 3 April 2017 that the Proposal (as defined in the Summons

<<<

) was approved by the bondholders' meeting of the Secured Bonds on 3 April 2017.
Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement and the Summons, including its Annex 2 (Summary of Bondholders Transactions

<<<

).
As previously announced by the Issuer and in addition to the shares issued under the Voluntary Equity Exchange, the holders of the Secured Bonds are entitled to receive New Ordinary Shares in the Issuer issued in the Conditional Secured Debt

<<<

 for Equity Swap. Secured Bonds with a face value of USD 11,081,609 (the "Conditional Conversion Bonds") will be converted into 202,398,272 New Ordinary Shares of the Issuer under the Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap.

The New Ordinary

<<<

 Shares will be issued by the Issuer and transferred to a nominee account in the name of Cooley Services Limited on 4 April 2017. Cooley Services Limited will hold the New Ordinary Shares as nominee and on trust for the holders of the Registered

<<<

 Rights (as defined below). The ISIN number for the New Ordinary Shares is GB 00B29PWM59, and the EPIC is "IGas".

To facilitate the settlement of the Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap, the Conditional Conversion Bonds will be converted

<<<

 into registered rights (the "Registered Rights") in the Securities Depository (VPS) under a separate ISIN (NO001 0790496). The Registered Rights and the cancellation of the Conditional Conversion Bonds will be allocated pro rata between the

<<<

 Bondholders after the cancellation of all Issuer's Bonds and the Secured Bonds exchanged to shares in the Voluntary Equity Exchange. It is expected that the Registered Rights will be registered in the Bondholders' VPS accounts on or about 

<<<

7 April 2017.
Each holder of Registered Rights will be entitled to receive a number of New Ordinary Shares determined by the following formula:

N = RR x TN / CCB

where

N = the number of New Ordinary Shares (rounded down, if necessary, to

<<<

 the nearest whole number of New Ordinary Shares)

RR = the number of Registered Rights delivered to the Paying Agent by the holder

TN = 202,398,272 (being the total number of New Ordinary Shares issued in exchange of the Conditional Conversion

<<<

 Bonds)

CCB

11,081,609 (being the total number of Conditional Conversion Bonds)

In order to receive its New Ordinary Shares, each Bondholder will have to take (or instruct its custodian or nominee to take) the following actions during the

<<<

 period commencing on 10 April 2017 and ending on 1 April 2020:

(i)

(physical) or uncertificated form (CREST);

(ii) Provide to Cooley Services Limited

<<<

 (as agent for the Issuer) the usual documents required for compliance with the 4th Money Laundering Directive - these must relate to the ultimate beneficial holder;

(iii) Instruct its account manager with the VPS to transfer its holding of

<<<

 Registered Rights to the Paying Agent's (being DNB Bank ASA) account in VPS;

(iv) If certificated delivery is required, provide the name and address to be entered on the Register of members and for delivery of the certificate;

(v) If CREST

<<<

<<<

<<<

<<<

 to those Registered Rights to that Bondholder in accordance with the instructions received.
