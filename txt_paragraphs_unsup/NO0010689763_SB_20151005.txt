 Callable Bond Issue 2013/2018

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Oslo, 5 October 2015

1. PARTIES
Nordic Trustee ASA (formerly Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee")) acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the

<<<

 above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue" or the "Bonds") in respect of which Iona Energy Company (UK) pic (formerly Iona Energy Company (UK) Limited (the "Issuer")) is the issuer and Iona Energy Inc. ("Iona" or the "Parent") and Iona UK

<<<

 Huntington Limited (the "Huntington Subsidiary") are the guarantors.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally dated 26 September 2013 (as amended on 3 June 2014 and as amended

<<<

 and restated on 17 April 2015) and made between the Issuer, the Parent, the Huntington Subsidiary and the Bond Trustee (the "Bond Agreement") or in the summons dated 30 July 2015 to the Bondholders' Meeting held 6 August 2015 (including the

<<<

 attachments thereto, the "July Summons") or in the summons dated 23 September 2015 (including the attachments thereto, the "September Summons"), unless otherwise stated herein or therein.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer

<<<

 and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
2. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL
As highlighted in the September Summons, substantial

<<<

 progress has been made to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Restructuring.
However, certain macro-economic factors and certain items specific to the Issuer have impacted the Issuer's view of future potential liquidity requirements up

<<<

 to First Oil at the Orlando Asset. These include:
(a) volatility in the oil price;
(b) volatility in the GBP:USD FX rate; and
(c) a provision for later Huntington capex and consequent re-phasing of revenue arising from that Huntington capex

With respect to the Huntington Asset, the Issuer and its joint venture partners have continued to progress technical work to support further investment in the field

<<<

 and the Issuer expects that investment in a sidetrack to a water injector well will be sanctioned during Q4 2015. However, the timing of the new investment is likely to be later than assumed in the Issuer's prior financial planning and so the

<<<

 cash flow benefit from this investment is unlikely to be seen until after First Oil at the Orlando Asset. The Issuer is strongly supportive of the water injector sidetrack project, which is expected to increase recoverable reserves and extend

<<<

 field life at the Huntington Asset.
To provide the Issuer with additional liquidity to accommodate the factors referred to in points (a) to (c) above, and following extensive discussions with the Ad Hoc Committee, the Issuer is proposing to

<<<

 defer the USD 24 million Restricted Cash Repayment originally proposed to be paid on the Restructuring Implementation Date and retain this cash to provide additional financial headroom.
The terms of the Proposal (as defined below) are summarised

<<<

 in Clause 3 and set out in full in the term sheet (the "New Money Term Sheet") attached to this summons as Schedule A - Proposed Terms Bondholders' New Money.
3. PROPOSAL
Based on the above, the Issuer hereby proposes certain amendments to

<<<

 the terms of the Restructuring approved by the Bondholders' Meeting held on 6 August 2015, as amended by the Bondholders' Meeting held on 30 September 2015 (the "Proposal"):
3.1 Amendments to the terms of the Restructuring
(a) The Restricted

<<<

 Cash Payment to Bondholders contemplated on the Restructuring Implementation Date in an amount of USD 24 million will be deferred. Accordingly, on the Restructuring Implementation Date, the Bond Debt will be reduced to USD 144 million, rather

<<<

 than to USD 120 million.
(b) Due to the deferral of the Restricted Cash Payment, the percentage of Warrants which will be exchanged into new warrants with a shorter term until 11 May 2016 pursuant to section 2.1 of the terms of the Warrants

<<<

 will be reduced from approximately 59% to approximately 54%.
(c) On the Restructuring Implementation Date, USD 24 million will be transferred from the Escrow Account to a separate account (the "Bondholder New Money Account"). The Bondholder

<<<

 New Money Account will be blocked and charged in favour of the Bond Trustee.
(d) The amounts standing to the credit of the Bondholder New Money Account will be disbursed to the Issuer pursuant to the terms and conditions which are set out in

<<<

 Schedule A - Proposed Terms - Bondholders' New Money.
(e) The Intercreditor Principles between the Issuer, the Parent, the Huntington Subsidiaiy, Lender A, Lender B, BTL, the Security Agent and the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders

<<<

) will be updated to reflect the principles set out in Schedule B - Proposed Amendments to Intercreditor Principles - Bondholder New Money.
3.2 Appointment of FTI
The Bond Trustee shall be authorized to appoint, at the cost of the Issuer, FTI

<<<

 Consulting LLP ("FTI") to advise the Bond Trustee with respect to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent for the disbursement of amounts standing to the credit of the Bondholder New
