Sea Trucks International Limited Callable Bond Issue 2017/

<<<

2018

Oslo, 6 February 2018

Notice of a Written Bondholders' Resolution

1. NOTICE OF A WRITTEN BONDHOLDERS' RESOLUTION

Nordic Trustee AS (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds from time to time (the "Bondholders

<<<

") in the abovementioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue" or the "Bonds"), in respect of which Sea Trucks International Limited is the issuer (the "Issuer", and together with its parent, Sea Trucks Group Limited (in liquidation) (the "Parent") and

<<<

 the Parent's other subsidiaries, the "Group").

Unless otherwise stated herein, all capitalised terms used but not defined in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meaning given to them in the bond agreement for the Bond Issue originally

<<<

 dated 23 June 2017 and entered into between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee (the "Bond Agreement").

The Bond Trustee has issued this request for a Written Resolution under Clause 16.5 ( Written Resolutions) of the Bond Agreement pursuant to

<<<

 a request from the Issuer under Clause 16.5.2 of the Bond Agreement.

FURTHER, IF THE PROPOSAL IN THIS SUMMONS IS APPROVED BY BONDHOLDERS, IT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL BONDHOLDER TO LIAISE WITH ITS CU STO D IA N S IN RESPECT

<<<

 OF THE NEW BONDS ALLOCATED TO THAT BONDHOLDER.

2. BACKGROUND

2.1 Appointment of Liquidators

On 12 June 2017, and by Order of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court in the High Court of Justice British Virgin Islands, Chad Griffin of FTI Consulting

<<<

 LLP and Ian Morton of FTI Consulting (BVI) Limited, were appointed as Joint Liquidators of the Parent pursuant to Section 159(1) of the Insolvency Act, 2003 (the "Liquidators").

The Parent's subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries") are not currently

<<<

 subject to any insolvency proceedings and the appointment of the Liquidators has had no direct impact on the day-today operations of the Group. The current directors of the Subsidiaries (together with the

1

NORDIC TRUSTEE
directors of the

<<<

 Issuer, the "Current Directors") and management team of the Subsidiaries have retained control of the Subsidiaries, which remain fully operational.
2.2 Liquidity
Following their appointment, the Liquidators worked with management to understand

<<<

 the Group's liquidity position. The Group's base case short term cash flow forecast showed limited headroom and potential uncertainty around the timing of certain cash flows. Consequently, management and the Liquidators determined it necessary

<<<

 to seek further funding for the Group in the amount of USD 25,000,000 pursuant to the Bond Issue.
The Bonds were issued to the Bondholders by the Issuer on 23 June 2017. Pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement dated 23 June 201

<<<

7, the obligation to repay the Bonds ranks senior to the obligation to repay the STG Bonds.
2.3 Business Plan
As previously communicated to Bondholders pursuant to a notice published on Stamdata on 26 September 2017, the Group's management prepared

<<<

 a business plan for the Group's future commercial activities. That business plan was subsequently updated and key figures are summarised in the document appended hereto at Schedule 2 (the "Business Plan"). The Business Plan primarily focuses

<<<

 on the future operations of the Group's DP3 capable vessels, namely, the Jascon 25, the Jascon 28, the Jascon 31, the Jascon 34 (together, referred to herein as the "DP3s") and the Jascon 30. The DP3s and the Jascon 30 are secured in favour

<<<

 of the Bond Trustee for the bonds issued by the Parent (the "STG Bonds" and the holders thereof, the "STG Bondholders") (the "STG Bond Trustee") as collateral for the STG Bonds. They contribute the majority of the current gross asset value

<<<

 of the Group and have potential for future deployment in multiple international markets for oil and gas services.
Although the Jascon 30 is also a DP3 capable vessel owned by the Group and its projected future revenues have been included in

<<<

 the Business Plan from the second half of 2018 onwards, this vessel is currently the subject of ongoing litigation proceedings in Nigeria involving West African Ventures Limited ("WAV") (WAV being the former Nigerian operating partner to the

<<<

 Group). Further, the Group has launched arbitration proceedings in London seeking repossession of the vessel. The Jascon 30 is therefore not presently in the physical control of either the Liquidators or any entity within the Group and realisation

<<<

 of the projected revenue in respect of the Jascon 30 as set out in the Business Plan is dependent on the resolution of these ongoing disputes and recovery of the vessel. For further details, please see section 2.4 below.
2.4 Commercial and

<<<

 Litigation Actions
The proceedings in relation to the Jascon 30 are one of a number of legal and commercial actions involving the Group. The actions taken by the Group to date have been aimed at protecting and recovering the Group's assets

<<<

 and recovering amounts owed to the Group by WAV. In addition, WAV has also launched a number of commercial and legal actions against the Group in Nigeria, which the Group is defending.
2

NORDIC TRUSTEE
The Group's Other Offshore and Inland

<<<

 Marine Support Services vessels (the "OOIM Vessels") have historically been chartered directly to WAV and operated by WAV in Nigeria. For a number of months, WAV has refused to pay the hire amounts owed to the Group under the relevant charter

<<<

 agreements and to redeliver the OOIM Vessels, as it was contractually required to do. As a result, the Group terminated the charter agreements with WAV. Accordingly, WAV currently has no right to continue to operate or possess any of the Group

<<<

's vessels.
In support of the termination of the charter agreements, the Group has launched arbitration proceedings in London. These proceedings are in addition to other arbitration proceedings commenced by the Group in London which are all

<<<

 aimed at recovering certain vessels owned by the Group that are currently held by WAV.
As well as the ongoing legal and commercial steps taken above, the Group has also sought to engage with WAV in consensual discussions to facilitate the return

<<<

 of the OOIM Vessels and the Jascon 30 to the Group. At this time, no agreement has been reached with WAV. The Group nevertheless remains open to achieving a consensual resolution to all on-going disputes with WAV. However, if an agreement cannot

<<<

 be reached, the Group is committed to recovering and protecting its assets in Nigeria to ensure that they are available to service the on-going needs of the Nigerian oil and gas industry (together, the "Actions").
A summary of the material

<<<

 aspects of the key Actions as at the date of this Summons is set out below:
(i) WAV commenced proceedings in Nigeria asserting co-ownership of several vessels owned by Group companies. On 14 December 2017, the relevant Nigerian court ruled

<<<

 in favour of the Group's position that the proceedings before the court should be stayed in favour of arbitration in London. WAV has sought leave to appeal the decision of the first instance judge and additionally sought to appeal the stay

<<<

 granted in favour of the arbitration proceedings. WAV's appeal in turn has been opposed by the Group;
(ii) pursuant to an arrest application brought by WAV, the Jascon 30 has been subject to arrest since April 2017 at its location in port at

<<<

 Onne, Nigeria. A decision on the Group's preliminary objections in this case was handed down on 15 January 2018 in which the preliminary objections brought by the Group were dismissed and a date was set for a substantive hearing in March 2

<<<

018. The Group has filed an appeal against this judgement;
(iii) WAV has brought separate proceedings, which seek to assert that the Group is party to an alleged "non-compete" agreement (the "NCA") which WAV argues prevents it from operating

<<<

 in Nigeria and West Africa. The latest hearing in these proceedings in Nigeria took place on 16 January 2018. The hearing resulted in a postponement of the hearing for both preliminary objections and substantive matters to 15 February 2018

<<<

. Additionally, the Liquidators, exercising their powers under BVI law, have given notice to the BVI court of a disclaimer of the NCA. This action is without prejudice to their and the Group's views, set out in legal submissions in the pertinent

<<<

 proceedings
3

NORDIC TRUSTEE
that the NCA is not a valid document and, further, that for various different reasons, the Issuer and the vessel owning Subsidiaries are not bound by it;
(iv) a Nigerian court hearing in the proceedings brought

<<<

 by certain Group companies against WAV and Guaranty Trust Bank pic ("GTB") over a collateralized account at GTB was scheduled to take place on 18 January 2018, but notice was given that the presiding judge was transferred to a different court

<<<

. As such, a new presiding judge is expected to be appointed imminently and a new hearing date scheduled;
(v) various Group companies have commenced arbitration proceedings in London aimed at recovering certain vessels owned by the Group that

<<<

 are currently held by WAV. The arbitrator gave WAV a deadline of 11 January 2018 to appear and file its defence in the arbitration, which WAV failed to meet. The arbitration is now expected to proceed in line with the timetable set by the arbitrator

<<<

. A one day hearing in this arbitration has been set for 19 April 2018. The hearing will take place in London; and
(vi) in addition to the arbitration proceedings referenced above, Group companies have commenced arbitration proceedings in London

<<<

 aimed at recovering certain vessels owned by the Group that were formerly held by WAV under bareboat charter agreements that have since been terminated or expired. A one day hearing on this arbitration has been set for 11 April 2018. The hearing

<<<

 will take place in London.
3. PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING
In conjunction with the Bond Trustee, who is advised by Akin Gump LLP and Houlihan Lokey, and an ad hoc committee of Bondholders and STG Bondholders (the "Ad-hoc Committee"), the Liquidators

<<<

 and the Current Directors have devised a proposal for the restructuring of the Group, as more particularly described herein and in the notice for a written resolution of the STG Bondholders dated on or around the date hereof (the "Restructuring

<<<

" and the "STG Summons").
In broad terms, the Restructuring would involve the sale of the DP3 fleet (excluding the Jascon 30) and business to a newly incorporated group of companies owned by the STG Bondholders. The STG Bondholders will exchange

<<<

 their STG Bonds for (i) shares in the new holding company which would acquire the DP3 fleet (excluding the Jascon 30) and business, and (ii) senior secured bonds issued by a direct subsidiary of that new holding company. Unlike the STG Bondholders

<<<

, Bondholders will not receive shares in the holding company which would acquire the DP3 fleet (excluding the Jascon 30) from the Group, but would instead exchange their Bonds for new super senior secured bonds issued by a direct subsidiary

<<<

 of that new holding company. The newly incorporated companies are neither successors to, or related to, the existing Group.
This Summons contains the resolutions required to implement the Restructuring.
Bondholders should note that even if

<<<

 the resolution set out in this Summons is approved by the requisite number of Bondholders, the Restructuring will be subject to (i) the requisite number of STG Bondholders also providing their consent to the Restructuring pursuant to the
4

<<<



NORDIC TRUSTEE
STG Summons, and (ii) none of the Transferring Companies (as defined below) having entered into any insolvency procedure (or any analogous proceeding in any jurisdiction), whether voluntary or involuntary, without the prior

<<<

 written approval of the Bond Trustee.
In order to properly understand the terms of the Restructuring, it is recommended that Bondholders also read the schedules appended to this Summons in full.
3.1 Overview of the Restructuring Steps
In contemplation

<<<

 of the Restructuring, a special purpose vehicle, Telford Offshore Holdings Limited ("TOHL"), has been incorporated in the Cayman Islands under the instruction of the Bond Trustee. TOHL was incorporated with share capital comprising one ordinary

<<<

 share with a nominal value of USD 1.00 (the "Original Subscriber Share"), which, as at the date of this Summons, is held by Estera Trust (Cayman) Limited ("Estera Trust") for charitable purposes pursuant to a Cayman law governed declaration

<<<

 of trust. Various direct and indirect subsidiaries of TOHL have also been incorporated in the Cayman Islands in order to facilitate the acquisition of the DP3 fleet (excluding the Jascon 30) and business. TOHL and its direct and indirect subsidiaries

<<<

 are referred to herein collectively as the "NewCo Group".
In summary, pursuant to the Restructuring, it is proposed that:
(i) fixed charge receivers will be appointed by the STG Bond Trustee to the members of the Group which own the Jascon

<<<

 25, the Jascon 31 and the Jascon 34 (the "Vessel Sellers");
(ii) the outstanding STG Bonds (including accrued cash pay interest thereon) will be transferred by the STG Bondholders to a newly incorporated direct subsidiary of TOHL, Telford Offshore

<<<

 Limited ("TOL"), in exchange for (1) new senior secured bonds issued by TOL in an amount of USD 175,000,000 (the "Tranche B Bonds"), and (2) an entitlement to receive 100% of the shares in TOHL;
(iii) one third (1/3) by value of the Outstanding

<<<

 Bonds (after taking into account the redemption price of 105% of par which will be payable on the Bonds) (together with all accrued and unpaid cash pay and payment-in-kind interest thereon) will be repaid by TOL (the "Partial Redemption") in

<<<

 accordance with Clause 10.2 (Call Options) of the Bond Agreement, using a portion of the cash subscription proceeds to be received by TOL from certain subscribers (the "Tranche A1 Bondholders") for new super senior secured bonds to be issued

<<<

 by TOL in an amount of USD 38,000,000 (the "Tranche A1 Bonds"). The balance of the cash subscription proceeds from the issuance of the Tranche A1 Bonds will be used by the NewCo Group for working capital purposes, save that USD 10,000,000 of

<<<

 such cash subscription proceeds will be retained by TOL in a bank account which will be blocked and secured in favour of the security agent under the TOL Bond Agreement (as defined below). The Tranche A1 Bonds will be issued at an original

<<<

 issue discount of 6%. In order to facilitate the Partial Redemption, the Issuer is requesting that the Bondholders waive the requirement set out in Clause 10.2.2 of the Bond Agreement requiring the Issuer to notify the Bond Trustee in writing

<<<

 of any redemption of the Bond Issue in whole or in part, whether by one transaction or separate transactions and whether at any one time
5

NORDIC TRUSTEE

or over a period of time (the "Call Option"), at least ten Business Days prior to the

<<<

 settlement date of such Call Option. The effect of such a resolution being approved is that, subject as follows, the Issuer need not provide the Bond Trustee with any prior notice of the Call Option;

(iv) the remaining two thirds (2/3) by

<<<

 value of the Outstanding Bonds (after taking into account the redemption price of 105% of par which will be payable on the Bonds) (together with all accrued and unpaid cash pay and payment-in-kind interest thereon) will be cancelled in exchange

<<<

 for the issuance by TOL of further new senior secured bonds to the Bondholders (the "Tranche A2 Bonds", and the "Tranche A2 Bondholders", together with the Tranche A1 Bonds and the Tranche A1 Bondholders being the "Tranche A Bonds" and the

<<<

 "Tranche A Bondholders", and the Tranche A Bonds together with the Tranche B Bonds being the "TOL Bonds") (the "Bond Exchange"). The Tranche A2 Bonds will be issued to the Bondholders on a pro rata basis, at an original issue discount of 6

<<<

%;

(v) the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds will be constituted in a single bond agreement and will be delivered to the Bondholders and the STG Bondholders, respectively, via the VPS system. To replicate the existing relationship between

<<<

 the Bonds and the STG Bonds, the Tranche A Bonds will rank senior to the Tranche B Bonds. Both the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds will benefit from the same extensive guarantee and security package;

(vi) each of the DP3s will be sold

<<<

 by the relevant Vessel Seller (acting through its fixed charge receivers) to the NewCo Group;

(vii) in order to provide operational support for the DP3s post-completion of the Restructuring, the Parent (acting through the Liquidators) will

<<<

 also sell the existing DP3 operating business to the NewCo Group. The sale of the existing DP3 operating business to the NewCo Group will be implemented pursuant to a sale by the Parent (acting through the Liquidators) of certain Subsidiaries

<<<

 (the "Transferring Companies");

(viii)

post-completion of the Restructuring, the Parent (in liquidation) will remain the parent company of a corporate group (the "OldCo Group") which will primarily consist of vessel owning entities which

<<<

 hold the OOIM Vessels. The OOIM Vessels vary by type but are generally smaller service vessels operating in Nigeria. With the exception of the Jascon 30, no assets or operational functions which are material to the DP3 business would remain

<<<

 within the OldCo Group; and

(ix) post-completion of the Restructuring, the Liquidators and the OldCo Group (with the support of certain local authorities) will continue with the Actions seeking (among other matters) to repossess the Jascon

<<<

 30 and the OOIM Vessels for the benefit of TOL in its capacity as the sole STG Bondholder and the OldCo Group's secured creditor and will continue with other investigations and potential legal actions in connection with certain historical transactions

<<<

 which the Liquidators believe may have prejudiced Bondholders and the Group. The Restructuring also contemplates certain arrangements being put in place between the NewCo Group and the OldCo Group in

6

NORDIC TRUSTEE
relation to the funding

<<<

 and supervision of the Actions, the ongoing investigations, certain other legal actions and the subsequent wind-down of the OldCo Group.
Additional detail on certain of these steps is provided below.
3.2 Receivership Appointments
In contemplation

<<<

 of the Restructuring, and for the purposes of facilitating the potential award of a commercial contract to the NewCo Group, on 6 November 2017, the STG Bond Trustee received a written instruction from more than 50% of the STG Bondholders to

<<<

 appoint fixed charge receivers over the Jascon 28, being a vessel owned, at that time, by Nemo Enterprises Limited ("Nemo"). Following receipt of this STG Bondholder instruction, on 6 November 2017, Chad Griffin and Simon Kirkhope, both of

<<<

 FTI Consulting LLP, were formally appointed by the STG Bond Trustee as joint fixed charge receivers over the Jascon 28 (the "Jascon 28 Receivers") and on that same date, Nemo (acting through the Jascon 28 Receivers) sold the Jascon 28 to Telford

<<<

 28 Limited, an indirect subsidiary of TOHL and TOL, pursuant to the terms of a sale and purchase agreement entered into between Nemo, the Jascon 28 Receivers, TOL and Telford 28 Limited (the "J28 SPA"). The consideration for the sale of the

<<<

 Jascon 28 was deferred. Please see section 3.6 below for further details as to when this consideration will be payable.
As explained above and in the STG Summons, it is proposed that the STG Bond Trustee will also appoint joint fixed charge

<<<

 receivers over the DP3 vessels owned by each of the other Vessel Sellers (the "Receivers"). The appointment of the Receivers is a preliminary step aimed at ultimately facilitating a sale of the remaining DP3s by the Vessel Sellers to the NewCo

<<<

 Group (see sections 3.3 and 3.6 below for further details).
3.3 Signing of SPA
Following the appointment of the Receivers, a sale and purchase agreement (the "SPA") would be signed by the Parent, the Liquidators, the Receivers, certain Subsidiaries

<<<

 and certain entities within the NewCo Group, pursuant to which:
(i) the Vessel Sellers (acting through the Receivers) would sell each of the DP3s (other than the Jascon 28, which has already been sold to the NewCo Group on 6 November 2017 pursuant

<<<

 to the terms of the J28 SPA) to the NewCo Group (the "Vessel Sales"); and
(ii) the Parent (acting through the Liquidators) would sell the DP3 operating business to the NewCo Group (the "Non-Vessel Sale" and together with each of the Vessel

<<<

 Sales, the "Asset Sales").
As is usual in the case of sales of assets owned by companies in insolvency proceedings, the SPA would contain no representations and warranties as to title or other matters in relation to the Asset Sales. Further

<<<

 details on the Asset Sales are contained at section 3.6 below.
The consideration for the Vessel Sales and the sale of the Jascon 28 (being (i) a partial release of STGL's obligations to TOL to repay amounts due under the outstanding STG Bonds

<<<

 in an
7

NORDIC TRUSTEE
amount equal to USD 215,000,000 and (ii) a release of each Vessel Seller from the limited recourse covenant to pay which it has given in respect of the Bonds under the relevant existing security documents), and part

<<<

 of the consideration for the Non-Vessel Sale (being a release of the Issuer from its obligations in respect of the Outstanding Bonds) will, in each case, will be deferred until such time as, respectively, TOL acquires all of the outstanding

<<<

 STG Bonds pursuant to the Bond Claims Transfer (see section 3.4(i) below) and all of the Outstanding Bonds are repaid in cash or in kind in accordance with the transaction documents relating to the Restructuring.
3.4 Bonds to be transferred

<<<

 to TOL in consideration for new bonds issued by TOL
(i) Transfer o f Bonds
All of the outstanding STG Bonds will be acquired by TOL such that it becomes the sole STG Bondholder (the "Bond Claims Transfer"). The outstanding STG Bonds will then

<<<

 be deposited in a VPS account in the name of NT Services AS as security for TOL's obligations under the TOL Bond Agreement. As described below, an amount of USD 215,000,000 in respect of the outstanding STG Bonds will subsequently be cancelled

<<<

 pursuant to the Vessel Sales and the sale of the Jascon 28.
(ii) TOHL Share Issuance
In consideration for the Bond Claims Transfer, STG Bondholders will be entitled to receive their pro rata entitlement to (a) Tranche B Bonds (see section 

<<<

3.4(iii) below); and (b) 100% of the equity in TOHL.
TOHL will issue up to 10,000,000 new ordinary shares to the STG Bondholders (the "TOHL Shares"). Following the issuance of the TOHL Shares, TOHL will cancel the Original Subscriber Share which

<<<

 was issued to, and is currently held by, Estera Trust. Each STG Bondholder shall be entitled to receive approximately one TOHL Share for every USD 45.60611 principal amount of Bonds it holds as at 9am Oslo time on Friday 9 February 2018 (the

<<<

 "Record Date").
(iii) TOL Bond Issuance
In consideration for the Bond Claims Transfer, the STG Bondholders will also receive the Tranche B Bonds, issued by TOL in an aggregate principal amount of USD 175,000,000 on Monday 12 February 2018 

<<<

(the "Completion Date"). The Tranche B Bonds will be issued to the STG Bondholders pro rata to the principal amount of their outstanding STG Bonds.
Furthermore, one third (1/3) by value of the Outstanding Bonds on closing (after taking into

<<<

 account the redemption price of 105% of par which is payable on the Bonds) (together with all accrued and unpaid cash pay and payment-in-kind interest thereon) will be repaid from the cash subscription proceeds received by TOL in respect of

<<<

 the Tranche A1 Bond issuance. The remaining two thirds (2/3) by value of the Outstanding Bonds on closing (after taking into account the redemption price of 105% of par which is payable on the Bonds) (together with all accrued and unpaid cash

<<<

 pay and payment-in-kind interest thereon) will be exchanged for the Tranche A2 Bonds. The Tranche A2 Bonds will be issued to the
8

NORDIC TRUSTEE
Bondholders on a pro rata basis, at an original issue discount of 6%. The holders of the Tranche

<<<

 A1 Bonds will benefit from certain protections against fundamental changes being made to the terms of the Tranche A1 Bonds. Likewise, holders of the Tranche A2 Bonds will benefit from certain protections against fundamental changes being made

<<<

 to the terms of the Tranche A2 Bonds. Otherwise, the Tranche A1 Bonds and the Tranche A2 Bonds will be issued on exactly the same terms.
The Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds will be constituted in a single bond agreement (the "TOL Bond

<<<

 Agreement") to be entered into by TOL (as issuer) and Nordic Trustee AS in its capacity as bond trustee for the TOL Bonds (the "TOL Bond Trustee"). A copy of the TOL Bond Agreement is appended hereto at Schedule 3.
Irrevocable instructions

<<<

 to issue the Tranche A2 Bonds will be delivered to the Securities Depository on the date of signing the TOL Bond Agreement, following which the Tranche A2 Bonds will automatically be delivered to Bondholders shortly after the Completion Date

<<<

 through the Securities Depository.
Certain provisions of the TOL Bond Agreement are based on the Bond Agreement. However, a number of amendments have been made to take account of the NewCo Group's anticipated business plan and requirements

<<<

. For example, the existing voting and enforcement provisions set out in the Bond Agreement will be amended in the TOL Bond Agreement to provide for three separate "enforcement periods", as follows:
(a) Period 1: during the first 90 days after

<<<

 the occurrence of an event of default arising from a payment default, or during the first 120 days in the case of any other event of default, only the Tranche B Bondholders (acting by Tranche B Bondholders representing at least a simple majority

<<<

 of the Tranche B Bonds which are "Voting Bonds" (as defined in the TOL Bond Agreement) and are represented at a Bondholders' Meeting or vote on a Written Resolution) will be entitled to provide enforcement instructions to the TOL Bond Trustee

<<<

 under the TOL Bond Agreement;
(b) Period 2: following the expiry of Period 1 above and for the remainder of the 12 months after the occurrence of the relevant event of default, the Tranche A Bondholders and the Tranche B Bondholders (acting

<<<

 by Tranche A Bondholders and Tranche B Bondholders who together represent at least a simple majority of "Voting Bonds" (as defined in the TOL Bond Agreement) and are represented at a Bondholders' Meeting or vote on a Written Resolution) will

<<<

 be entitled to provide enforcement instructions to the TOL Bond Trustee under the TOL Bond Agreement; and
(c) Period 3: following the expiry of Period 2 above and at all times thereafter, only Tranche A Bondholders (acting by Tranche A Bondholders

<<<

 representing at least a simple majority of the Tranche A Bonds which are "Voting Bonds" (as defined in the TOL Bond Agreement) and are represented at a Bondholders' Meeting or vote on a Written Resolution) will be entitled to provide enforcement

<<<

 instructions to the TOL Bond Trustee under the TOL Bond Agreement.
9

NORDIC TRUSTEE
Following the partial repayment of one third (1/3) by value of the Outstanding Bonds (after taking into account the redemption price of 105% of par which

<<<

 is payable on the Bonds) (together with all accrued and unpaid cash pay and payment-in-kind interest thereon), USD 10,000,000 of the remaining balance of the cash subscription proceeds for the Tranche A1 Bonds will be retained by NT Services

<<<

 AS (in its capacity as escrow manager) in an escrow account until such time as a new bank account is established in TOL's name which is blocked and secured in favour of, and to the satisfaction of, the security agent under the TOL Bond Agreement

<<<

. Once the USD 10,000,000 is transferred to that blocked bank account, the TOL Bond Trustee may release cash back to TOL from that account from time to time on the instruction of holders of a simple majority of the Tranche A Bonds. The balance

<<<

 of the blocked account from time to time would also be included in the calculation of the NewCo Group's cash for the purposes of the cash sweep provisions set out in the TOL Bond Agreement. In the event that a cash sweep payment is required

<<<

 to be made at any time under the TOL Bond Agreement while cash remains in the blocked account, the cash sweep payment will be made by the TOL Bond Trustee to the Tranche A Bondholders first from the monies held in the blocked account, and only

<<<

 secondly from the free cash available to the NewCo Group. Similarly, any funds standing to the credit of the blocked account at the time of any early or final redemption of the Tranche A Bonds will be applied first in redemption of the Tranche

<<<

 A Bonds, with any undischarged balance of the Tranche A Bonds being funded from the NewCo Group's free cash. However, funds standing to the credit of the blocked account may only be used to fund a call option (i.e. early redemption) in respect

<<<

 of the Tranche A Bonds if the NewCo Group meets the minimum liquidity threshold set out in the TOL Bond Agreement.
(iv) Security and Guaranteesfo r TOL Bonds
The TOL Bonds will be guaranteed on an unconditional and irrevocable basis by TOHL

<<<

 and each of TOL's material direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries from time to time. As outlined in the TOL Bond Agreement, the TOL Bonds will also be secured by, without limitation, the following security interests:
(a) new share security

<<<

 interests over the Cayman incorporated entities within the NewCo Group, other than TOHL;
(b) new bank account pledges over all material bank accounts operated by entities within the NewCo Group, including (once established) the blocked account

<<<

 into which USD 10,000,000 will be paid from the cash subscription proceeds of issuance of the Tranche A1 Bonds and any material existing bank accounts operated by the Transferring Companies which will be acquired by the NewCo Group pursuant

<<<

 to the Non-Vessel Sale;
(c) secondary Gibraltar law governed statutory vessel mortgages in respect of each of the DP3s and an assignment by way of security of insurances in respect of each of the DP3s (the existing Gibraltar law governed statutory

<<<

 vessel mortgages over the DP3s which secure the STG Bonds (which will be held by TOL) will remain in place, but the rights of TOL and the STG Bond Trustee in respect of those vessel mortgages and any related proceeds of enforcement will be

<<<

 subject to the terms of the Subordination Agreement (as defined below in section 3.6));
10

NORDIC TRUSTEE
(d) security over all outstanding intercompany receivables within the NewCo Group, as well as over any receivables due to the NewCo

<<<

 Group from the OldCo Group following completion of the Restructuring that arise under the Funding Agreement (as defined in section 3.6 below);
(e) a Norwegian law governed transfer of title security agreement in respect of the STG Bonds, which

<<<

 will be held in a VPS account by NT Services AS on behalf of NT as security for the TOL Bonds (the claims in respect of the STG Bonds will also be subject to certain terms of the Subordination Agreement);
(f) floating charges over assets of

<<<

 certain members of the NewCo Group; and
(g) if so required by the TOL Bond Trustee, an assignment of any intra group contracts entered into in respect of a secured vessel for a term of at least twelve months.
(v) Future Credit Facilities and

<<<

 Intercreditor Principles
The NewCo Group may in the future need to provide performance bonds, guarantees, and letters of credit to certain commercial counterparties. It is therefore proposed that the TOL Bond Agreement permits the NewCo Group

<<<

 to enter into one or more facilities which allow for the provision of performance bonds, guarantees, and letters of credit to commercial counterparties (the "Bonding Line"). The amount of funding which may be incurred from time to time under

<<<

 the Bonding Line will be capped at USD 20,000,000. The TOL Bond Agreement will provide that the Bonding Line may rank either pari passu with the Tranche A Bonds but senior to the Tranche B Bonds, or senior to both the Tranche A Bonds and the

<<<

 Tranche B Bonds and, in both cases, will share the security which is to be granted for the TOL Bonds.
In addition, it is proposed that the TOL Bond Agreement should allow the NewCo Group to enter into a new term loan facility or revolving loan

<<<

 facility provided that (X) all amounts borrowed thereunder must be applied in repayment of all outstanding principal amounts with respect to the Tranche A Bonds, and (Y) the economic terms of the loan to be made thereunder are not more favourable

<<<

 to the lender(s) thereunder than the terms of the Tranche A Bonds immediately before they are repaid (the "Refinancing Facility", and together with the Bonding Line, the "Credit Facilities", each being a "Credit Facility"). Any Refinancing

<<<

 Facility will rank senior to the Tranche B Bonds, in place of the Tranche A Bonds. The Refinancing Facility may itself be refinanced and the amount of funding which may be incurred under any such refinanced Refinancing Facility shall be capped

<<<

 at an amount equal to the principal amount of the Refinancing Facility at the time it is refinanced.
If a Credit Facility is entered into, the Credit Facility Providers will share in the same security package that the Tranche A Bondholders

<<<

 and the Tranche B Bondholders will benefit from, pursuant to the terms of the trust declared by Nordic Trustee AS as the security agent (the "Security Agent") under an English law security trust deed (the "Security Trust Deed"). The Credit

<<<

 Facility(ies) will also be permitted to receive the benefit of guarantees from the
11

NORDIC TRUSTEE
members of the NewCo Group which guarantee the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds.
The TOL Bond Agreement will also include certain

<<<

 intercreditor principles (see schedule 3 of the attached copy o f the TOL Bond Agreement) (the "Intercreditor Principles") and permit the NewCo Group and the TOL Bond Trustee to agree and enter into an intercreditor agreement with the providers

<<<

 of any Credit Facility that is entered into, without further approval from the TOL Bondholders, provided that it complies in all material respects with the constraints set out in the Intercreditor Principles (the "Intercreditor Agreement")

<<<

. The Intercreditor Principles will provide for the Bonding Line to rank either pari passu with the Tranche A Bonds but senior to the Tranche B Bonds, or senior to both the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds. The Intercreditor Principles

<<<

 will also permit a Refinancing Facility to rank senior to the Tranche B Bonds, in place of the Tranche A Bonds. Any intercreditor arrangements which do not comply with the Intercreditor Principles would require further TOL Bondholder approval

<<<

.
Until such time as a Credit Facility has been entered into, the distribution of any proceeds of enforcement o f the security interests under the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds will be governed by the priorities of payment contained

<<<

 in the TOL Bond Agreement, which will provide that the Tranche A Bonds rank senior to the Tranche B Bonds. However, once a Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement is in place, the application of proceeds from any enforcement between

<<<

 the Tranche A Bondholders, the Tranche B Bondholders and the Credit Facility provider(s) will be governed by the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Intercreditor Principles propose that the enforcement rights under the Intercreditor Agreement should

<<<

 broadly mirror the TOL Bond Agreement vis a vis the Tranche A Bondholders and the Tranche B Bondholders (as described above in para 3.4(iii) above), except that the Credit Facility providers shall be entitled to vote alongside the Tranche A

<<<

 Bondholders. Accordingly, the Intercreditor Principles provide that (a) during Period 2, secured creditors (i.e. the Tranche A Bondholders, the Tranche B Bondholders, and all Credit Facility providers) representing more than 50.00 per cent

<<<

, of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the TOL Bond Agreement and the Credit Facility(ies) will vote together in relation to the provision of any enforcement instructions to the Security Agent, and (b) following the expiry of

<<<

 Period 2 and at all times thereafter, Tranche A Bondholders and Credit Facility providers (irrespective of whether the Bonding Facility (if any) ranks senior to the Tranche A Bonds or pari passu to the Tranche A Bonds) together representing

<<<

 more than 50.00 per cent, of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Tranche A Bonds and the Credit Facility(ies) will vote together in relation to the provision of any enforcement instructions to the Security Agent.
(vi) Receipt

<<<

 o f TOL Bonds
Bondholders will, without any further action required on their part, receive their pro rata allocation of Tranche A2 Bonds shortly after the Completion Date. Pursuant to Clause 18.4.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Bond Trustee has

<<<

 access to the Securities Depository for the purposes of reviewing the ownership of the Bonds registered in the Securities Depository in order that it may carry out its functions and obligations under the Bond Agreement. The Bond
12

NORDIC

<<<

 TRUSTEE
Trustee shall be given authority by Bondholders for the aforementioned authorisation to apply in respect of the issuance of the Tranche A2 Bonds to Bondholders by TOL (the "Securities Depository Authorisation").
The TOL Bonds have not

<<<

 been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act") or under the laws of any state or territory of the United States, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption from the registration

<<<

 requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The TOL Bonds issued in the United States will be "restricted securities" (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act). The TOL Bonds may not be reoffered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred

<<<

, except:
(a) to the issuer of the relevant TOL Bonds;
(b) to a person whom the Bondholder and/or any person acting on its behalf reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A (as defined in section 8 below

<<<

);
(c) in an "offshore transaction" in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act;
(d) in accordance with Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act (if available);
(e) pursuant to any other exemption from, or in a transaction not

<<<

 subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act; or
(f) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state or territory

<<<

 of the United States or any other jurisdiction.
This Summons does not constitute a financial promotion for the purposes of section 21 of the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
3.5 Release of Intercompany Claims
In order

<<<

 to facilitate the Restructuring, pursuant to certain deeds of settlement and release entered into between various entities within the Group (the "Claims Release Agreements"), certain intercompany claims between members of the Group will be

<<<

 assigned, set-off or released, such that most of the claims between entities within the OldCo Group and the Transferring Companies will be released. Accordingly, the principal outstanding debt that will exist between the NewCo Group and the

<<<

 OldCo Group post-completion of the Restructuring will be the STG Bonds and any future debt incurred pursuant to the Funding Agreement (as defined in section 3.6 below). The STG Bond Trustee will enter into a deed of release to release its security

<<<

 interests over any intercompany claims which are currently secured in its favour if and to the extent only that they are to be the subject of the Claims Release Agreements in connection with the completion of the Non-Vessel Sale.
3.6 Consideration

<<<

 for Asset Sales
13

NORDIC TRUSTEE
Consideration for the Vessel Sales and the sale of the Jascon 28 will take the form of (i) a release of each Vessel Seller from the limited recourse covenant to pay which it has given in respect of the STG

<<<

 Bonds under the relevant existing security documents; and (ii) a partial release of amounts in respect of the STG Bonds (the Outstanding Bonds being held by, at the relevant time, TOL) in an amount equal to USD 215,000,000.
Consideration for

<<<

 the Non-Vessel Sale will take the form of (i) a full release of TOL's claim against the Issuer following (1) TOL's repayment of one-third (1/3) by value of the Outstanding Bonds (after taking into account the redemption price of 105% of par

<<<

 which is payable on the Bonds) (together with all accrued and unpaid cash pay and payment-in-kind interest thereon) from a portion of the cash subscription proceeds to be received from the Tranche A1 Bondholders in respect of the Tranche A

<<<

1 Bond issuance, and (2) TOL's assumption of the Issuer's remaining liabilities under the Outstanding Bonds (after taking into account the redemption price of 105% of par which is payable on the Bonds) (together with all accrued and unpaid cash

<<<

 pay and payment-in-kind interest thereon) pursuant to TOL's issuance of the Tranche A2 Bonds to the Bondholders; (ii) TOL's entry into a management services agreement with STG and the Liquidators pursuant to which TOL shall provide (or procure

<<<

 the provision of) certain management services to the OldCo Group post-completion of the Restructuring (the Non-Vessel Sale operating as a good discharge of any obligation of the Issuer to pay the fees payable under that agreement for the first

<<<

 two years after it comes into force); and (iii) TOL's entry into a funding agreement with members of the OldCo Group (including STG) pursuant to which TOL shall agree to provide on-going funding to the OldCo Group in respect of certain costs

<<<

 and expenses of the OldCo Group post-completion of the Restructuring on the terms set out in that funding agreement (the "Funding Agreement").
The STG Bond Trustee's existing share security interests in relation to the assets which are subject

<<<

 to the Non-Vessel Sale will also be released by the STG Bond Trustee pursuant to the STG Bond Trustee entering into one or more deeds of release in favour of the Issuer. Pursuant to the terms of a subordination agreement entered into between

<<<

 TOL, the STG Bond Trustee and the TOL Bond Trustee, the TOL Bond Trustee shall have the right, amongst other things, to give any instructions in relation to the enforcement or release of the existing first ranking Gibraltar law governed statutory

<<<

 vessel mortgages over the DP3s, and to receive the proceeds o f any sale of the DP3s (the "Subordination Agreement").
As explained at section 3.3 above, the consideration for the Vessel Sales and the sale of the Jascon 28 which took place on

<<<

 6 November 2017 pursuant to the J28 SPA and part of the consideration for the Non-Vessel Sale will be deferred until such time as the Bond Claims Transfer has been completed in the VPS system and the Outstanding Bonds have been partially repaid

<<<

 in cash, and the balance of the Outstanding Bonds has been exchanged for Tranche A2 Bonds through the VPS system.
3.7 Release
In order to facilitate, and with effect from the completion of, the Restructuring, the Bond Trustee will also agree

<<<

 to waive any breach of any provision of the Finance Documents that would arise as a result only of a member of the Group entering into, or performing its obligations under, any document relating to the Restructuring and will consent to the

<<<

 members of the Group taking such action. The Bond Trustee will not waive any other Events
14

NORDIC TRUSTEE
of Default under the terms of the Bond Agreement which have already occurred or which may occur other than in connection with the

<<<

 implementation of the Restructuring and the Bonds will remain immediately due and payable.

SCHEDULE 2 BUSINESS PLAN

Group Liquidity and NewCo Business Plan
Since 6 October 2017, the Group has been presenting to the Ad-hoc Committee versions of the Business Plan which have reflected updates to commercial circumstances

<<<

. The material financial outputs (the "Outputs") of the most recent update to the Business Plan are shown below in this Schedule.
The Business Plan contains financial projections relating to both: - the NewCo Group, reflecting in HI 2018 the

<<<

 assumed utilization of the 4 DP3 vessels and the
related businesses and operations to be transferred through the Restructuring and thereafter all 5 DP3 vessels; and estimated cash flows assumed to be provided by the NewCo Group to the OldCo

<<<

 Group pursuant to the Ongoing Funding Agreement
The publication of the Outputs should not be regarded as an indication that the Ad-hoc Committee who received the Business Plan, the Group's management, or any other recipient of the Business

<<<

 Plan considered, or now considers, either the Business Plan or the Outputs to be reliable predictions of any future result. Readers of this Summons are cautioned not to, and should not, place undue reliance on any forward-looking aspect of

<<<

 this Summons, any element of the Business Plan or the Outputs or the negotiations which have taken place between the Ad-hoc Committee and the Group. No representations have been, or are being, made to any member of the Ad-hoc Committee regarding

<<<

 the Business Plan or the Outputs. The Group does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Business Plan or the Outputs to reflect circumstances existing or events occurring after the date o f this Summons.
Historical financial information

<<<

 presented in respect of H2 2017 has been extracted from the Group's unaudited management accounts. Financial information in respect of HI 2017 is not presented as the results for the period prior to the appointment of the Liquidators remains

2. Proceeds from financing in H2 2017 consists of the receipt of funds from the Liquidity Bond, US$5m of which was received

 in early July 2017.
3. Pursuant to a standstill letter received by STIL from Nordic Trustee AS, acting in its capacity as bond trustee for the Liquidity Bonds, STIL did not make or procure the repayment due to be made on the Liquidity Bonds

<<<

 on 23 December 2017. The interest payment due on 23 December 2017 in respect of the Liquidity Bonds was made consistent with the terms of the Liquidity Bonds.
4. The free cash balance at 31 December 2017 reflects the free cash balance at the

 Group, prior to the implementation of the Restructuring.
5. NewCo Exceptional Costs in 2018 relate to the residual costs associated with the implementation of the Restructuring and operational restructuring.
6. The Business Plan assumes future

<<<

 interest payments on the TOL Bonds are made as scheduled.
7. Financing proceeds comprises the net additional liquidity provided to the NewCo Group from the issuance of the new Tranche A1 Bonds and the release of US$ 2.1m from a blocked account

<<<

 held by the Bond Trustee into which funds in the DSRA and another Group account were swept. The Tranche A 1 Bonds provide net additional liquidity of US$ 25.7m (including the US$ 1lm to be held in two blocked accounts pledged to the holders

<<<

 of the TOL Bonds) after taking account of the discount on issue and the application of approximately US$ 10m o f the net proceeds in partial repayment of the Liquidity Bonds.
8. The NewCo Group net change in free cash in 2018, the free cash

<<<

 balance at 31 December 2018 and the minimum free cash balance for 2018 assume that the full US$ 11m of blocked cash pledged to the holders o f the TOL Bonds is released to the NewCo Group, but does not reflect the possible receipt of approximately

<<<

 US$ 9m due from a client, payment/release of which remains uncertain at the date of this Summons.
9. In its Notice of a Written Bondholders' Resolution dated 15 June 2017, the Group notified the Bondholders of the material financial outputs

<<<

 of business plans developed prior to that date, including in respect o f the years 2019 - 2021 inclusive. There have been no material updates to those business plans, which were based on, inter alia, market research conducted prior to that

<<<

 date. The Group notes that continuing uncertainty around the outcome of the Actions, along with potential developments in market conditions for the oil & gas services industry, are likely to impact both the assumptions made in and outputs derived

<<<

 from any business plan relating to those years.
