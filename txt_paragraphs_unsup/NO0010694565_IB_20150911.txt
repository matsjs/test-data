To the Bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001 069456.5: 7.75 per cent. World Wide Supply AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2017
INFORMATION TO BONDHOLDERS: MINIMUM LIQUIDITY
As of 31 August 2015 the Issuer is below the minimum liquidity

<<<

 set out in the Bond Agreement Clause 14.11 (c). The available liquidity was USD 5,590,000 while the requirement is USD 7,500,000 (USD 1,250,000 X 6). This temporary liquidity shortfall in August is caused by the present blocking o f two o f

<<<

 the four vessels on contract with Petrobras and the resulting lack o f payment from Petrobras. The vessels remain entitled to charter-hire, but this is withheld until the blocking situation is resolved. The two other vessels in Brazil have

<<<

 their CAA (Certificate of Charter Authorization) renewed until, respectively, June and August 2016, and are working as normal with hire being paid on time.
The liquidity forecast for the Issuer for the period August to December 2015 shows that

<<<

 the Issuer will have sufficient liquidity to carry out its business. It may, however, at times be below the minimum liquidity requirement. As per 31 December 2015 the liquidity is estimated to be USD 6.7 million. The forecast is based on the

<<<

 contractual day rate per vessel and the historical utilization for all four vessels working in Brazil (Petrobras), hereunder an expected end of the present blocking of the two vessels before October 2015, and that all outstanding payments from

<<<

 Petrobras are made within September/October. The two vessels located in the North Sea will be laid up as of 1 September and 16 September respectively, which will require less available liquidity to conduct the Issuer's business compared to

<<<

 a situation where all the Issuer's vessels are operating.
The board of directors monitors the development of the liquidity situation carefully and is pursuing all available options to mitigate the liquidity situation. Hereunder the Issuer has

<<<

 retained financial and legal advisers (Pareto Securities and the lawfirm Selmer) to assist the Issuer in the current situation.
Yours sincerely WORLD WIDE SUPPLY AS
