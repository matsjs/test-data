 Bond Issue 2013/2018

Oslo, 15 June 2017
Notice of a Written Bondholders' Resolution
1. INTRODUCTION
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue

<<<

 (the "Bond Issue" or the "Bonds"), in respect of which Sea Trucks Group Limited (in liquidation) is the Issuer (the "Issuer", and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group").
Unless otherwise stated herein, all capitalised terms used but not

<<<

 otherwise defined in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Bond Issue originally dated 25 March 2013, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Bond Agreement").
References

<<<

 to "Clauses" in this Summons are references to clauses in the Bond Agreement.
The Bond Trustee has been in discussions with an `ad hoc' committee of Bondholders who, together, currently hold in excess of 61% of the Voting Bonds (the "Bondholder

<<<

 Committee") with respect to various issues that are described in further detail below.
The information in this Summons regarding the Issuer, market conditions and described transactions is provided to the Bond Trustee and the Bond Trustee expressly

<<<

 disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Appointment of provisional liquidators and liquidators
As was explained in the summons for a Bondholders' Meeting dated 24 April 2017 (the "24 April Summons"

<<<

), various events of default had occurred and were continuing under the Bond Agreement. The proposal set out in the 24 April Summons was passed by Bondholders at the Bondholders' Meeting held on 2 May 2017 (the "2 May Bondholders' Meeting")

<<<

.
Prior to the 2 May Bondholders' Meeting, the Bond Trustee received a written instruction from more than 50% of the Voting Bonds to declare the Bonds due and payable and to file applications in the British Virgin Islands for the liquidation

<<<

 of the Issuer and the interim appointment of provisional liquidators to the Issuer (the "Written Instruction").
On 30 April 2017, pursuant to the terms of the Bond Agreement and in accordance with the Written Instruction, the Bond Trustee declared

<<<

 the Outstanding Bonds (including accrued interest, costs and expenses) to be in default and due for immediate payment in an aggregate amount of USD 481,727,037. On 1 May 2017, the Issuer confirmed to the Bond Trustee that it was unable to repay

<<<

 the Outstanding Bonds and had concluded that it was unable to continue to operate as a going concern. The Bond Trustee then applied to the Commercial Division of the High Court of Justice
1

NORDIC TRUSTEE
British Virgin Islands of the Eastern

<<<

 Caribbean Supreme Court for the appointment of provisional liquidators to the Issuer. In light of the Issuer's inability to repay the Outstanding Bonds which are now due and payable in full and its conclusion that it was unable to continue

<<<

 to operate as a going concern, and given further the Bond Trustee's express wish for the appointment of provisional liquidators, the Issuer provided its consent to the appointment of provisional liquidators. The 2 May Bondholders' Meeting ratified

<<<

 the action which had been taken by the Bond Trustee to accelerate the Bonds and seek the appointment of provisional liquidators to the Issuer.
Pursuant to orders of the Commercial Division of the High Court of Justice British Virgin Islands

<<<

 of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, Mr Chad Griffin of FTI Consulting LLP and Mr Ian Morton of FTI Consulting (BVI) Limited were appointed as joint and several provisional liquidators of the Issuer On 5 May 2017 and as joint and several

<<<

 liquidators of the Issuer on 12 June 2017 (the "Liquidators").
2.2 Blocking of and transfers from bank accounts
On 26 April 2017, the Bond Trustee received a written instruction from more than 50% of the Voting Bonds to block the bank account

<<<

 held with Rabobank by Sea Trucks Offshore Limited ("STOL") pursuant to the terms of an account pledge granted in favour of the Bond Trustee. The Bond Trustee issued the instruction to Rabobank to block the STOL bank account. Following the receipt

<<<

 of a further written instruction from more than 50% of the Voting Bonds on 30 April 2017, the Bond Trustee issued an instruction to Rabobank to transfer the entire balance held at the time in the STOL bank account (being EUR 1,555.07 and USD

<<<

 1,613,395.10) to a bank account in the name of the Bond Trustee, as security for the future costs and expenses of the Bond Trustee. On 8 June 2017, the Bond Trustee instructed Rabobank to unblock the STOL bank account and it is now available

<<<

 to STOL.
On 2 May 2017, in accordance with a written instruction from more than 50% of the Voting Bonds, the Bond Trustee instructed DNB Bank (as account bank) to transfer the entire balance held at the time in the Debt Service Retention Account

<<<

 ("DSRA") (being USD 512.210.05) into a bank account in the name of the Bond Trustee, as security for the future costs and expenses of the Bond Trustee. Under the terms of the Bond Agr eement and the DSRA account pledge, the DSRA was blocked

<<<

 in favour of the Bond Trustee prior to such transfer being made.
3. ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT
As outlined in their announcement of 8 May 2017, the Liquidators have been working with management and investigating the affairs of the Issuer

<<<

, the activities of the prior directors and the broader Group. The Liquidators and the directors have determined that it would be prudent to seek a further funding from Bondholders to provide additional working capital to the Group in an amount

<<<

 of USD 25,000,000 (the "Additional Liquidity"). On 7 June 2017, the Issuer published a notice to Bondholders (the "Notice"), informing them that the Issuer was considering issuing bonds in an amount of USD 25,000,000 to meet the Group's need

<<<

 for Additional Liquidity. The Notice invited any Bondholder who wished to receive further information about the potential bond issue to inform Arctic Securities ASA (the "Broker"), and provide proof of its holdings, on or before 17:00 CET on

<<<

 13 June 2017 (the "Deadline").
All Bondholders who responded to the Notice before the Deadline will be offered the opportunity to provide the Additional Liquidity on the basis set out below. In the event that none of the Bondholders outside

<<<

 the Bondholder Committee elect to participate, it is anticipated that the members of the Bondholder Committee will provide the Additional Liquidity in full.
The rationale for the Additional Liquidity is that Group's base case short term cash

<<<

 flow forecast shows too little headroom and potential uncertainty around the timing of certain cash flows. As such
2

NORDIC TRUSTEE
it is deemed prudent to raise the Additional Liquidity to provide increased working capital to support the

<<<

 Group. Sensitised cash flow forecasts have been prepared on a downside scenario through to 31 December 2017 to estimate the size of the Additional Liquidity and the appropriate repayment profile.
Appendix 2 contains the material financial outputs

<<<

 from both the Group's base and sensitised short term cash flow forecast, showing the high and low liquidity points pro-forma for raising of the Additional Liquidity.
The directors of the Issuer's subsidiaries continue to manage the Group's

<<<

 liquidity position carefully and the Liquidators monitor short term liquidity forecasts, discussing the position with the Bond Trustee's financial advisors on a regular basis.
4. DP3 BUSINESS PLAN
To provide some context to the Additional Liquidity

<<<

 request, the Group is providing some guidance on its business plan. Management have been developing business plans for the Group's key commercial activities, taking into account the recent financial performance, market conditions, backlog and

<<<

 contract tenders. The initial focus has been on a business plan concept relating to the five DP3-capable vessels (the Jascon 25, Jascon 28, Jascon 30, Jascon 31 and Jascon 34; together the "DP3 Division") (the "DP3 Business Plan").
The vessels

<<<

 within the DP3 Division are secured in favour of the Bond Trustee as collateral for the Bonds. They contribute the majority of the gross asset value of the Group and have potential for deployment in multiple markets for oil and gas services

<<<

.
In developing the DP3 Business Plan, the Group has made a number of assumptions about future oil prices, growth rates for relevant expenditure programmes of the Group's potential clients, and the Group's competitive positioning in bidding

<<<

 for potential future business. Scenarios considered included both stronger and weaker market conditions and performance by the Group, resulting in "High Case" and "Low Case" outputs respectively.
Appendix 3 contains the material financial outputs

<<<

 from the DP3 Business Plan. The publication of these outputs should not be regarded as a reliable prediction of any future result. Bondholders should not place undue reliance on any aspect of the DP3 Business Plan and no representations have

<<<

 been made regarding the DP3 Business Plan.
Work is ongoing in relation to the business plan for the Group's other activities, being the Other Offshore and Inland Marine Support Services (or OOIM) division which operates in Nigeria. The majority

<<<

 of the OOIM fleet is secured in favour of the Bond Trustee.
5. RESTRUCTURING
The Liquidators are in discussions with the Group's key stakeholders on a range of alternative restructuring options. To establish valuations and available realisation

<<<

 options, the Liquidators have instructed brokers to undertake desk top vessel valuations and undertake market testing in respect of the DP3 Division.
6. TERMS OF THE LIQUIDITY BONDS
To meet the Additional Liquidity, it is proposed that Sea

<<<

 Trucks International Limited ("STIL"), an immediate subsidiary of the Issuer, would issue bonds under a new Norwegian law bond agreement (the "Liquidity Bonds"). STIL is an entity incorporated under Guernsey law, and is the legal owner of the

<<<

 shares in each of the Group's subsidiaries which own the vessels mortgaged in favour of the
3

NORDIC TRUSTEE
Bond Trustee (including the DP3 Division). Each Bondholder who duly responded to the Notice before the Deadline will have the right

<<<

 to subscribe for the Liquidity Bonds pursuant to the subscription process set out in section 8 of this Summons. Any Bondholder who failed to respond to the Notice before the Deadline will not have the right to subscribe for the Liquidity Bonds

<<<

. STIL has appointed the Broker to act as its broker in connection with the issuance of the Liquidity Bonds.
The Liquidity Bonds will be issued on the terms set out in the funding term sheet attached at Appendix 1 (the "Term Sheet"). The Liquidity

<<<

 Bonds issued in the Initial Funding Allocation (as defined below) will be issued at an original issuance discount equal to 8 per cent, of their face or nominal value. Any Liquidity Bonds issued in the Overage Funding Allocation (as defined

<<<

 below) will be issued at an original issuance discount equal to 10 per cent, of their face or nominal value. The Liquidity Bonds will mature on the date falling one year after the Settlement Date, with a single interim amortisation payment

<<<

 in an amount of 50 per cent, of the aggregate principal amount of the Liquidity Bonds on issuance, payable on the date falling six months after the Settlement Date. They will accrue cash interest at a rate of 9% per annum which will be payable

<<<

 on a quarterly basis. They will also accrue PIK interest at a rate of 5% per annum for the first six months, increasing by a further 5 per cent, every six months thereafter, which will capitalise on a quarterly basis.
The covenants, representations

<<<

 and events of default contained in the new bond agreement which constitutes the Liquidity Bonds (the "Liquidity Bond Agreement") shall be based on the Bond Agreement, but reduced and amended to reflect, inter alia, the fact that STIL (rather

<<<

 than the Issuer) will be the issuer of the Liquidity Bonds and the current financial position of the Group (for example, the only financial covenant in the Liquidity Bond Agreement will be a minimum liquidity covenant). Nordic Trustee ASA will

<<<

 be the trustee for the Liquidity Bonds (the "Liquidity Bond Trustee").
The Liquidity Bonds will not be guaranteed by the Issuer, or any other entity within the Group, but the Issuer will be party to the Liquidity Bond Agreement for the purposes

<<<

 of providing the covenants and undertakings contained in it. The Liquidity Bonds will benefit from security granted in favour of the Liquidity Bond Trustee over the Liquidity Bonds Escrow Account (as defined below) but will not be secured over

<<<

 any other assets of the Group.
As outlined in the Term Sheet, the Issuer, STIL as issuer of the Liquidity Bonds, the Bond Trustee and Liquidity Bond Trustee will enter into an intercreditor agreement in connection with the issuance of the Liquidity

<<<

 Bonds (the "Intercreditor Agreement"). The Term Sheet contains a summary of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that any proceeds received by the Bond Trustee under the terms of the Bond Agreement

<<<

 (including, without limitation, payments of interest, principal or the proceeds of enforcement of collaterals which secures the Bonds) will be applied in discharge of the following liabilities in the following order: (i) the fees, costs and

<<<

 expenses of the Bond Trustee and Liquidity Bond Trustee or which either of them determines (in its sole discretion) that it wishes to retain on account of any present or future liabilities which it may incur in such capacity (including, without

<<<

 limitation, in connection with the enforcement of any security), (ii) all amounts due in respect of the Liquidity Bonds, and (iii) all amounts due in respect of the Bonds. Accordingly, the Liquidity Bonds will have effective seniority on a

<<<

 contractual basis to the Bonds. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are detailed in the Term Sheet.
7. ALLOCATION OF LIQUIDITY BONDS
Each Bondholder who duly responded to the Notice before the Deadline and who wishes to subscribe for the

<<<

 Liquidity Bonds (a "Subscribing Bondholder") will be entitled to do so by payment of a cash subscription amount equal to the product of USD 25,000,000 and the proportion of Bonds held by it as at 13 June 2017 (the "Record Date") and (where

<<<

 relevant) acquired by it from any nonSubscribing Bondholders prior to the end of the Application Period (as defined in the Subscription Form) (the resulting cash subscription amounts of the Subscribing Bondholders being the "Initial Funding

<<<

 Allocations"). The Liquidity Bonds issued pursuant to the Initial Funding Allocations will
4

NORDIC TRUSTEE
be issued at an original issue discount equal to 8 per cent, of their face or nominal value. Therefore, for example, a Subscribing

<<<

 Bondholder with an Initial Funding Allocation of USD 1,000,000 will receive Liquidity Bonds in the Initial Funding Allocation with a face value of USD 1,086,956.
Each Subscribing Bondholder will be required to deliver to the Broker a subscription

<<<

 form in the stipulated form (a "Subscription Form") as outlined in section 8 below. When completing its Subscription Form, a Subscribing Bondholder may also indicate whether it wishes to subscribe for additional Liquidity Bonds, by payment

<<<

 of a cash subscription amount greater than its Initial Funding Allocation. Any such Subscribing Bondholder (the "Overage Bondholders") will be entitled to specify on its Subscription Form the maximum cash subscription amount which it wishes

<<<

 to pay in subscribing for Liquidity Bonds (the "Maximum Requested Allocation").
Following the Subscription Deadline (as defined below), the Broker will calculate the difference (if any) between the aggregate Initial Funding Allocations on the

<<<

 one hand and USD 25,0000,000 on the other (such difference being the "Initial Funding Shortfall"). The Broker will allocate the Initial Funding Shortfall between the Overage Bondholders pro rata (as between themselves) to thenholding of the

<<<

 Bonds as at the Record Date and (where relevant) acquired by it from any nonSubscribing Bondholders prior to the end of the Application Period and, in the event that the aggregate amount of the Initial Funding Allocation plus such further allocation

<<<

 is still less than USD 25.000. 000, the difference shall be allocated between those Overage Bondholders whose Maximum Requested Allocation has not yet been fully utilised, pro rata (as between themselves) to their holdings of Bonds as at the

<<<

 Record Date and (where relevant) acquired by it from any nonSubscribing Bondholders prior to the end of the Application Period) provided however, that the cash subscription amount payable by an Overage Bondholder will in no circumstances exceed

<<<

 its Maximum Requested Allocation as stipulated on its Subscription Form. If the aggregate amount of the Initial Allocation plus such further allocation is still less than USD 25,000,000, the difference shall be allocated between those Overage

<<<

 Bondholders whose Maximum Requested Allocation has not been fully utilised, pro rata (as between themselves) to their holdings of Bonds as at the Record Date and (where relevant) acquired by it from any non-Subscribing Bondholders prior to

<<<

 the end of the Application Period), and so on until the aggregate cash subscription amounts total USD 25.000. 000 (all of the resulting allocations to the Overage Bondholders of the Initial Funding Shortfall being, together, the "Overage Funding

<<<

 Allocations"). The Liquidity Bonds issued pursuant to the Overage Funding Allocations will be issued at an original issue discount equal to 10 per cent, of their face or nominal value. For example, a Subscribing Bondholder with a Overage Funding

<<<

 Allocation of USD 1,000,000 will receive Liquidity Bonds in the Overage Funding Allocation with a face value of USD 1,111,111.
Each Subscribing Bondholder may nominate one or more of its Affiliates to subscribe for Liquidity Bonds on its behalf

<<<

 (which term shall include, in respect of a Bondholder, any other person that is an investment fund or vehicle and which (a) is advised or managed by that Bondholder or its Affiliate, (b) is advised or managed by the same person as that Bondholder

<<<

 or its Affiliate, or (c) advises or manages that Bondholder or its Affiliate).
8. SUBSCRIPTION PROCESS
Bondholders who duly responded to the Notice before the Deadline and who wish to subscribe for Liquidity Bonds should notify the Broker of

<<<

 their interest by sending a request for a Subscription Form by email (seatrucks@arctic.com), together with evidence of their current holdings of the Bonds (specifying the beneficial owner). The deadline for returning a duly completed Subscription

<<<

 Form to the Broker will be 13:00 CET on 21 June 2017 (the "Subscription Deadline"). Any Subscribing Bondholder who returns a Subscription Form to the Broker after the Subscription Deadline will not be entitled to participate in the subscription

<<<

 for, and allocation of, the Liquidity Bonds.
5

NORDIC TRUSTEE
The obligations of each Subscribing Bondholder to subscribe for Liquidity Bonds under the terms of their Subscription Form will be conditional upon the Broker receiving Subscription

<<<

 Forms under which the aggregate amount of the Initial Funding Allocations and (if applicable) Overage Funding Allocations for Liquidity Bonds total USD 25,000,000.
In the event that, prior to the Subscription Deadline, the Broker receives duly

<<<

 completed Subscription Forms from Subscribing Bondholders under which such Subscribing Bondholders have agreed to subscribe for Liquidity Bonds with an aggregate cash subscription amount of at least USD 25,000,0000 and the Proposal (as defined

<<<

 below) has been adopted, and those Subscribing Bondholders hold, in aggregate, at least 40% of the Outstanding Bonds, then the Broker may require each such Subscribing Bondholder, on two Business Days' written notice, to transfer to an escrow

<<<

 account opened in the name of STIL (as issuer of the Liquidity Bonds) which is pledged and blocked in favour of the Liquidity Bond Trustee (the "Liquidity Bond Escrow Account") a cash amount equal to its Initial Funding Allocation based on

<<<

 its holding of Existing Bonds as at the Record Date only (and without taking account for these funding purposes only any Existing Bonds acquired by it from non-Subscribing Bondholders during the Application Period) (the "First Stage Funding

<<<

"). In such circumstances, STIL (as issuer of the Liquidity Bonds) will issue to each such Subscribing Bondholder Liquidity Bonds with an initial face value equal to such Subscribing Bondholder's Initial Funding Allocation based on its holding

<<<

 of Existing Bonds as at the Record Date only (and without taking account for these funding purposes only any Existing Bonds acquired by it from nonSubscribing Bondholders during the Application Period) divided by 0.92.
The Broker will, following

<<<

 the Subscription Deadline, calculate the Initial Funding Allocation and (if applicable) the Overage Funding Allocation of each Subscribing Bondholder. Each Subscribing Bondholder will then be required to transfer to the Liquidity Bond Escrow

<<<

 Account, a cash amount equal to (x) its Initial Funding Allocation less any cash subscription amount transferred by it to the Liquidity Bond Escrow Account pursuant to the First Stage Funding plus (y) its Second Funding Allocation (if any)

<<<

 (the "Second Stage Funding"). The Second Stage Funding shall be required to be made by a Subscribing Bondholder within the later of 2 Business Days of (i) the Subscription Deadline, or (ii) the date on which the Broker notifies it of its Initial

<<<

 Funding Allocation and (if applicable) its Overage Funding Allocation.
STIL (as issuer of the Liquidity Bonds) will issue to each Subscribing Bondholder who has participated in the Second Stage Funding, Liquidity Bonds with an initial principal

<<<

 amount equal to (x) its Initial Funding Allocation divided by 0.92, less the principal amount of the Liquidity Bonds (if any) issued to it in the First Stage Funding plus (y) its Overage Funding Allocation (if any) divided by 0.90.
Arctic Securities

<<<

 AS acts solely as broker in respect of the Liquidity Bonds and shall have no liability in respect of any statements or descriptions contained in this Summons and its appendixes. Furtherinformation regarding the Liquidity Bonds and final drafts

<<<

 of the Liquidity Bond Agreement and Intercreditor Agreement shall be available for Bondholders by request to James Terry fiames.terrv@akingump.com) or Emma Simmonds (emma.simmonds@akingump.com).

Each Subscribing Bondholder shall receive an initial allocation of Liquidity Bonds

 equal to its pro rata share of USD 25,000,000 (based on its (or, in the case of an Affiliate of a Subscribing Bondholder which is nominated by that Subscribing Bondholder to receive shares, that Subscribing Bondholder's) holdings of Existing

<<<

 Bonds as at 14 June 2017 and (where relevant) any Existing Bonds acquired by it from any non-Subscribing Bondholders prior to the end of the application period (the "Initial Funding Allocation").
In subscribing for the Liquidity Bonds, each

<<<

 Subscribing Bondholder will indicate whether it wishes to subscribe for Liquidity Bonds in a cash subscription amount greater than its Initial Funding Allocation and, if relevant, the maximum cash subscription amount which it would be willing

<<<

 to pay (the "Maximum Requested Allocation") (such Subscribing Bondholders being the "Overage Bondholders").
In the event that the aggregate amount of the Initial Funding Allocations is less than USD 25,000,000 (the difference between such amounts

<<<

 being the "Excess Amount"), then the Excess Amount shall be allocated between the Overage Bondholders pro rata as between themselves to their holdings of the Existing Bonds; provided however that no Overage Bondholder shall be required to subscribe

<<<

 for more than its Maximum Requested Allocation. If the aggregate amount of the Initial Allocation plus such further allocation is still less than USD 25,000,000, the difference shall be allocated between those Overage Bondholders whose Maximum

<<<

 Requested Allocation has not been fully utilised, pro rata (as between themselves) to their existing holdings of Existing Bonds, and so on until the full USD 25,000,000 is allocated. Allocations so made following the Initial Funding Allocation

 shall be referred to as the "Overage Funding Allocations".
The broker shall not take account of the Original Issuance Discount in making the calculations referred to above.
The Liquidity Bonds will be issued with an Original Issue Discount

. To ensure the Issuer receives a net cash amount (before the deduction of costs and fees as described below), the face value of the Liquidity Bonds issued in consideration for Subscribing Bondholders' cash subscription amounts shall be grossed

 up as described below.
The Liquidity Bonds issued to the Subscribing Bondholders in the Initial Funding Allocation will be issued with an Original Issue Discount equal to 8 per cent, of their face value. Therefore, for example, a Subscribing

 Bondholder with an Initial Funding Allocation of USD 1,000,000 will receive Liquidity Bonds in the Initial Funding Allocation with a face value of USD 1,086,956.
The Liquidity Bonds issued to the Overage Bondholders in the Overage Funding Allocation

Terms and expressions used in this letter shall, unless otherwise defined

Following the appointment on 5 May 2017 of provisional liquidators to the Company, the Company continued development of its business plan and consequent

 forecasts of its cash flow ("Cash Flow Forecasts", and each a "Cash Flow Forecast"). On 25 May 2017, the Company presented to a number of Bondholders (the "Ad Hoc Committee") several Cash Flow Forecasts, each of which was based on certain assumptions

 about cash revenues and expenditure during the remainder of 2017.
The Company's presentation on 25 May 2017 included a request (the "Liquidity Facility Request") for US$ 25m of funding (the "Liquidity Facility") from the Ad Hoc Committee, which

 was intended to ensure the Company's financial, and thereby operational, stability in the event of certain impacts to the Company's cash flow during the period of the Cash Flow Forecasts.
Management has continued to develop Cash Flow Forecasts

 since 25 May 2017. Based on the assumptions explained below and Management's view of the Company's likely cash flow, which includes updated assumptions around existing contracts and success in a number of tenders currently under way, the Company

 is expected to retain a free cash balance of between US$ 7.0m and US$ 41.7m during the period from 23 June 2017 to 31 December 2017 inclusive. The assumptions on which this is based include:
