 assigned to them in the terms and conditions for the Bonds (the "Terms and Conditions").
·k it it
1. Background
As communicated by the Issuer in the interim report of the second quarter 2017, FastPartner is reviewing its portfolio of loans

<<<

 issued by credit institutions classified as current liabilities due to amortisation or maturity within 12 months. FastPartner has an ongoing discussion with its main banks regarding margins and maturities for the part of the loan portfolio

<<<

 with short maturities, and FastPartner believes that the prospects to refinance these loans on existing market conditions through market loans are beneficial for the Issuer.
Due to the beneficial market conditions, the Issuer intends to, in

<<<

 near-time, repay SEK two (2) billion of its loan portfolio to credit institutions and intends to refinance this part of the loan portfolio with an unsecured commercial paper programme of the same amount. As the Issuer's contemplated repayment

<<<

 of the credit institution loans are to be made shortly, FastPartner will use a revolving credit amounting to SEK two (2) billion for the refinancing. Furthermore, in connection with the repayment of the loans from the credit institutions, the

<<<

 Issuer will issue the unsecured commercial paper programme, from which the net proceeds received successively will be used to repay the revolving credit. When commercial papers have been issued to the maximum amount of SEK two (2) billion,

<<<

 the Issuer will thus have an unutilized revolving credit which can be used as a back-up for the commercial paper program, if needed in future.
The Issuer has, as part of its financing, four outstanding bond loans; ISIN SE0005798725, SE0006

<<<

510210, SE0007576947 and SE0008434880 (the "Bond Loans"). According to the terms and conditions of the Bond Loans, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries are prohibited to incur any new, or prolong any existing, Financial Indebtedness unless it constitutes

<<<

 Permitted Debt.
The definition of Financial Indebtedness includes inter alia monies borrowed or raised, i.e. for example loans from credit institutions, and also includes Market Loans. A Market Loan is defined as any loan or other indebtedness

<<<

 where an entity issues commercial papers, certificates etcetera, if such instruments and securities are, or can be, subject to trade on Nasdaq Stockholm or any Regulated or unregulated market place.
Incurrence of loans from credit institutions

<<<

 (including revolving credits) and commercial papers are permitted according to the Terms and Conditions of the Bond Loans if the applicable prerequisites o f the definition "Permitted Debt" are met. Financial Indebtedness not being a Market

<<<

 Loan, i.e. loans from credit institutions (including revolving credits), are thus permitted, provided that the applicable Incurrence Test (pro forma including such
2 (11)

incurrence) is met. Hence, in such case, there are no restrictions

<<<

 on incurring bank debt or revolving credits. The contemplated commercial papers constitute Market Loans according to the Terms and Conditions of the Bond Loans, and such issuance is only permitted provided that (i) the Incurrence Test is met

<<<

, (ii) the commercial papers rank pari passu or are subordinated to the obligations o f the Issuer under the Bonds, and provided that the commercial papers (iii) have a final redemption date or, when applicable, early redemption dates or instalment

<<<

 dates which occur after the Bonds have been redeemed. Except for condition (iii), all other abovementioned criteria will be satisfied before issuing the contemplated commercial papers under the SEK two (2) billion commercial paper programme

<<<

. The commercial papers to be issued under the programme will have maturity periods in a range of one day up to one year from the day the commercial papers are issued, hence shorter terms to maturity than the bonds under the Bond Loans. In order

<<<

 for the Issuer to be able to issue commercial papers whose maturity dates and repayment dates occur before the bonds under the Bond Loans have been redeemed in full, the Issuer proposes to amend the Terms and Conditions o f the Bond Loans.

<<<

 The Issuer proposes that an amendment is made in accordance with the proposal as further described in Section 2 below, provided that the Incurrence Test (pro forma) is met and the commercial papers rank pari passu or are subordinated the obligations

<<<

 under the Bonds, the Issuer may from time to time incur commercial papers (including but not limited to the contemplated SEK two (2) billion commercial paper programme in question). The Issuer is of the opinion that the Holders would not be

<<<

 adversely affected considering that the contemplated refinancing of the loans from credit institutions would benefit the Group and indirectly the Holders since the terms of the commercial papers will be more advantageous to the Issuer compared

<<<

 to terms of for example a new bank loan and that the issuance of the contemplated commercial papers under the SEK two (2) billion commercial paper programme and the repayment of the bank loans will not incur any additional debt and furthermore

<<<

, that if the Issuer in the future would issue additional commercial papers under any new commercial paper programme such issuance would, similar to the contemplated SEK two (2) billion commercial paper programme, be subject to the Incurrence

<<<

 Test and the commercial papers would rank pari passu or be subordinated the obligations of the Issuer under the Bonds.
