 Agreem ent").
1. PROPOSED EARLY REDEMPTION The outstanding amount under the Bond Loan is currently approx. NOK 21 million w ith only a few individual Bondholders, and the Issuer therefore, in light also of other financing arrangements in place

, finds it less purposeful to continue to maintain the loan and associated costs. On this basis, the Company therefore proposes an early redemption o f all Outstanding Bonds, at a price o f 100.00% of par value plus accrued unpaid interest.

The proposed early redemption will apply to all Outstanding Bonds. Settlement o f redeemed Bonds, subject to approval at the Bondholders' meeting, is expected to take place on or about 12 March 2012.
The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee

<<<

 that Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Bond Loan have granted their pre-approval to the proposed early redemption and have irrevocably undertaken to vote in favor of the proposed resolution in the Bondholders' meeting.
The request

<<<

 and repayment proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable. For further information on

<<<

 the Issuer, see www.noccasa.no and www.newsweb.no for stock exchange announcements.
