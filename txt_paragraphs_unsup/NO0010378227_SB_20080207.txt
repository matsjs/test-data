Goldbelt owns 100 % of the shares of Resolute Ltd

<<<

 (West Africa) ("Resolute").

Resolute owns 90% of the shares in the project company Société de Mines Belehouro SA ("Société"). The remaining 10 % of the shares in Société are owned by the Republic of Burkina Faso.

planned serviced through the cash flow

 generated by the Project. Therefore, the Borrower emphasize that it will be in the Bondholders interest to give the necessary waivers in order to secure the financing of the Project as described below.
Project completion is estimated to be

<<<

 12 months after the completion of the Restructuring outlined above, which means Project completion is expected to be end of May 2009 if the Restructuring is completed on schedule. So far the Project is on schedule.
The financing To partially

<<<

 finance the cost of construction and development of the Project, Macquarie Bank Limited (the "Bank") has offered Societe a loan facility of USD 65 million (the "Offer") with final maturity 30 June 2012, together with swaps, hedging, foreign

<<<

 exchange etc. hereinafter referred to as (the "Bank Facility"). In addition to the Bank Facility the Borrower has invested USD 20 million in equity in the Project. The term sheet for the Bank Facility was negotiated prior to the acquisition

<<<

 of Goldbelt by WM Inc. Societe is planning to make the first draw-down on the Bank Facility by the end of February 2008. According to the Offer it will be a condition precedent for the first draw-down that all securities pursuant to the Offer

<<<

 (as described below) have been established.
The security of the Bank Facility
Societe asset pledge A perfected first ranking priority security interest in all of Society's tangible and intangible assets in favor of the Bank. According to the

<<<

 Loan Agreement clause 13.2.d) iv) this security will not require any approval from the Bondholders.
Share pledge Prior to the Restructuring, a pledge over all shares Goldbelt holds in Societe. After the Restructuring, a pledge over all shares

<<<

 Newco holds in Societe (the "Societe Share Pledge"). The pledge will be in favor of the Bank. According to The Borrower, local legislation necessitates the shares being pledged in order to make the asset pledge effective. The Borrower points

<<<

 out that as a consequence of all the assets of Societe being pledged to the Bank, a pledge over the shares in Societe will not constitute a significant effect on the rights of the Bondholders. The pledge will be in effect until all the obligations

<<<

 of Societe and the Guarantors (as described below) under the Bank Facility are satisfied. This Societe Share Pledge requires the approval form the Bondholders' meeting.
Parent company guarantee A guarantee (the "Guarantee") in favor of the

<<<

 Bank is to be given by Goldbelt and Resolute prior to the Restructuring, and by the Borrower post Restructuring (together the "Guarantors") to cover cost overruns of the Project as well as the fulfillment of obligations under the Bank Facility

<<<

. The Guarantee will fall away upon time of completion of the Project. The Borrowers obligations under the Guarantee shall rank pari-passu or better than the Borrowers obligations under the Loan Agreement. This Guarantee requires the approval

<<<

 from the Bondholders' meeting.
Parent company asset pledge A perfected first ranking priority security interest in all of the Borrowers tangible and intangible assets, except for non-Project related assets (the "Parent Company Asset Pledge

<<<

")

in favor of the Bank. According to the Borrower, all of the assets related to the Project are owned by Societe and not by the Borrower or NewCo AS, and as a consequence the carve-out for non-Project

<<<

 asset will imply that this security will not constitute any real obligation for the Borrower. The security interest will be in force from the first draw-down on the Bank Facility and until all obligations of Societe and the Guarantors under

<<<

 the Bank Facility are fulfilled. This Parent Company Asset Pledge requires the approval from the Bondholders' meeting.
Debt Service Reserve Account Resolute (prior to the Restructuring) and NewCo (post Restructuring) shall maintain a Debt Service

<<<

 Account ("DSRA") The balance of the DSRA may be funded from excess Project cashflow prior first principal repayment and the account is to be maintained in USD to a minimum cash balance representing Societe's debt service obligations estimated

<<<

 for the following six-month period. The DSRA shall be pledged to the Bank. The pledge of the DSRA account requires the approval from the Bondholders' meeting.
The proposal The Loan Agreement places certain covenants on the Borrower and it's

<<<

 subsidiaries with regards to permitting encumbrances upon assets and shares, as well as granting guarantees.
The proposed pledge over the assets of Societe, the project company, is permitted under the Loan Agreement as part of project financing

<<<

 under clause 13.2.d) iv).
The proposed pledge over the shares Goldbelt holds in Societe, to be replaced by a pledge over the shares Newco holds in Societe after the planned Restructuring, requires a waiver of the Loan Agreement clause 13.2

<<<

.d) to be granted by a Bondholders meeting according to the Loan Agreement, although the practical implications of such a pledge is of minor importance due to the assets of Societe being pledged.
The proposed parent company Guarantee by Goldbelt

<<<

 and Resolute prior to the Restructuring and the Borrower after the Restructuring, requires a waiver of the covenant in clause 13.2. g in the Loan Agreement to be granted by the Bondholder's meeting. The Guarantee will fall away at the time

<<<

 of completion of the Project. The Guarantee period is estimated to be approximately 15 months after the first draw-down of the Bank Facility. The Borrower proposes that the Bondholders meeting grant a temporary waiver for this specific Guarantee

<<<

.
The proposed security interest in the Project related assets of the Borrower requires a waiver of the Loan Agreement clause 13.2. d) granted by a Bondholders meeting.
Provided that the summoned Bondholders' meeting approves the requested waivers

<<<

, the Borrower will compensate the Bondholders with a finite waiver fee of 0.25 % (flat). The record date of the waiver fee will be by the end of the business day after the date of the Bondholders' meeting, and will be due 22 February 2008.

<<<

 (which is six banking days after the day of the bondholders meeting)
For more detailed information , please contact CFO Sverre Slattsveen, Wega Mining ASA, phone: +47 23 16 01 03.
To enable the Borrower to conduct the proposed waivers of the

<<<

 relevant covenants in the Loan Agreement, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed waivers.

N O RSK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, any risk

<<<

 in connection with development of mining licenses should be ring fenced and financed on a limited recourse basis. The Guarantee and the security of the Bank Facility are destructive to this principal rule. Based on the aforesaid, the proposed

<<<

 waiver, in the opinion of the Loan Trustee, will significantly weaken the creditor's position of the Bondholders. Therefore, the Loan Trustee requests the Bondholders themselves to evaluate this carefully before any vote are casted. The Bondholders

<<<

 must themselves evaluate whether the proposed waiver is acceptable to them given the offered compensation.

However, in the opinion of the Borrower it is important to have in mind that the Loan is planned serviced through the cash flow generated

<<<

 by the Project, and therefore it will be in the interest of the Bondholders to give the necessary waivers in order to secure the financing of the Project.
