 dialogue with the Issuer with regards to the proposal for the meeting.
In view of the Requesting Bondholders, the proposal (i) does not provide any information for the Bondholders to make an assessment to accept the proposal, (ii) does not

<<<

 provide any liquidity or solve any financial solution for the Issuer, and (iii) does not take into account that the Bonds are independent securities with a capital class prior of the Warrants, and such that the Bonds should have been compensated

 for the proposed extention. The Requesting Bondholders do note that the bondholder meeting scheduled on 20 December have pre acceptance from >2/3 of the Bondholders (the "Accepting Bondholders"), meanwhile question the abovementioned information

o Extending the Bond as proposed in the summons to the Bondholders meeting of 20 December 2013, does not provide the announced need for funds supporting ordinary course of business into 2014.
· Material Adverse Effect: o Project companies

<<<

 have defaulted on it's debt and/or require further capital to obtain the Issuers ownership. These processes have have continiously been extended with highly uncertain outcomes, with a high probability to have a Material Adverse Effect on the

<<<

 Group as a whole if not remedied.
· Subordinated debts: o The Issuer has, in breach of the Bond Agreement, repaid several subordinated loans to the Issuer's CEO Joar Viken, and it is reason to belive that more similar loans will be paid o Past

<<<

 disposals made by the Issuer to its suppliers and partners are still being evaluated, that later may be declared in breach with the Bond Agreement or made invalid, and thereby claimed to be repaid.
On this background, the Requesting Bondholders

<<<

 are of the opinion that the Issuer is in breach of the Bond Agreement regarding the conditions mentioned above.
The Requesting Bondholders want to comment to the attached statement from the Issuer that the Issuer was presented with this information

<<<

 on 13 December, but with a deadline to account for the relevant issues within 16 December by way of a meeting. The Bond Trustee was further instructed by the Requesting Bondholders to summon for this Bondholders Meeting if the Issuer did not

<<<

 meet this request.
2. Proposal The Bondholders' Meeting is summoned to approve that the Bond Trustee, based on the Default Events, declares the entire Bond Issue in default and due for immediate payment. The Bond Trustee reserves the right

<<<

 to enforce such action regardless of Bondholders' Meeting if not remedied, or breach is perceived evident. 3. Non-reliance Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently
