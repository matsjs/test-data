<<<

 2014/2019 with ISIN NO 001 070820.9 (the "Bond Issue") issued by Harkand Finance Inc. (the "Issuer") pursuant to the bond agreement dated 27 March 2014 (the "Bond Agreement"), and amended and restated on 7 July 2015, between, amongst others

All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement unless otherwise stated.

Background

The Issuer is part of the Harkand group (the "G roup"), which is in the business of owning and chartering

 vessels. The Issuer issued the Bonds to the Bondholder on 28 March 2014 and used the proceeds of the Bonds to finance (in part) the purchase price of the Vessels. The Vessels were acquired by Subsidiaries of the Issuer and are currently on

<<<

 charter to other members o f the Group.

On 16 March 2016, the Bond Trustee published a notice announcing that the Bond Trustee had notified the company that the Bonds had been declared to be in default (the "Default Notice"), and that the

<<<

 bond trustee had exercised its rights to replace the board of directors of the Issuer and its two subsidiaries Harkand Atlantis Inc. and Harkand Da Vinci Inc.

In the Default Notice the Bond Trustee informed the Issuer that it would continue

<<<

 to discuss with the Issuer a consensual solution that would render the company and its subsidiaries solvent, and that the Bond Trustee at the time of the Default Notice would not declare the bonds to be due for immediate payment but the reserved

 all rights and remedies.
