All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this notice (the "Notice") shall have the meanings assigned

1. Background
The Issuer completed a SEK 30,000,000 Subsequent Bond Issue on 15 June 2017. One of the purposes of the Subsequent Bond Issue were to repay an Existing Debt Facility in the Issuer's South Korean subsidiary. The Issuer has encountered

<<<

 difficulties with facilitating a commercially justifiable repayment of the aforementioned Existing Debt Facility and as a result, SEK 12,077,663 from the Subsequent Bond Issue has not been disbursed from the Escrow Account. The SEK 12,077,

<<<

663 standing on the Escrow Account are hereafter referred to as the "Proceeds". The Issuer is now contemplating using the Proceeds towards (i) financing Newbuild Capex, (ii) payment of Transaction Costs in connection with the Subsequent Bond

<<<

 Issue and this Notice and (iii) general corporate purposes of the Group.
The Issuer has, under Clause 4.3 (Conditions Precedentfor disbursement in connection with a Subsequent Bond Issue) of the Terms and Conditions, undertaken to, in the event

<<<

 that the conditions precedent set out therein are not fulfilled within thirty (30) Business Days from the Issue Date of such Subsequent Bond Issue, redeem all Bonds pursuant to the provisions set out in Clause 4.2 (c). The undertaking is primarily

<<<

 aimed to cover the proceeds stemming from the Initial Bond Issue but is applied mutatis mutandis for any Subsequent Bond Issue.
It is in the interest of the Issuer to utilise all of the proceeds from the Subsequent Bond Issue as soon as possible

<<<

 but in order to do this, the Bondholders have to waive certain provisions of Terms and Conditions in order for the proceeds to be disbursed from the Escrow Account as contemplated above.
2. Waivers of the Terms and Conditions and Release Request

<<<


In view of the above and for the purpose of enabling the Issuer to utilise all of the proceeds, the Issuer hereby kindly requests the Bondholders to consent to waive clauses 4.2(c), 4.3 (b) and 3(b) (i) and (ii) of the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 and that the Bondholders waive any covenants or undertakings in the proceeds account pledge agreement dated 20 June 2017 in order to allow the Proceeds to be disbursed in accordance with Clause 3 below.
2 (7)

Furthermore, the Issuer kindly

<<<

 requests that the Agent shall have the right to release part or all of the Transaction Security over the Escrow Account upon a request and payment instruction from the Issuer, provided that the Agent (acting reasonably) deem such request and

<<<

 payment instruction to be in accordance with Clause 3 below.
3 . Conditions
The Issuer acknowledges that the agreement by the Bondholders to the waivers in Clause 2 is subject to the conditions that the Proceeds are applied towards the following

<<<

:
(i) financing Newbuild Capex in a total amount of up to SEK 8,400,000;
(ii) payment of Transaction Costs in connection with the Subsequent Bond Issue and this Notice; and
(iii) financing general corporate purposes of the Group.
For the avoidance

<<<

 of doubt, when presenting the Agent with evidence of an Equity Capital Raising, the Issuer shall be permitted to include Equity from the Equity Capital Raising's that took place in April and May 2017.
Further for the avoidance o f doubt, the

<<<

 waiver in Clause 2 will only apply to the Proceeds and does not affect any other current or future security provided by the Issuer.
4. Consent
We kindly ask the Bondholders to confirm that the Bondholders, subject to Clause 3 agree to the waivers

<<<

 and release request set out in Clause 2.
The waivers and release requests referred to above are hereafter referred to as the "Requests".
5. Written Procedure
The following instructions need to be adhered to under the second Written Procedure

<<<

.
5.1 Final date to participate in the Written Procedure
The Agent must have received the votes by mail, courier or email to the address indicated below no later than 17:00 (CEST), 22 May 2018. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.


<<<

5.2 Decision procedure
The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate under the Written Procedure as valid votes.
When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the

<<<

 Agent, the Requests shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure will: i) be sent by notice to the Bondholders

<<<

 and ii) be published on the websites o f a) the Issuer and b) the Agent.
3 (7)

A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Bondholders, irrespective of them responding in the Written Procedure.
5.3 Voting rights and

<<<

 authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (9 May 2018) in the debt register:
(a) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities Account; or
(b) be registered as authorised nominee

<<<

 in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.
5.4 Bonds registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary

<<<

, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power

<<<

 of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the

<<<

 intermediary that is registered in the debt register as bondholder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a Bondholder of the

<<<

 Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your

<<<

 behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure

<<<

 and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights.
5.5 Quorum
No quorum requirement will

<<<

 apply to this second Written Procedure.
