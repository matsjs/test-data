Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Trustee") for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue ISIN NO 001 068372.5 (with total outstanding

<<<

 amount of NOK 500 million) (the "Bond Issue" or "SBO01") issued by Selvaag Bolig ASA (the "Issuer" or the "Company").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 24 June 2013 and made

<<<

 between the Trustee and the Issuer (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. References to Clauses and paragraphs are references to Clauses and paragraphs in the Bond Agreement.
The information in this summons regarding the legal

<<<

, operational and financial status o f the Issuer is provided by the Issuer. The Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information givenfrom the Issuer.
1. BACKGROUND
The Issuer issued SBO01 in June 20

<<<

13 with the purpose of refinancing existing debt and for general corporate purpose. The Issuer is one of Norway's largest residential real estate developers with prime focus on areas in Norway with solid economic growth, such as the Greater

<<<

-Oslo area and Stavanger. The Issuer is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange with a market cap of approximately NOK 1.85 billion as of [()] 2014 and is majority owned by Selvaag Gruppen AS (53.5%).
The Issuer has over the last 18 months delivered

<<<

 solid financial performance. Pareto Securities Credit Research maintains a BB rating on the Issuer, reflecting the Issuer's robust business model combined with the solid project pipeline and its sizable land bank.
According to clause 13.5 of

<<<

 the Bond Agreement the Issuer is required to comply with the following Financial Covenants during the term of the Bond Issue:
a) Equity Ratio of minimum 22.5%; and b) Sales Ratio of minimum 70%.
Sales Ratio is defined as the percentage sold

<<<

 of residential units under construction as reported by the Group.
As of 30 June 2014, the Issuer's Equity Ratio and Sales Ratio were approximately 36% and 76% respectively. The development of the Financial Covenants since the Settlement Date

<<<

 in the second quarter 2013, have been as follows:

Sales ratio covenant (minimum 70%)

Source: Selvaag Bolig ASA

The Issuer is of the opinion that the current level of the Sales Ratio limits the Group's operational flexibility and may prohibit the Group from engaging

<<<

 in attractive projects. Additionally, the current level of the Sales Ratio covenant limits the Group's ability to achieve optimal pricing for its projects as the best prices are usually achieved in the period after project start-up and up to

<<<

 delivery.

This means that as soon as the Issuer for a specific project is in compliance with the Sales Ratio required by the bank(s) providing the construction loan for the relevant project (normally equal to a Sales Ratio of 60%), the Issuer

<<<

 is in a position to increase pricing for the residual portion of unsold residential units resulting in overall increased earnings for the Group.

However, with the current Sales Ratio requirement of 70% in the Bond Agreement, the Issuer is

<<<

 prohibited to increase prices on unsold residential units sold until the 70% threshold is reached. Consequently, and in order to align the Sales Ratio requirement with the Group's lending banks, the Issuer would ask the Bondholders to amend

<<<

 the required Sales Ratio from 70% to 60%, such that the Issuer can benefit from increased pricing on a larger portion of unsold residential units.

The Issuer has also experienced that the current definition of Permitted Financial Indebtedness

<<<

 does not allow the Issuer to provide certain guarantees which are beneficial for the Issuer's business. Such guarantees are deemed to be in the ordinary course of the Issuer's business and necessary to maximize the operations of the Group.

<<<

 For instance, in connection with the realization of certain building projects, the Norwegian tax authority requires the Issuer to provide guarantees to secure possible future payment obligations due to taxation of profit. The existing Bond

<<<

 Agreement does not allow for such guarantees and consequently, and in order to comply with the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has provided the Norwegian tax authorities with a cash collateral for the issuance of these types of guarantees. By pledging

<<<

 cash for such a guarantee, the Issuer's free available cash position is severely impacted and prevents the Issuer from further growth. The Issuer would like to include such guarantee and other guarantees which are issued in the ordinaiy course

<<<

 of business in the definition of Permitted Financial Indebtedness which will give the Issuer an improved operational flexibility and the ability to grow its business further.

As compensation to the suggested amendments of the Sales Ratio and

<<<

 the Permitted Financial Indebtedness, and in order for the Bondholders to maintain a good creditor position, the Issuer proposes to increase the Equity Ratio covenant from the current level of 22.5% up to 25.0% to and including 30 June 201

<<<

7, and to 27.5% anytime thereafter.

Furthermore, the Issuer proposes to remove the Call Option (@ 103%) for the period from and including the Interest Payment Date in June 2016 to, but not including the Interest Payment Date in June 2017.


<<<


In summary the proposed amendments will:

· increase earnings potential of the Group as the Issuer will be able to increase pricing for a larger portion of its unsold residential units; and
· release trapped cash and enhance the Groups' operational

<<<

 flexibility.
The Issuer is of the opinion that the proposed amendments will provide the Bondholders with additional comfort regarding the Issuer's financial position and the increased Equity Ratio requirement together with the removal of the

<<<

 first Call Option period will further enhance the Bondholders' creditor position.
