The Issuer has tried to sell its vessel MV

<<<

 "Thorshovdi" (the "Vessel") to several interested parties. The only offer that has materialized would as it currently stands result in an amount of NOK 130 million (before costs and expenses) being made available to secured creditors with a

<<<

 security interest in the Vessel (the "Offer"). The Offer is understood to be for the Vessel free of encumbrances. However, the Bondholders are also requested to approve a sale of the shares in the Issuer on substantially similar terms. .
If

<<<

 the Offer is to be accepted by IN and the Bondholders, IN and the Bondholders need to consent to discharge their mortgages over the Vessel. If the shares in the Issuer are sold, Bondholders will also need to discharge then- outstanding loans

<<<

/bonds.
The first priority loan owed to IN, including the Additional Loan, is in the nominal amount of NOK 105 million plus interest and expenses amounting to additional approximately NOK 3.5 mill.
There may be maritime liens connected to the

<<<

 Vessel. According to the company there are no known maritime liens except possibly for a bunker claim (described below). There may however be maritime liens presented in connection with the sale, and such maritime liens will have priority before

<<<

 the mortgagees. There may also be some cost involved in connection with the sale, release of loans and mortgages etc.
An unpaid claim for bunkers delivered to the Vessel (the "Bunker Claim") in the amount of approximately NOK 7 mill has been

<<<

 presented by the claimant as a maritime lien. The status of this claim as a maritime lien may be disputed. It is anticipated that an amount equal of the Bunker Claim may need to be placed on an escrow account awaiting a result of a dispute

<<<

 regarding the status of the Bunkers Claim,
The proposal assumes that the IN loan will be fully paid upon acceptance of the Offer, irrespective of the status of the Bunker Claim.
The proceeds to the Bondholders will depend on the final offer

<<<

 for the Vessel, or alternatively the Issuer, the costs involved with the repayment of secured claims and the status of the Bunker Claim as a maritime lien. IN has agreed that, if the Bunker Claim is a maritime lien, IN will accept to cover

<<<

 up to NOK 2 mill of the Bunker Claim.
The amount available for distribution to Bondholders is expected to be between NOK 10 mill and NOK 20 mill, but Bondholders should be prepared that the proceeds may be less than this.
It is proposed a pro

<<<

 rata distribution with 85 % of the net proceeds of the Offer (after deduction of the IN loan, maritime liens and cost) to the Second Priority Bond Issues, and 15 % of the proceeds to the Third Priority Bond Issue.
The Bondholders in the Second

<<<

 Priority I Bond may in addition receive proceeds from sale of inventory included in the existing Loan Security for this Bond.
All Bond Issues must consent to the Offer.
In case the Offer fails and other Offers materialize or acceptance or completion

<<<

 o f the Offer is delayed, Bondholders are requested to approve an offer on substantially the same terms as described above, regardless of who the offeror is or whether the offer is made and/or accepted before or after a bankruptcy of the Issuer

<<<

, such offer in such case to be deemed approved on the same terms and conditions as if it were the Offer.
