Real Estate funds managed

 by Blackstone has through Vega Holdco S. a r.l. ("Vega") entered into a share and purchase agreement with the Issuer for the sale by the Issuer and the purchase by Vega of 75% of the Issuer's shareholding in D. Carnegie for SEK 1.18 billion

<<<

 in cash. Vega will also receive a power of attorney to vote on behalf of the Issuer at shareholders' meetings in D. Carnegie, and a right of first offer for the remaining shares in D. Carnegie owned by the Issuer.
Vega has also entered into

<<<

 two additional share purchase agreements for the acquisition of (i) 45% of Frasdale Int. B.V's shareholding in D. Carnegie f (representing approx. 5% of the voting rights and 4% of the share capital in D. Carnegie) and receive a power of attorney

<<<

 to vote on behalf of, and a right of first offer for remaining 25% of Frasdale's shareholding and (ii) 100% of Svensk Bolig Holding AB's shareholding in D. Carnegie (representing approx. 10% of the voting rights and 13% of the share capital

<<<

 in the D. Carnegie).
All of these acquisitions and contributions are made at the same price, and are conditional on, among other things, regulatory approval being granted and the Issuer obtaining the consent of its Noteholders to dispose of

<<<

 its shares in D. Carnegie. If the conditions are satisfied (or, in certain circumstances, waived) Vega will be controlling a total of 53% of the voting rights in D. Carnegie. The transactions will, if completed, eventually result in Vega passing

<<<

 the threshold for a mandatory offer obligation.
Use of proceeds
Subject to the successful completion of the above mentioned transactions, the Issuer will have approx. SEK 1.18 billion in cash on its balance sheet, as compared with SEK 50.5

<<<

 million as per 31 March 2016. The Issuer intends to use approx. SEK 370 million to amortise part of its existing secured and unsecured debt. In addition, the Issuer proposes subject to the successful completion of the transaction to carry out

<<<

 a partial redemption of its Notes of approx. SEK 100 million (see details below). These measures would lower the Issuer's interest-bearing debt to approx. SEK 1.5 billion, compared with approx. SEK 1.97 billion as per 31 March 2016, which including

<<<

 cash amounts to a net interest-bearing debt of approx. SEK 790 million. The Issuer believes that this will significantly strengthen its financial position and empower the Issuer with financial flexibility going forward. As the Issuer remains

<<<

 an active participant and consolidator in

4126-5664-3077, v. 2

3 ( 10)

the Swedish real estate market, the Issuer sees ample investment opportunities going forward and is currently involved in negotiations for additional property acquisitions

<<<

 in the Stockholm Region with an aggregate value of approx. SEK 1 billion. Apart from its real estate portfolio, the Issuer is looking to further develop its profitable investments within Kvalitena Industries to provide diversification in its

<<<

 portfolio.
The Notes
Although the shares in D. Carnegie are not pledged as security for the Notes, the Terms and Conditions limit the possibility for the Issuer to decrease its consolidated holdings in Stendörren and D. Carnegie AB below 7

<<<

5% of the initial holdings (29,244,151 shares), corresponding to 21,933,113 shares.
The Issuer is therefore proposing amendments of the Terms and Conditions, enabling the Issuer to divest its D Carnegie shares to Vega.
As the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 include a dividend cap of the lower of 50% of previous fiscal year's net profit and SEK 30 million, the Issuer will retain a significant cash amount of approx. SEK 1.18 billion on its balance sheet after the divestment of 75 % of the D. Carnegie

<<<

 shares. Therefore, the Issuer proposes to amend the Terms and Conditions to allow for a one-time amortization of the Notes of SEK 100 million at a premium in line with the first call premium of the Terms and Conditions, i.e. 103% of the nominal

<<<

 amount. The Issuer also proposes to extend the time when at the latest its audited consolidated financial statements for each year shall be made available to the Noteholders from four months to five months. The background for this request is

<<<

 to allow the Issuer sufficient time to finalize the statements.
2. Amendments to the Terms and Conditions
2.1 Proposal for amendment

<<<
