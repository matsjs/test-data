LISTING PROSPECTUS
Listing of EUR 130,000,000 Capital Securities
On 27 June 2008, Sponda Plc ("Sponda", the "Issuer" or the "Company") issued unsecured and subordinated capital securities with an aggregate nominal amount of EUR 130,000,000 

<<<

(the "Capital Securities") to certain institutional investors. The nominal value of each Capital Security is EUR 50,000. This document (this document and the documents incorporated hereto by reference jointly referred to as the "Listing Prospectus

<<<

") is drawn up solely for the purpose of admission of the Capital Securities to public trading on OMX Nordic Exchange Helsinki Oy (the "Helsinki Stock Exchange") and does not constitute any offering of the Capital Securities.
This Listing Prospectus

<<<

 has been drawn up in accordance with the requirements of Finnish legislation, i.e. in compliance with the content requirements provided in the Finnish Securities Markets Act (26.5.1989/495, as amended) (the "Finnish Securities Markets Act"

RISK FACTORS
Investors considering investment in the Capital o fthe Company should carefully review the information contained in this Listing Prospectus andparticularly the riskfactors provided

<<<

 below in the Listing Prospectus and the stock exchange releasespublished by the Company. Factors possibly affecting the investment decision are also discussed elsewhere in the Listing Prospectus. Should one or more o f the riskfactors described

<<<

 herein materialize, it could have an adverse effect on the operations, financial condition and results o f operations o f the Company and its group or on the price o f the Company's securities. The following description is a summary o f certain

<<<

 riskfactors that may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfill its obligations under the Capital Securities or that are material in order to assess the market risk associated with the Capital Securities. This description is based on information

<<<

 known and assessed at the time o fpreparing this Listing Prospectus, and therefore the description o f the risk factors is not necessarily exhaustive. The risks involved in an investment in the Capital Securities are not limited to thefactors

<<<

 identified below and the sequence in which thefollowing riskfactors are listed is not an indication o ftheir likelihood to occur or o f the extent o f their commercial consequences. All investors should make their own evaluations o f the risks

<<<

 associated with an investment in the Capital Securities and consult with their own professional advisers i f they consider it necessary. The market price o f the securities could decline due to the realization o f these risks, and investors

<<<

 could lose part or all o ftheir investments.
Risks relating to Sponda
In Sponda, risks are taken to mean the uncertainty involved in implementing the Group's approved targets. Identified risks have been classified as strategic risks, operational

<<<

 risks, casualty risks and financial risks. Strategic risks in Sponda include the risks associated with the property market and the risks related to property investments and purchases.
Variations in macroeconomicfactors and property marketfluctuations

<<<

 may affect the Company
The property market is sensitive to fluctuations in supply and demand. Property values typically follow business cycles. Property values are affected by a number of factors including interest rates, inflation, economic

<<<

 growth, business conditions, credit availability, property tax, demographical factors, the level of construction activity, and the availability of leasable space. Changes in supply and demand in local markets, resulting from new construction

<<<

 or other factors, may also materially affect property values regardless of the overall development of fundamental factors in the regional real estate market. Without corresponding change in rental income, lower yield requirements lead to higher

<<<

 property values, and vice versa. For this reason the value of Sponda's property portfolio and the company's financial performance can vary and can be significantly affected by both general economic factors and local market conditions. Furthermore

<<<

, increases in property values without corresponding increases in rental amounts may affect Sponda's ability to continue to develop its property portfolio through the acquisition of high-quality properties located in Sponda's areas of geographical

<<<

 concentration.
For example, the supply of rental space can be increased considerably by the completion of new construction projects resulting in an excessive supply of rental space or marketable property. In the past, excessive availability

<<<

 of commercial properties has lead to a decrease in rental income and in property valuation and prices, whereas a reduction of available rental space has resulted in higher valuations of properties. Demand, in particular for commercial rental

<<<

 space, has primarily been dependent on general macroeconomic developments. Slow economic development, for instance, can lead to higher vacancy rates for office properties. These factors, either alone or in combination, might have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on the business operations, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the value of the Company's securities.
Rental levels and occupancy rates are affected by general economic factors as well as levels

<<<

 of construction of new premises. There can be no assurance that expiring leases can be renewed on their existing terms and conditions or that any property will be fully leased and, thus, vacancies may occur. In the case of vacancies, Sponda

<<<

 bears costs that, if the property was rented, it would normally charge to the tenant in the form of ancillary costs, as well as the loss of rent from that property. There can be no assurance that Sponda will be able to increase its occupancy

<<<

 rates from current levels or to maintain them on their current level.
Risks related to development operations have an effect on Sponda
Sponda's property development operations focus on undeveloped sites, buildings with modernization needs as

<<<

 well as on greenfield development projects. Development projects typically require a considerable amount of planning before the commencement of the project is secured, and Sponda incurs costs in relation to the planning phase. Development projects

<<<

 are subject to regulation by governmental entities and agencies in connection with obtaining and renewing licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations and this may cause delays as well as hinder the commencement of the project. Development

<<<

 projects and related investments may take several years to complete, but Sponda does not typically receive full rental income from the property until the project is completed. The commencement of a development project normally requires a certain

<<<

 pre-leasing rate, but there can be no assurance that Sponda will be able to achieve commercially viable occupancy rates after the completion of the projects.
1

Sponda relies on subcontractors for its design and construction work. If Sponda

<<<

 cannot enter into subcontracting arrangements on acceptable terms (or at all) it will incur additional costs which may have an adverse effect on its business. The competition for the services of quality contractors and subcontractors may cause

<<<

 delays in construction, exposing Sponda to a loss of competitive advantage. Subcontracting arrangements may have to be carried out on less favourable terms than would otherwise be available, which may result in increased development and construction

<<<

 costs. By relying on subcontractors, Sponda becomes subject to a number of risks relating to these entities, such as quality of performance, delays in timing, construction defects and the financial stability of the subcontractors. A labour

<<<

 shortage of subcontractors may also have a detrimental effect on Sponda and its subcontractors and, as a result, on Sponda's ability to conclude the construction phase on time and within budget.
Deviation from the agreed timetable, quality

<<<

 requirements or construction costs can cause increased costs and termination of investment agreements and further result in claims by third parties for damages and termination of respective lease agreements.
Competition in the Finnish real

<<<

 estate market has increased
During the past few years, property investment has become an increasingly international business and the Finnish real estate market has also stabilized its position as a target for international property investors

<<<

. New investors are mostly large international property investors that have sufficient resources to enter the market with major acquisitions, and these foreign investors have accounted for a significant part of the property transactions in Finland

<<<

 in 2006 and 2007. During the second quarter of 2008 the property market has slowed down in Finland, and only a few transactions took place. So far property prices in Helsinki's central business district have not shown a decline, even though

<<<

 the market has been expecting this. Sponda is geared up for a fall in the value of properties in the future.
There can be no assurance that Sponda will be able to maintain its market share and to benefit from its current position. The increased

<<<

 competition in the Finnish real estate market could weaken Sponda's position, market share and growth possibilities, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of Sponda.
Differences

<<<

 in legal systems between Finland and Russia could present risksfo r Sponda's business
As a part of its strategy, Sponda is expanding into Russia, particularly into St Petersburg and Moscow. Russia has a different legal system than Finland and

<<<

 this may result in risks to Sponda's business. There are also risks in Russia relating to the procedures for obtaining permits, which may affect the timetable for the planned property development projects in progress. In addition, the political

<<<

 situation in Russia and, compared to Finland, the different administrative regime can expose Sponda to various risks.
The loss or insolvency o f significant tenants can lead to significant rent losses
At the end of 2007 Sponda had 1,519 customers

<<<

 and 2,901 separate lease agreements. A number of Sponda's properties are partly or wholly rented to large corporate tenants. The loss or the insolvency of one or more of Sponda's major tenants could lead to a significant loss of income. A large

<<<

 number of vacancies lasting over a longer period of time may have an adverse effect on the property valuation as well as on the financial position and results of operations of Sponda.
In general, the management of Sponda considers its relationship

<<<

 with its larger tenants to be good. However, no assurance can be given that in the future one or more of these tenants would not move to other premises or seek to obtain more favourable lease terms, either of which could result in a material

<<<

 adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of Sponda.
Indefinite leases carry risk o f having a significant number o f leases cancelled at the same time
Sponda has entered into indefinite leases (approximately 14% of

<<<

 all leases on the date of this Prospectus), which are relatively common in the Finnish commercial real estate market, in order to accommodate tenant requests or to allow itself the flexibility to replace tenants or, if possible, increase rents

<<<

 at a later time. However, leasing properties on an indefinite basis carries with it the risk that a significant number of leases will be terminated at the same time, as a result of general economic conditions, new construction or other factors

<<<

. However, there can be no assurance that Sponda will continue to be able to retain tenants at its properties that are leased on an indefinite basis.
Locations where Sponda's properties are situated may become unattractive
The real estate market

<<<

 is impacted by the location of the property. Locations where Sponda's properties are situated may become unattractive. The perceived quality of a location can change considerably over time and, thus, have an adverse effect on the performance

<<<

 of the property.
2

As the Company's current property portfolio is concentrated on properties in the Helsinki Central Business District, the Ruoholahti area in the City of Helsinki and in the major cities in Finland, its business is highly

<<<

 dependent on the development of these areas as well as the development of the Finnish economy. To facilitate new growth and to decrease its dependence on the development of the Finnish real estate market, Sponda has expanded its business into

<<<

 Russia and in the future it also intends to expand its operations into the Baltic countries. Although Sponda currently expects significant growth in these new geographic focus areas, the high level of concentration and dependency on the positive

<<<

 development of the Finnish economy and Finnish real estate markets, particularly in the City of Helsinki, constitute risks for Sponda's business and may have a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of Sponda

<<<

.
Operational disturbances and events may affect Sponda's business operations
Sponda's operational risks are risks resulting from inadequate or defective internal processes or systems. They also include risks associated with the legal operating

<<<

 environment. Operational risks relate, for example, to the functionality of the company's information systems and to the permanence of its skilled employees.
Operational risks and related losses may result from inadequate internal processes

<<<

, fraud, errors by employees, failure to comply with regulatory requirements and Sponda's internal guidelines, equipment failures or malfunctions of information systems or external systems as well as natural disasters. Although Sponda has implemented

<<<

 risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and strives for continuous development of procedures, it is not certain that such procedures will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by Sponda.
Fluctuations in interest

<<<

 rates may adversely affect Sponda's earnings and the value o f its property
Sponda is sensitive to the usual financial risks, i.e. interest rate, funding, liquidity and currency risks. The main financial risks are interest and exchange rate

<<<

 risks and risks relating to the availability of financing.
Changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on real estate businesses and their valuation. A substantial increase in interest rates may affect private consumption, the ability

<<<

 of tenants to pay rents and could potentially lead to increased vacancy rates and a decrease in the value of properties and valuation yields for the Company's properties. In addition, an increase in the interest rate level would have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on the cost of financing and the Company's current financing expenses. At the date o f this Listing Prospectus it is not completely clear how the recently emerged international financial market turbulence and tightening of global

<<<

 credit conditions will affect the markets in which Sponda operates. There can be no assurance that Sponda will not be adversely effected by these developments. The Company carefully monitors the development of interest rates and actively seeks

<<<

 to hedge its position against changes in the interest rates. Despite the Company's active measures to manage these potential developments, a failure to properly manage such risks could result in a material adverse effect on the business operations

<<<

, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the value of the Company's securities.
Sponda finances its operations partly with debt financing. Uncertainty in the finance market may mean that the price of the capital needed

<<<

 to carry out Sponda's growth strategy will increase and that it will be less readily available. Part of Sponda's debt financing has covenant or other conditions that are tied to Sponda's equity ratio and interest cover. These restrictions can

<<<

 affect the future funding of Sponda or require negotiations with financiers. Changes in equity and debt finance markets, cyclical fluctuations, major investments, or other changes in the conditions for operation and in Sponda's capital structure

<<<

 may mean that the Sponda's financing will need to be renegotiated, the terms of financing may weaken or Sponda may need to acquire additional financing. Considerable indebtedness might have significant effect on the operations of Sponda, such

<<<

 as (i) limit the Company's ability to raise additional finance on corresponding or more favorable financial and other terms than currently in force in order to finance its future working capital needs, investments, acquisitions or other general

<<<

 operative needs; (ii) require that a considerable part of the cash flow from operating activities of the Company be used for payments of the principle and interests of the debts, which would reduce the assets available for operating activities

<<<

 and development of the operations; (iii) make the Company more exposed to unfavorable financial conditions than its competitors, which could weaken the Company's competitiveness and (iv) expose the Company to interest rate increases. The Company

<<<

's ability to meet its debt servicing obligations in accordance with the planned schedule is partly dependent on financial, competitive and other factors that might be beyond its control. These factors might have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 the business operations, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the value of the Company's securities.
The expanding operations in Russia increase Sponda's foreign exchange risk.
Sponda's business may be adversely

<<<

 affected by the loss o f employees in key positions
The future operating results of Sponda depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of Sponda's senior management and personnel and therefore Sponda depends largely on its ability

<<<

 to recruit, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. However, there is significant competition for employees with the level of experience and
3

qualifications in real the estate business that Sponda depends upon, which could result

<<<

 in significant increased personnel costs. Accordingly, it may be increasingly difficult for Sponda to continue to hire and retain qualified personnel.
If Sponda cannot recruit, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel, it may be unable

<<<

 to compete effectively in the real estate business and Sponda's growth strategies may be limited, which in each case could have a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of Sponda.
Sponda is exposed to potential

<<<

 environmental liabilities
The main environmental impacts caused by Sponda's operations are in building development, repair services, property maintenance and the use of buildings. All properties must comply with the Finnish regulations in relation

<<<

 to, for example, environmental conditions, health and safety. Buildings as well as installations contained therein may violate the relevant statutory provisions or contain building materials detrimental to one's health. In order to restore

<<<

 conformity with the law, specific investments for the removal, upgrade or substitution of construction components or installations must be made.
Buildings may also be located on contaminated sites. The contamination of the soil can cause substantial

<<<

 delays in and increase the costs of construction projects (e.g., new construction, conversion, extension). Environmental factors such as deterioration, contamination, damage or encumbrance caused by a substance, energy, noise, vibration, radiation

<<<

, light, heat, smell or other hazardous effect caused to buildings or their use or which are caused by buildings and their use can have a direct influence on the value of the property and its profit situation. As owner of the land, Sponda can

<<<

 be held liable by third parties for deterioration, damage, encumbrance or other hazardous causes originating from the operation of the properties.
Any deterioration, contamination, damage, encumbrance, hazardous cause or material decrease in

<<<

 value of the property not known or not recognizable at the time of the purchase occurring at a later date can have a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of Sponda. Equally, the costs for the removal or

<<<

 clean up of the deterioration, contamination, damage, encumbrance or hazardous cause may be higher than anticipated. The above mentioned factors can have a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of Sponda

<<<

.
Risks relating to the Capital Securities
Words and expressions defined in the terms and conditions of the Capital Securities (the "Terms and Conditions") shall have the same meanings in this section, see "Terms and Conditions o f the Capital

<<<

 Securities".
No guarantee or security
The Capital Securities will not be obligations of anyone other than the Issuer and they will not be guaranteed by any other person or entity. No one other than the Issuer will accept any liability whatsoever

<<<

 in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay any amount due under the Capital Securities.
The Capital Securities are unsecured debt instruments and the holders of the Capital Securities (the "Holders") would be unsecured creditors in the

<<<

 event of the Issuer's bankruptcy.
Absence o f rating
The Capital Securities are not currently rated by any Rating Agency.
Perpetual nature o f the Capital Securities
The Capital Securities have no stated final maturity date and the Issuer is

<<<

 under no obligation to redeem the Capital Securities at any time. The Holders have no right to call for their redemption and, therefore, the Holders should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the

<<<

 Capital Securities for an indefinite period of time.
Issuer's right to redeem the Capital Securities
The Capital Securities may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer, in whole but not in part, at the principal amount, together with any Accrued

<<<

 Interest, on the Reset Date or on any Interest Payment Date thereafter.
In the event of a Change of Control, the Issuer may redeem the Capital Securities, in whole but not in part, at an amount equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount

<<<

 or (ii) the Make Whole Amount, in each case together with any Accrued Interest. The Capital Securities may also be redeemed at the option of the Issuer following a Tax Event or an Accounting Event, again at an amount equal to the greater of

<<<

 (i) the principal amount or (ii) the Make Whole Amount, in each case
4

together with any Accrued Interest. Consequently, the final maturity of the Capital Securities might be dependent on future changes in tax position or changes in accounting

<<<

 principles.
Issuer's right to defer interestpayments
The Issuer has the right to defer any payment of interest on the Capital Securities if the requirements for deferral set out in the "Terms and Conditions" of the Capital Securities are satisfied

<<<

. As a result, the sequence of future payments to the Holders is uncertain.
Subordination
The Capital Securities are unsecured, deeply subordinated obligations of the Issuer and are currently the most junior debt instruments of the Issuer, ranking

<<<

 behind all the claims of unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer and the claims of the creditors in respect of Issuer Subordinated Indebtedness, at least pari passu with any present or future outstanding New Capital Securities of the Issuer

<<<

, and in priority to payments to the holders of all classes of share capital of the Issuer in their capacity as such holders and any other obligation of the Issuer expressed by its terms to rank junior to the Capital Securities.
Consequently

<<<

, if the Issuer's financial condition were to deteriorate, the Holders could suffer direct and materially adverse consequences, including suspension of, on a cumulative basis, interest payments. If the Issuer were to liquidate (whether voluntarily

<<<

 or involuntarily), the Holders could lose their entire investment.
No prior public marketfo r the Capital Securities
The Capital Securities constitute a new issue of securities. Prior to the Listing, there has been no public market for the

<<<

 Capital Securities. Although application has been made to list the Capital Securities on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, there can be no assurance that an active public market for the Securities will develop, and if such a market were to develop

<<<

, the Lead Manager is under no obligation to maintain such a market.
The liquidity and the market prices for the Capital Securities can be expected to vary with changes in market and economic conditions, the financial condition and prospects

<<<

 of the Issuer and other factors that generally influence the market prices of securities. Such fluctuations may significantly affect the liquidity and the market prices of the Capital Securities, which may trade at a discount to the price at

<<<

 which the Holders purchased the Capital Securities.
Fixed interest rate
The Capital Securities bear interest on their outstanding principal at a Fixed Interest Rate prior to the Reset Date. A holder of a security with a fixed interest rate

<<<

 is exposed to the risk that the price of such security could fall as a result of changes in the market interest rate. While the nominal compensation rate of a security with a fixed interest rate is fixed during the life of such security or

<<<

 during a certain period of time, the current interest rate on the capital market (market interest rate) typically changes on a daily basis. If the market interest rate increases, the price of such a security typically falls, until the yield

<<<

 of such security is approximately equal to the market interest rate. If the market interest rate falls, the price of a security with a fixed interest rate typically increases, until the yield of such a security is approximately equal to the

<<<

 market interest rate.
Consequently, the Holders should be aware that movements of the market interest rate can adversely affect the price of the Capital Securities and can lead to losses for the Holders if they sell the Capital Securities during

<<<

 the period in which the interest rate of the Capital Securities is fixed.
Floating interest rate
The Capital Securities carry a floating interest date with a floor level from and including the Reset Date. A holder of a security with a floating

<<<

 interest rate is exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income. Fluctuating interest rate levels make it impossible to determine the yield of such securities.
No voting rights
The Capital Securities have

<<<

 no voting rights with respect to shareholders meetings of the Issuer. Consequently, the Holders cannot influence any decisions by the Issuer to defer payments of interest or to redeem the Capital Securities at the Reset Date or any other decisions

<<<

 by the Issuer's shareholders concerning, for instance, the capital structure of the Issuer.
5

No limitation on issuing additional debt There is no restriction on the amount of debt which the Issuer may issue that ranks senior or pari passu

<<<

 to the Capital Securities. Such issuance of further debt may reduce the amount recoverable by the Holders upon winding-up or insolvency of the Issuer, or may increase the likelihood that the Issuer elects to defer interest payments under the

<<<

 Capital Securities.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUER
General
The business name of the Company is Sponda Oyj (Plc). Sponda is a limited liability company

<<<

 incorporated on 23 October 1991, and is organized under the laws of the republic of Finland. The Company is registered in the Finnish Trade Register under the business identity code 0866692-3. Its registered address is Korkeavuorenkatu 45,

<<<

 FI-00130 Helsinki, Finland and telephone number +358 20 431 31.
History and development of the Issuer
Sponda is a real estate investment company that owns, leases and develops office, retail and logistics properties in the largest cities in

<<<

 Finland and Russia. The company is also looking for investment opportunities in the Baltic countries. Sponda develops attractive, tailored business environments that promote the customer's success. With its innovative, customer-oriented solutions

<<<

, Sponda actively creates best practices in the sector and acts with responsibility in developing the environment and the cityscape. On 30 June 2008 Sponda had a total of 210 properties, with an aggregate leasable area of about 1.4 million square

<<<

 meters. Of this 64 % were office and retail premises and 36 % logistics premises. On 30 June 2008 Sponda's entire property portfolio had a fair value of EUR 2,751.8 million.
Sponda was formed by the Bank of Finland in 1991 for the purpose of

<<<

 acquiring assets previously held for investment purposes by Skopbank Group, a Finnish commercial bank that historically acted as a central bank for Finnish savings banks. When Skopbank encountered severe liquidity problems, the Bank of Finland

<<<

 assumed its liabilities, and formed Sponda to assume the title to certain of Skopbank's properties and securities holdings. Certain other assets of Skopbank were transferred to other entities. The securities portfolio received by Sponda from

<<<

 Skopbank consisted of equity holdings in Finnish industrial companies. Sponda disposed of these holdings through a series of unrelated transactions effected from 1992 through the end of 1997.
In 1996, ownership of Sponda was transferred from

<<<

 the Bank of Finland to the State of Finland, acting through the Ministry of Finance. Sponda's mandate was changed from only liquidating its property holdings to adding value through efficient management and strategic development of its property

<<<

 portfolio, in anticipation of a future offering of shares in Sponda by the State of Finland.
In 1997, Sponda began implementing a strategy of developing a property portfolio focusing on high-quality properties located in prime commercial areas

<<<

. The property portfolio originally acquired by the Company from Skopbank consisted of a diversity of properties in various locations, and included a number of properties that did not conform to this strategy. As a result, Sponda undertook a

<<<

 series of strategic dispositions and acquisitions.
In 1998, Sponda's shares were listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange.
In 1999, Sponda sold its industrial and warehouse properties to Castrum Corporation, a logistics real estate company and

<<<

 acquired a number of properties from Leonia Bank including the City-Center building in Helsinki.
In April 2000, Sponda acquired Castrum Corporation, which was consolidated to Sponda.
In 2002, Sponda sold the Itäkeskus Shopping Mall in Helsinki

<<<

 to the Dutch real estate company Wereldhave N.V. and commenced redeveloping the City-Center building.
In June 2005, Kari Inkinen, MSc (Eng), was appointed as the President and CEO of Sponda.
In 2006, the City of Helsinki endorsed the rezoning

<<<

 plan enabling Sponda to start the renovations on City-Center. The work began in May 2006. Sponda and the Port of Helsinki signed an agreement according to which Sponda will be responsible for the construction of the logistics area at the new

<<<

 Vuosaari Harbour. The harbour will be opened for operation at the end of 2008.
In December 2006, Sponda acquired the entire share capital of property investment company Kapiteeli Plc for approximately EUR 943 million. The transaction further

<<<

 strengthened Sponda's position as one o f the leading actors in the Finnish property market.
In January 2007, Sponda arranged a rights issue. With the proceeds, approximately EUR 240 million net, Sponda refinanced part of the short-term credit

<<<

 raised to finance the Kapiteeli acquisition.
In March 2007, Sponda sold properties outside Sponda's strategic focus for EUR 401 million to a fund established by Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds and Niam Nordic Investment Fund III. The proceeds

<<<

 were used to refinance part of the
9

short-term credit raised to finance the Kapiteeli acquisition. Sponda will continue to manage the properties in the sold portfolio.
In March 2007, Sponda opened its own office in St Petersburg to support

<<<

 its strategic growth objectives in Russia and to strengthen its local market expertise. At the end of the year, Sponda owned three office buildings, one logistics center and two land sites in St Petersburg and Moscow regions of Russia.
In January

<<<

 2008, Sponda reduced its holding in Ovenia Oy, which provides property management services, from 55% to 45%.
In February 2008, Sponda announced that it established a new real estate fund called Sponda Real Estate Fund II Ky. The fund has a

<<<

 target size for its real estate investment of about EUR 200 million, and an initial investment portfolio of approximately EUR 70 million will be acquired for the fund. The fund will invest primarily in logistics, warehouse and industrial properties

<<<

 in medium-sized towns in Finland. Sponda will manage the fund and the property owned by the fund. Sponda also signed loan agreements with Swedbank for a 5-year EUR 100 million credit facility and with OKO Bank for a 7-year EUR 50 million credit

<<<

 facility. The funds were used to finance the Company's property development investments.
In March 2008, Sponda purchased the shopping centres Sun Paradise I and Sun Paradise II in Moscow for a total of about USD 109 million from LR Russia AB

<<<

. Furthermore in March 2008, Sponda signed agreements with Danske Bank A/S, Helsinki Branch for a 7-year EUR 150 million credit facility and with Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company for a 7-year EUR 50 million credit facility. They were

<<<

 taken to finance the Company's property development investments and investments in Russia.
In April 2008, Sponda signed a contract with the Port of Helsinki to build the Vuosaari Harbour Service Center. The project will be carried out in three

<<<

 phases, and the total investment for the first phase will be about EUR 12 million. In addition to the Service Center, Sponda is also building the PortGate logistics complex at the Vuosaari Harbour.
In May 2008, Sponda signed an agreement with

<<<

 the City of Tampere to build the Ratina shopping centre. As part of the agreement, Sponda is buying the plot of land for the shopping centre and the property on the Autotuonti block from the City of Tampere. The total investment in the shopping

<<<

 centre is estimated at some EUR 200 million.
In June 2008, Sponda issued EUR 130 million Capital Securities (hybrid bond) to Finnish institutional investors, with a coupon rate of 8.750%. The bond has no maturity, but Sponda is entitled to

<<<

 call the bond in five years time. The bond will, in its entirety, be treated as equity in Sponda's IFRS financial statements. The issue does not dilute the holdings of the Company's current shareholders. The Company will apply for public listing

<<<

 of the bond by the end of September 2008. Sponda has announced that the Company's long-term target is an equity ratio of 33% and that it would strengthen its solidity during 2008. The hybrid bond improves the Company's equity ratio. With this

<<<

 issue, and with the other financial arrangements agreed earlier this year, Sponda is ensuring that it has the required financing for its planned investments in 2008. Sponda also announced that in addition to the hybrid bond, Sponda is preparing

<<<

 sales of individual properties in the near future.
In July 2008, Sponda signed an agreement on the sale of the real estate company Kluuvikatu 8 to a real estate equity fund managed by Exilion Capital Oy for approximately EUR 42 million. The

<<<

 transaction was closed on 1 September 2008. This hotel property was not in line with Sponda's current strategy, which is to focus on owning office, retail and logistics properties.
Further in July 2008, Sponda purchased the Ducat II office

<<<

 property located in the centre of Moscow for USD 185 million from LR Ducat Holding AB. Several well-known international companies operate with long-term leases in the high-class office and retail premises on this property that was built in

<<<

 1997. Ducat II is part of an office complex, which comprises three modern office buildings. The purchase will be financed by unused credit facilities agreed in March 2008. Sponda aims to finance the Company's growth in Russia by selling some

<<<

 of its property in Finland.

There has been

Trend information
Business conditions - Finland
Activity in Finland's property market, which has been brisk, slowed down considerably during the second quarter

<<<

 of 2008. According to initial estimates from the Finnish Institute for Real Estate Economics (KTI), property transactions with a value of some EUR 2.7 billion had been carried out by the end of June, compared with EUR 2 billion at the end of

<<<

 March. Property yield requirements have shown a slight rise in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.
The vacancy rate for office premises is expected to rise slightly outside the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in the first half of 2009 when an estimated

<<<

 240,000 m2 of new office premises comes on the market. Rents are still expected to rise slightly during 2008.
The vacancy rate for retail premises remains low, even though according to Catella Property Group almost 200,000 m2 of new property

<<<

 is being built. This is considerably more than in the previous year, but nevertheless demand seems to exceed supply.
The vacancy rate for logistics premises is low, and there is a shortage of new property. Modern storage premises will be completed

<<<

 during 2008 to meet demand, and most of the vacant premises are expected to be unrenovated logistics premises. The new premises mean that rents for logistics premises will rise slightly.
Business conditions - Russia
Russia's rapid economic

<<<

 growth has made the country's real estate market one of the most dynamic in the world, which has attracted international property investors to the market for several years now. The global financial crisis has meant
14

that the volume of actual

<<<

 investments has levelled off, and correspondingly, the market has more properties for sale. According to Knight Frank, expectations of rental income have settled at 2007 levels.
Demand for office premises remains brisk in St Petersburg and

<<<

 Moscow and there is still a shortage of high-quality office premises, especially in Moscow. Because of this, rents are still expected to be on a positive course. Colliers estimates that some two billion square metres of new office premises

<<<

 will be completed in Moscow this year, but demand still exceeds supply. In St Petersburg, about 500,000 m2of new offices should be built this year, which is the equivalent of one third of the existing office premises in the city. The vacancy

<<<

 rate in both cities continues to be on average less than 5%.
According to the experts at Jones Lang LaSalle, the retail property market in Russia has expanded extremely rapidly due to strong economic growth and the resulting increase in consumption

<<<

. Moscow still has only 171 m2 of retail space per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with a European average of more than 200 m2/1,000 inhabitants. In St Petersburg the corresponding figure is 349 m2/1,000 inhabitants. In St Petersburg, construction

<<<

 of new retail property has in fact slowed down compared to recent years. The rise in rents has evened off, but the vacancy rate remains very low (2-5%).
The global economic slowdown has had an impact on development projects for logistics property

<<<

 in Russia. According to estimates by Knight Frank, international and major local property developers in the Moscow region have postponed new development projects until 2009. In St Petersburg, 630,000 m2 of new property is under construction

<<<

, which when completed will double the amount of logistics property on the market. The vacancy rate in St Petersburg stands currently at about 3%. In Moscow, there is no A-grade logistics property available, and the vacancy rate for B-grade

<<<

 property is also close to zero. Despite the high occupancy rates, rents are rising very moderately.
Influence o f Sponda's board o f directors and management on factors affecting the estimates
Sponda's board of directors and executive board

<<<

 may, in a certain time span, initiate changes in the rents charged by Sponda. Rent cuts may lead to higher demand for Sponda's premises, but on the other hand such cuts would also decrease profitability. Rent increases may, respectively, reduce

<<<

 the occupancy rates of and demand for Sponda's properties. Furthermore, resolutions by Sponda's board of directors and the executive board have an affect on certain costs items. Other factors expressed in Sections "Financial and trend information

<<<

, prospects - Trend information'' and "Financial and trend information, prospects - Prospects" are generally outside of the influence of the board of directors and executive board.
Prospects
In the Company's interim report for the period of

<<<

 1 January 2008-30 June 2008, the Company provided the following information on the prospects: Sponda expects its net operating income for 2008 to improve from the previous year. This estimate is based on the higher average rents and improved

<<<

 economic occupancy rate during 2007. The economic occupancy rate in 2008 is forecast to be the same as at the end of 2007. The change from the previous forecast, which expected the occupancy rate to improve from 2007, is because leasing of

<<<

 the logistics centre at Vuosaari Harbour has developed slower than expected. This will have no effect on Sponda's financial performance in 2008.
The earnings per share in 2008 will improve from the figure for 2007, after eliminating from the

<<<

 figures the fair value revaluations. Some EUR 150 million of capital is allocated to property development in 2008. Coupled with the rise in forecast financing costs, this means that the cash flow from operations per share, which includes capital

<<<

 gains and losses on the sale of properties, is expected to be slightly below the comparable figure for 2007.
Sponda confirms that this information on the prospects has been properly prepared on the basis stated and that the basis of accounting

<<<

 is consistent with Sponda's accounting policies.
There has been no material adverse change in the prospects of the Company since 30 June 2008.
