CEO remarks

Yngvar Tov Herbjørnssønn Norlandia Health & Care Group

<<<

 CEO

I am proud to present this very first an nual report from the newly created entity Norlandia Health & Care Group (NHC). NHC was created towards the end of 2016 when the ownership of Norlandia Care Group, Hero, Aberia and Kidsa was concentrated

<<<

 in this new corporation.
In the months since the company was created, I have worked with the manage ment teams of each of the four operating groups to assess areas of synergies and potential operational efficiencies. We will conduct in-depth

<<<

 analyses and explore new territories during the year 2017.
In my conversations with the dedicated employees of all our operating groups, it has become clear that these five core values are indeed common denominators: Quality, dignity, reliability

<<<

, innovation, and efficiency.
Our work has supported the notion that there is a strong industrial logic to the integration of the four broad opera tions that constitute NHC. The activities encompass core welfare services.
There are many synergies

<<<

. Our end users tend to be in a phase of their life when they are more fragile. As such, our em ployees have much in common in terms of how they approach and how they communicate with users.
Hero is 30 years old, and has a proud heritage as

<<<

 an operator of reception cent ers. Back in the 90s, Hero pioneered a model for user involvement in reception center management. Now, we are ready to export this model to other European countries both on sites and through other models for distribution

<<<

 of expertise.
In all countries where we operate, there is ongoing debate about the role of pri vate enterprise in the delivery of welfare services. Our message is that we and our competitors drive innovation and the

adoption of new methods

<<<

. Monopolies are rarely advantageous to society or to consumers, whether the monopolies are public or private. Competition brings transparency and sheds light on ineffi ciencies and suboptimal service delivery.
We need private enterprise to

<<<

 challenge the practices of the public sector to maintain a cohesive society with broad support for tax-funded welfare services. In fields such as healthcare, elderly care, education and childcare, access to services should be equal and the

<<<

 services should be of very good quality. On the delivery side, citizens should be concerned that their tax money is spent as efficiently as possible. In order to get the most out of the public spend, society should seek a mix of commercial

<<<

, ideal and public providers.
OUTLOOK
Preschools Our preschool operations are present in Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Nether lands. We seek differentiation from our competitors by emphasizing our desire to stimulate children to become more

<<<

 curious, more eager to discover and more creative.
We will supplant inefficient businesses in all markets. We seek growth through the acquisition of new properties in urban areas and we work systematically to increase occupancy at existing

<<<

 units.
Care In Sweden, the tender market in the field of nursing homes continues to be very active. Own operation of elderly care units is also a market that sees significant activity in Sweden. In Norway, mean while, the tender market is rather

<<<

 slow. Instead, it seems that the home care market appears to be an attractive one. We expect the home care market to be strong over the long term strong due to

4 NORLANDIA HEALTH & CARE GROUP AS

fundamental conditions. People generally have

<<<

 a preference to stay in their own homes into very old age. Also, there is a political desire for the same, motivated mostly by expected cost savings.
We expect one driver of care increasingly being delivered in the home rather than in institutions

<<<

 is the increased prolifera tion of sophisticated welfare technology. Greater user acceptance of self-care, tolerance of monitoring technologies, ever lower prices for sensors, processors and data storage, increased ability to process, analyze

<<<

 and act on data - these are all factors that will propel this evolu tion relentlessly forward.
While the home market today is rather fragmented and immature, we foresee a trend toward greater demands for quality systems and documented procedures

<<<

. As in the nursing home market, society will come to expect evidence-based practices that are well documented in electronic journal systems.
Adequate financing for home care needs to be provided for this area to grow. Cur rently, the sector

<<<

 suffers from unpredict ability and significant differences between municipalities. There are also surprising discrepancies between municipal cost lev els and contributions to private operators.
Integration services - Hero We see the potential

<<<

 for rapid growth within education. Across Europe, we see a large market with demand for a broad spectrum of training activities to inte grate immigrants in the workforce.

We are currently in the process of estab lishing reception centers in

<<<

 Germany and look forward to contribute with our skills and experience in this very large market.
Individual & family - Aberia We will seek growth primarily through actively bidding for local tenders. The market is expected to increase, particu

<<<

 larly within assisted care. We expect to be able to generate organic growth at our newly acquired units. The market in which Aberia operates continues to be a rather fragmented one. We foresee a consolidation within the segment, and plan on

<<<

 being one of the companies driv ing that process. A resulting challenge will be to rapidly realize the potential for operational synergies.
THE FUTURE I am very optimistic about the prospects for Norlandia Health & Care Group. We serve society

<<<

 in areas that are complex and challenging. The forces of demogra phy will make the wisdom of using our services ever more evident. An attitude of curiosity and a bold orientation to developing the enterprise augurs well for the aggressive employment

<<<

 of digital so lutions to enhance customer experiences, lighten the workload and cut costs.
Fundamental to all operations of NHC is the profound appreciation of the dignity of the individual. We work diligently to train new and old employees

<<<

 in the think ing expressed in our value statements. The great quality experienced by our end users will be the best testament to our

We believe there is substantial potential for organic growth from the current plat form in the areas of translation

<<<

. In 2016, we acquired an interpreter service in Fin CEO land. Our ability to skillfully use technol ogy to efficiently deploy the capabilities will be useful. We have translators with a mastery of a great number of languages.

Our project Knowledge & innovation has been a central part of our work through 2016. Key goals of this identity project are to get an even greater number of competent and dedicated people

<<<

 to want to work with us and to have more parents want their children to go to one of our preschools. We have worked with Knowledge & innovation in Norway and Sweden since 2015 and it was launched internally in both countries in 2016. We launched

<<<

 Knowledge & innovation externally in early 2017. Our ambition for Knowledge & innovation is that children who attend a Norlandia preschool will develop a greater level of curiosity, a stronger drive to explore, and a more intense urge to create

<<<

 new ideas. Our slogan is "Let the discoveries begin!"
Norlandia Quest is an annual event, and an integral part of Knowledge & innova tion. The event unites all the preschools in Norlandia in all countries where we operate in a common project

<<<

 with the aim of creating commitment, enthusi asm and joy. In 2016/2017 the theme was film. The children got to explore the medium of film in different ways - they watched films, learned about making movies and also got to make films them selves

<<<

. This was an exciting and creative event for both the children and our em ployees. Norlandia Quest also generated a great deal of publicity for us.
In 2016 we launched a program for systematic and critical reflection on own practices. The program

<<<

 was implemented in both Norway and Sweden. The pro gram is meant to function as a tool for our pedagogical staff members in order to strengthen the adult role. The feed back has been positive. We believe that systematic and thorough reflection

<<<

 on our pedagogic work lays the foundation for good educational quality.

Norlandia's competence policy program has been an important part of our work during 2016 in Norway and this process is ongoing in Sweden in 2017. The overall goal of the

<<<

 policy is to emphasize that unit managers should help to mobilize and develop the competence that exists, so that the individual's competence has the possibility to develop and be used properly. This helps us ensure that we have the right person

<<<

 in the right place!
Our ambitions for further growth in Sweden and Norway are high. But we will grow sensibly, putting quality first. Com panies acquired by Norlandia should feel well taken care of in their new family.
We will continue our

<<<

 work on becoming the preferred provider. We want to see a smile on each child's face when they walk through the doors to our preschools.
Norway Currently we care for around 6800 child ren in 88 preschools in Norway, counting both Norlandia

<<<

 and Kidsa.
In Bergen we own Kidsa - a company that runs and develops 28 preschools. A common feature for the Kidsa preschools is that they strive to operate on children's terms. This means that the individual child's wishes, needs and resources

<<<

 have an impact on the development of the pedagogical work in preschools.
In 2016 Kidsa experienced some nega tive publicity when questions about the company's finances appeared in media. This led to Bergen municipality conduct ing a financial

<<<

 review, which concluded that there was absolutely no reason for any reactions.
In 2016 we have fully renovated Glass verket preschool in Bærum municipality. The original building is from 1894 and in this refurbishing process it has been important

<<<

 for us to preserve the building's

It was encouraging to see that we experi enced improvement in parent surveys at preschools in Oslo that earlier have been

<<<

 run by the city, like Ospa, Frydenlund and Bjørnåsen.
Paradiset preschool in Nordland has shown impressive and targeted work on prevention of sick leave among employ ees. In 2016 Paradiset preschool had record low sickness absence. Employees

<<<

 state that the good working environment and the feeling of being a part of a family makes them happy at work. This is an inspiration to the rest of our organisation.
Sweden Currently we care for a little more than 3300 children at 50 preschools

<<<

 in Sweden.

2016 has been an important year for our preschool operations in Sweden. We have taken a major step in developing the organisation with the establishment of a new regional management structure. This means that we have divided the

<<<

 Swedish operation into three regions, each with its own region manager. Having three regions which has the size and management capacity to develop and integrate new preschools marks the start of a new era for us in Sweden. In addition to the

<<<

 organisational develop ment we also celebrated our 50th preschool operation in Sweden and the launch of Knowledge & innovation at our operations.
We had several exciting start-ups in Sweden last year. Two of them were Eventyrsbåten and Ferdinand

<<<

 preschools which are both Kids2home preschools. We have worked with integrating Kids2home since the acquisition in 2015. The integration project has focused on how to let the concept benefit from the

systems and management approaches of Norlandia

<<<

. The mission of Kids2home is to "make families with small children happier by making their everyday life easier". All of our Kids2home sites have been built according to the same physical layout, which is designed for preschool operations.

<<<

 We pay significant attention to all matters related to food: Our food tend to be biodynamically produced and cooked on site. It is also possible for parents to purchase take-home dinners.
In Staffanstorp, Skåne, we have an operation with an

<<<

 interesting concept that delivered good results in 2016. Lilla och stora Emilia is both a preschool and a school. All learning at this site is based on the interaction between the children, the environment and the teach ers. Own experiences

<<<

 and the children's own curiosity form the basis for learning.

Since merging all our elderly care divisions in Norway and Sweden and patient hotels

<<<

 into one in the fall of 2015, we have been working on exploiting all the synergies be tween these business areas and countries. In 2016 we started our journey on develop ing from being a traditional health and care provider to an innovative

<<<

, forward-looking division. Welfare technology, extended home care and meeting the need for sev eral health care workers will dominate our future operations within Care.
We are proud of our work with the Patient Safety Program throughout 20

<<<

16. The program will be implemented at all of our nursing homes in Norway and Sweden. We are also working on including this program in our home care services.
Enabling elderly people to live at home as long as possible is something municipalities

<<<

 in Norway, Sweden and Finland are prior itizing. Home care services will be a major focus for us in 2017, and in the years to come, in all three countries. In Norway we are already well established in this area.

 our work with the program at several conferences abroad. One major conference was the National Forum on Quality Improvement in Health Care in Orlando, Florida held by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). Oppsalhjemmet will participate

<<<

 in the program's key priority area for 2017, emphasizing nutrition.
In 2016 we continued implementing Five wishes for dignity, a Norlandia concept developed at Oppsalhjemmet. Five wishes is a so-called living will, which enables residents and

<<<

 their families to make distinct choices about treatment, care provision and end of life support. We are now cooperating with Lovisenberg hospits on developing the concept so that we can make it available at several nursing homes. Developing

<<<

 multicultural dialogue tools is part of this work.
In accoradance with Oslo municipality's new policy of running their own nursing homes, Madserudhjemmet was reverted to the city of Oslo in 2016 as expected.

Elderly care Norway In Norway,

<<<

 the government continues the development of the Coordination Reform (samhandlingsreformen). As a conse quence, Norlandia Care has expanded its core business from being only a provider of instution-based elderly care to more broadly relieving

<<<

 the public sector. With our innovative thinking and practical ori entation, we can assist public health and care services to implement changes that society needs fast.
A major priority for us is to implement the Patient Safety Program in all

<<<

 of our nursing homes in order to increase patient safety and satisfaction. We have continued to cooperate with the Norwegian Directorate of Health Services regarding this program through 2016. Oppsalhjemmet was the first nursing home in Norway

<<<

 to adopt this program. Stephan Ore, the head physician

In Oslo, there are four health houses, and we run one of them; Ullern Health House. The health houses are a consequence of legislation pushing responsibilities for certain patient groups

<<<

 from the hospitals over to the municipalities. The health houses have patients who need short-time treatment or rehabilitation. In 2017, we moved into a new, modern and environ mentally efficient nursing home. For the coming year we will work

<<<

 on incorporating welfare technology at Ullern Health House and finding the right synergies between the health house, nursing homes and our home care services.
One of our new areas of activity within welfare technology is safety alarms. We participated

<<<

 in a tender competition on providing safety alarm services in Asker and Bærum municipalities, and we are proud of becoming number two in that competition.

Getting established with solid technological collaboration partners has been important to us in order to enter this segement.
We acquired 100% of

<<<

 Oslo Helse og Om sorg in 2016, and as of January 1, 2017 the operation was included as a part of Norlandia and rebranded to Norlandia Home Care. This acquisition makes us one of the largest home care providers in Norway. Early in 2017 we got

<<<

 a concession for operating in three municipalities in Nedre Romerike and in Bergen. A major effort was made in late 2016 and early 2017 to document quality procedures in Oslo Helse and Omsorg consistently with the rest of Norlandia. As a result

<<<

, we are proud of being one of the very few pro viders of home care services to become ISO certified in Norway.
We have acquired Oseberg Medical Clinic in Tønsberg in collaboration with the well-known patient and caregiver organi zation LHL

<<<

 (Landsforeningen for hjerteog lungesyke). This acquisition gives us an entry into specialist health service.

Recruiting qualified employees is a priority to us. We contribute extensively to educa tion in the care field in Norway. With over

<<<

 100 students from various fields of study, including medicine, in training at our operations we contribute to recruit and ensure competence for the future.
Elderly care Sweden It is a tough and competitive market in Sweden, characterized by

<<<

 a large number of tenders and challenging expectations. Limiting profits or dividends in the elderly care sector is still a part of the political debate. The Reepalu commission suggested severe limitations for private provision of elderly care

<<<

 services.
We have decided to pursue building our own nursing homes in Sweden. For 2017 our aim is to initiate three building projects. In February 2017 we signed the first contract with a contractor which will build our first operation. This

<<<

 will be a building containing a nursing centre and a kindergarten, which is part of our "Welfare in a box" concept.

The Kosmolandia project was completed in 2016. This project was about integrating Kosmo into Norlandia and has involved a great

<<<

 number of people. It has resulted in Norlandiasattet, where the best parts from Kosmo and the existing Norlandia concept have been brought together.
Patient hotels Our patient hotels at St. Olav in Trond heim, Arstaviken in Stockholm and Tampere

<<<

 in Finland have had a stable year through 2016. Development and innovation was the headline of our pa tient hotel conference which was held in 2016. Employees from Norway, Sweden and Finland participated with the aim to come up with ways of

<<<

 developing the concept of patient hotels further. We will continue this work in 2017.
As of March 2017 we are participating in two new tenders in Finland, in Turku and Tampere. And we are looking into several possible operations in Norway,

 Finland and the UK.

Tor Brekke Hero CEO

Integration services

In 2017, we celebrate our 30th anniver sary. We look back at our eventful and unique history within our field with pride, where quality always has been

<<<

 a major priority. We opened our first reception centre in 1987 in Ytre Arna in Bergen, to accommodate refugees arriving from Chile. Today we are the largest operator of reception centres in Scandinavia and one of the largest in the world. We

<<<

 offer services aimed towards asylum seekers, refugees and immigrants. We are proud to be the only company in Norway that can offer a continuum of services for these groups. From the time when they first arrive in Norway, continuing with their

<<<

 stay at a reception centre, and fur ther on to integration in society through employment and education.
Over the years we have developed a ground-breaking method where we let the residents get involved in operating the reception centres; this

<<<

 approach has greatly influenced the development of the Norwegian reception system. In the year 2002 resident participation was imple mented as a government requirement at all Norwegian reception centres. Believing in empowerment and regarding

<<<

 our resi dents as valuable resources continue to be an important part of our mindset and approach. Because of our commitment to resident involvement we are also consid ered a trusted partner for the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI

<<<

).
In 2011, we developed a concept named Sammen for sikkerhet (Together for safety). The core element of the concept is that we as part of our commitment to resident participation talk with refugees and asylum seekers about Norwegian gender

<<<

 roles in dialogue groups. Initially the purpose of this project was to pre vent sexual assault and rape. The main idea behind the concept is to engage participants in an effort for safety. The dialogue groups are now well incorporat ed in information

<<<

 work in the reception

centres. Meeting people with respect and empowering people through knowledge and responsibility is an important part of our philosophy. We experience great results with Sammen for sikkerhet. The concept is also well known

<<<

 outside Norway. After the mass sexual assault scandal in Koln in 2015 we had a large number of media requests from around the world. They all wanted to learn more about our concept.
In Hero, we experience a willingness to contribute, great

<<<

 employee engagement and a special ability to mobilize our forces when needed. These strong features are all a part of the legacy left by our former leader, Ahmed Bozgil, who passed away in 2013. Bozgil himself was a refugee; he came to Norway

<<<

 as a political refugee from Turkey in 1986. He had a clear idea and vision about how a reception centre should be run.
Since the change of ownership in 2014, when we became part of the company Hospitality Invest, we have experienced continued

<<<

 growth in Norway and the establishment of Hero Sweden the same year.
In addition to our reception centres, our core business also consists of language services and education centres in Norway and Sweden. Hero Tolk was established in 2005, offering

<<<

 interpretation services. In 2006 we established Hero Kompetanse, where we support the development of competence throughout the process from being a job seeker to becoming a wanted resource in the workplace.
In 2016 Hero Tolk and Hero Kompetanse

<<<

 were established as separate corpora tions, and both companies had very good activity and revenue levels in their first year as separate corporations.

Helsingin Tulkkipalvelut Oy, a company offering interpretation services, was acquired in 2016 and rebranded as Hero Tolk Oy. This acquisition gave us impor tant access to the Finnish market for

<<<

 interpreting services.

Throughout 2016 the number of asylum seekers in Norwegian reception centres has been halved. In late January of 2016, almost 29,000 residents were housed in centres in Norway. In January of 2017, the figure was just

<<<

 below 13,000.

The major European refugee crisis in 2015 contributed to the establishment of several thousand new spots at Hero reception centres in Norway and Sweden. This increase continued into the first half of 2016. Then, in the second

<<<

 half of 2016, several of our reception centres were closed down as the number of arrivals dropped to the lowest levels in many years. We established the last reception centres in June and received the first contract terminations in August.

<<<

 The tremendous change of course was very demanding for the organization. Close cooperation with health and safety representatives and employee repre sentatives was given high priority during this process.

In 2017 we plan to continue our growth

<<<

 in Sweden and Finland. We are also excited about expanding to Germany. In the beginning of 2017 we recieved confirmation that we had won three contracts to operate reception centres in Germany.
Our core business deals with some of the most

<<<

 urgent social tasks that modern democracies face: Migration, integra tion and employment. Our model of successful integration through resident participation and cooperating closely with different public agencies has been proven to function

<<<

 well. We will continue to seek to export our model so that our best practices are spread and developed in more countries in Europe.

Individual & family

Since

<<<

 the foundation in 2010 Aberia's philosophy has been to assist people with needs for support to live their lives with dignity. All our services are provided within the Scandinavian welfare model. This includes children, youth and adults. Our

<<<

 core service offering is divided into two main categories. One area is focused on child welfare, family homes, foster care and minor refugees in Norway and in Sweden. The other main area is care services and respite care services, which we

<<<

 offer nationwide in Norway.
The child welfare sector in Norway is complex. 54.000 children and youths between 0 and 22 years are in need of some level of care services. 40 % is taken care of outside of their homes, either in foster care or

<<<

 in institutions, whereas 60% is taken care of by their own families with assistance from service providers.
The Norwegian state and the municipality of Oslo are responsible for all childcare in institutions in Norway. They are operating through

<<<

 their own services and through tenders. This market has three types of providers: Private, non-profit and govern mental. The private part of the market is driven by four major players: Aleris, Hu mana, Team Oliva and Aberia Healthcare.
We are

<<<

 able to provide a sustainable quality due to predictability and stability for the children in our care. We achieve this because of loyal and highly competent staff with predictable working schedules. Our devotion to quality also shows in the

<<<

 results of external supervisions from different external authorities. In 2016 we had no deviations in any of our child welfare institutions.
There are almost 63.000 people who need care around the clock in Norway. 22.000 are taken care of in

<<<

 their own homes and 41.000 are cared for in institu tions. These numbers are expected to increase for all age groups. There is also

an increasing demand for respite care, throughout the country.
Within care services and respite care ser vices

<<<

 we operate as a private enterprise in the public sector. We have approximately 20 tender processes going on at all times. We provide services for people who have special needs or who are unable to take care of themselves and are dependent on

<<<

 practical or personal assistance in order to undertake everyday tasks. We have flexible working schedules enabling efficient op erations and at the same time maintaining high quality services.
We are dedicated to proper employee per formance

<<<

 in the broadest sense, with high quality and dignity for everyone involved. We strive to be good role models in leader ship at all levels. An expressed ambition is to strengthen the job enrichment for our personnel; we expect to improve the

<<<

 ser vice to those we provide care for as a result. We are continuously working on quality improvement. We recognize employee satisfaction as an essential part of our qual ity work, because there is a lot of research which shows that job enrichment

<<<

 and quality correlate. Permanent employment and our commitment to having the majority of our employees in full-time positions are important elements in creating dedicated and satisfied employees.
In 2016 we have conducted surveys on employee

<<<

 satisfaction and customer satisfaction, both with satisfying results. Average score on both surveys were around 85 % satisfaction.
We dedicate significant effort towards improvement in treatment practices, pro viding meaningful activities and

 the right care for those we are responsible for. It is rewarding to see that our work provides great benefits to individuals and to society.

 throughout Norway. At the end of the year we just had a few children left in our care. Our important work for these vulnerable children led to a new framework agreement with the state.

Aberia in Sweden Aberia has operated in Sweden for several

<<<

 years, mainly within child welfare. Aberia is now ready for growth in our core seg ments. We are well prepared for growth within child welfare services and family homes for 2017. Establishing sheltered housing and respite care services are

<<<

 also included in our scheduled plans for operations in Sweden.

We also made several acquisitions in 2016 and we are pleased to see that we continue to expand. Stenimed AS was acquired in April, a company providing nationwide living and care

<<<

 services for people with special needs. In September we bought Jentespranget AS, a child wel fare institution located in Stord. This is a small company with a solid reputation and an exciting concept targeting girls only, with the aim to make

<<<

 them independent and capable of taking care of themselves.
At the start of 2016 there were 736 minor refugees in care centres all over the coun

We have great expectations for the coming year. Two large tenders from the Health and Welfare Agency

<<<

 in the municipality of Oslo are scheduled for 2017. Under the terms of this contract it is left up to the users to make their own choice of care provider. This means we have to work differently and with higher intensity on marketing our services

<<<

, in addition to our con tinuous work on improving user satisfaction.
Our achievements and new acquisitions during 2016 have brought us to a point where we are ready to expand all of our services nationwide in Norway in 2017.

In both Norway

The Netherlands Ahead of the general election in March, there was a slightly hesitant attitude in the market about how a possible new government

<<<

 would organize childcare in the future. This has influenced some initiatives in our growth strategy. The final composition of the new government coalition will also influence and possibly give some new directions to our strategy in the Netherlands

<<<

.
Nevertheless, we are pleased to see that our operations have experienced signifi cant growth also in 2016 and according to our plans. We are proud of successfully passing the ISO certification in 2016. Our kindergartens in the Dutch market

<<<

 are a solid and robust part of Norlandia and they continue to have a strong finan cial foundation.
When acquiring new entities, it has been important for us to find companies that are a good match with us. This may entail that they have operations

<<<

 which quickly

and efficiently can become an integrated part of Norlandia, thus taking advan tage of our systems. Alternatively, the acquisition targets may be more mature companies that we can exchange knowl edge with.
Early in 2016, Kindex

<<<

 was rebranded to Norlandia; name and brand were changed, and a concept in line with that of Norlandia is being established through divisional exchange of knowledge.
Quickly understanding customer behaviour and predicting their needs is important

<<<

, particularly as we operate in a tougher market in the Netherlands than in Nor way or Sweden. We continue to deliver on quality and operational excellence. The systematic work with quality in the Netherlands still impresses us, and has spread

<<<

 throughout the Norlandia system.
There are many similarities between Nor way, Scandinavia, and the Netherlands, especially in terms of employee attitudes

and culture at the workplace. Sharing competencies among employees and transferring

<<<

 valuable practices from one place to another is something we have made sure to benefit from in 2016.
Urban areas in the Nordic countries are likely to be influenced by European solutions in more densely populated areas. The knowhow of combining

<<<

 Nordic welfare solutions - securing good quality independently of social and economic status - with effective central European service models, provides a growth model we believe is needed both in our core markets of the Nordics and in our new

<<<

 and developing markets.
Good cooperation and a mutual under standing between the Nordic countries and the Netherlands forms part of our rather ambitious growth strategy for the future.

Finland In 2016 the Finnish economy showed signs of recovery

<<<

. This has a significant ef fect on the market. In politics, the munic ipalities and the national administration has continued to search for new solutions in order to speed up the recovery and reverse the descending economy.
The service voucher

<<<

 system has contin ued to grow in 2016. This changes the dynamics of the sector and gives a larger part of the population the possibility to afford private care.
It is evident to us that private kinder gartens are more cost effective than the

<<<

 public kindergartens in Finland and at the same time they also provide great quality and customer experience. We continued work in 2016 to prepare for ISO certifica tion for our Finnish operations.
We have rebranded our Tenava operations in

<<<

 Finland to Norlandia at the beginning of 2017. The process has been successful and well received by the employees.

The introduction of our employee survey Great place to work was well received. The results were positive and they gave us some

<<<

 good indications for future development.
Overall, Finland shows strengthened revenue and profit due to an impres sive turnaround initiative of our Finnish management. For new acquisitions in Finland our strategy has not changed. We are especially

<<<

 looking at well-run businesses with long traditions which are under pressure to deliver on increasing expectations. Through 2016 we have also focused on establishing relationships and key partnerships that will enable us to grow further through

<<<

 our own new build ing program. We see that there is great potential for further growth and that we are on the right track. We are thinking long-term, building solid operations with good quality for both children and par ents in the least mature

<<<

 private childcare market of the Nordics.

The board of directors' report 2016

Reorganization and refinancing Over the last years, we have observed a positive development across all the care segments in which we are operating, and at the same time, all companies

<<<

 have entered into new geographical areas. We strongly believe that the core segments in which we operate will continue to experi ence a positive trend in the Nordic and European countries in the years to come. In order to arrange for the continued

<<<

 growth within the care segments, Hospi tality Invest ( ultimate mother company of the ownership sphere) went through a major restructuring process in 2016 involving consolidation of all holdings within the preschools, care, individual & family

<<<

 and integration services segments under a fully-owned and newly incorpo rated subsidiary named Norlandia Health & Care Group AS ("NHC").
As part of the reorganization, NHC ac quired all outstanding minority share holdings in Norlandia Care

<<<

 Group AS, Aberia Healthcare AS, Hero Group AS and Kidsa Drift AS, resulting in a clean corporate structure with fully owned subsidiaries under NHC. The new group will become a leading player in the Nordic private care market with more than

<<<

 eight thousand employees and revenues of more than NOK 5 billion. As part of the restructuring, outstanding bank- and bond debt in the four operating compa nies, amounting to NOK 844 million was refinanced, including the NOK 650 million bond

<<<

 loan issued by Norlandia Care Group AS (OSE: NCG01).
The transactions were financed through the issuance of a new bond loan consist ing of a NOK-tranche of NOK 750 million at a rate of NIBOR + 450 basis points and a SEK-tranche of SEK 1 10

<<<

0 million at a rate of STIBOR + 450 basis points. The loan is a senior secured callable bond with maturity in 2021 and a maximum loan amount of NOK 2 500 million. A list ing process for the bond loan has been

initiated and is expected to be

<<<

 concluded with a listing on Oslo Stock Exchange within end of 1H 2017.
The restructuring and refinancing has created a major player within the Nordic care service sector, which will be even stronger and more robust than before. The new bond

<<<

 loan offers additional liquidity and creates a stable platform for further growth, both organically and through new acquisitions. The Group will strive to utilize synergies between the various operating groups, improving the quality of the

<<<

 Group's services further and at the same time continue to be an efficient and reliable service provider to our contract counterparts.
Operations Norlandia Health & Care Group AS is a provider of healthcare services in North ern Europe. During

<<<

 2016, the Group had operations in four countries; Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands. About 80% of the operations is located in Norway and Sweden, and the headquar ter is located in Oslo. The Group operates under four different brands

<<<

; Norlandia, Kidsa, Aberia and Hero, and delivers services within the four segments; Pre schools, Care, Integration Services and Individual & Family.
Preschools The Preschools segment includes the preschool activities within Norlandia Preschools

<<<

 AS and Kidsa Barnehager AS. The segment includes over 210 preschool units in Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, with close to 15,000 kids and 3,200 employees. The segment has experienced solid growth over the past years, both through

<<<

 acquisitions and through establishing new units.
Care The Care segment provides individually focused care and has grown to become one of the largest Nordic providers

ANNUAL REPORT 2016 21

with close to 50 units, more than 3,300 residents

<<<

 and over 2,650 employees. 40 of the units are located in Sweden, 7 in Norway and 1 in Finland. The segment experienced a challenging year in 2016 with loss of certain contracts in both Sweden and Norway. In addition, increased focus on price

<<<

 in recent tender processes, in combination with a high level of competition, is puffing pressure on operating margins.
Integration Services The integration services are offered through Hero Group AS. Hero Norge was established in 1987 and has

<<<

 grown to be come the largest private provider of care services related to forced migrants, refu gees and asylum seekers in the Nordics. The group has extensive competence and experience acquired through 30 years of operations. The service offering

<<<

 includes; · Reception centers for asylum seekers · Interpretation services · Training and education services
The group had more than 60 centers in Norway and Sweden per year-end 2016 with a total capacity for offering services to approximately

<<<

 10,000 people.
The Integration services segment has been through a turbulent year with record high influx of asylum seekers in the beginning of 2016 and record low number of arrivals at the end of the year. The dramatic changes in the market

<<<

 con ditions has been a massive challenge for the organization, however, the group has managed their tasks well and remains an important partner to the immigration authorities in both Norway and Sweden.
Individual & family The services within

<<<

 the Individual & family segment are provided by Aberia Healthcare AS - a Nordic provider of health-, welfare- and care services for children and young as well as people with physical and mental disabilities.

The group was established in 2

<<<

010 and has grown to become a significant player in the Nordic market. The group has over 700 employees and offers services to more than 180 individuals. The services are divided in three main segments: Aberia #UNG offering services related

<<<

 to childcare institutions and foster homes; Aberia #PROFF focusing on care services for people within all age groups with physical and mental disabilities; and Aberia Samson offering respite care and per sonal assistance. Most of the contracts

<<<

 in the group are with the government, municipalities or city district authorities. The company has a growth strategy and is actively seeking growth through tender processes and acquisitions.
Real estate The Real estate operations have so far

<<<

 been operated as an integrated part of the respective segments, but was recently established as a separate operating seg ment. All existing real estate within the group are planned sold or transferred to the newly established company named

<<<

 Care Properties AS. All future initiatives related to purchase, development and sale of real estate will be handled by this segment.
Comments to the consolidated financial statements The Group's revenues increased from NOK 3,940.4 million in

<<<

 2015 to NOK 5,177.5 million in 2016. The figures are not directly comparable, as the 2015 financial statement did not include full year operations for Aberia Healthcare. Moreover, the segment Integration Services experienced a significant growth

<<<

 compared to 2015. Net profit decreased from NOK 277.3 million in 2015 to NOK 194.9 million in 2016. Last year's profit included a gain of NOK 149.9 million relating to the sale of shares in PPP III.

Staff costs increased from NOK 2,557.7 million

<<<

 in 2015 to NOK 3,352.9 million in 2016, implying a 0.1 percentage point de crease in staff cost, measured as percent of revenues. The EBITDA margin for the year 2016 ended at 7.4 % compared to 6.2 % in 2015.
Cash flow from operating activities

<<<

 de creased from NOK 262.6 million in 2015 to NOK 249.3 million in 2016. Net cash used in investing activities declined from NOK -183.6 million in 2015 to NOK -33.3 million in 2016. Net cash received from financing activities amounted to NOK

<<<

 512.1 million, primarily relating to the issuance of a new bond loan.
The Group's liquidity reserve as of 31.12.2016 amounted to NOK 1,060.2 million. The Group also has additional reserves through tap issue possibilities on the bond loan.
The

<<<

 Group's long-term debt amounted to NOK 2,058.7 million, of which NOK 2,272.0 million is bond loans in Norlandia Health & Care Group.
Total assets of the Group increased from NOK 3,277.5 million in 2015 to NOK 4,239.3 million in 2016. The equity

<<<

 ratio decreased from 38.1% in 2015 to 11.4% in 2016. The significant decrease in equity ratio relates to the restructuring of the Group completed in December 2016. For a detailed description, please see note 11 in the Financial statement.
The

<<<

 Group's financial position is sound and adequate to settle short-term obliga tions with the Group's liquid assets.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Stand ards (IFRSs

<<<

) as adopted by EU. There were no material changes in accounting policies during the year affecting the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Use of Alternative Performance Measures Alternative Performance

<<<

 Measures (APM) is understood as a financial measure of historical or future financial perfor mance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework. Norlandia

 Health & Care Group reports certain alternative performance measures in its financial reports as a supplement to the financial statements reported in accordance with IFRS. The APMs are used consistently over time and accompanied by com paratives

 for the corresponding previous periods.

Going concern In accordance with the Norwegian Ac counting Act §3-3a, we confirm that the financial statements have been prepared under the assumption of a going

<<<

 concern. This assumption is based on profit fore casts for 2017 and the Group's long-term strategic forecasts. The Group's economic and financial position is sound.
Future challenges and market outlook We expect to see fairly stable develop

<<<

 ment of the operations during 2017. The Preschools segment is expected to con tinue a stable growth through the launch own projects as well as acquisition of new units. Continuous focus on improv ing quality and efficiency is expected to support

<<<

 a stable margin development going forward.
The Care segment is expected to have a more challenging year. We expect a

flat development of revenues as some existing contracts are phased out and replaced by new tenders won. Continued pressure

<<<

 on margins may lead to a tem porary decline in the segments overall margin level. Growth initiatives within own projects and health care technology may contribute on the positive side. The long term underlying drivers within the segment continue

<<<

 to remain very solid.
The Integration services segment is expected to see a solid drop in revenues within Reception Centers, whereas Inter pretation and Education are expected to continue their solid growth path, replac ing part of the shortfall

<<<

 within Reception Centers. The Group has just established a presence in Germany and within a short period won three Reception Center contracts. Market intelligence indicates that there will be high tender activity in the German market in 20

<<<

17, which may lead to further contract wins. We expect limited contribution from these activities in 2017 as the entry into a new market will require some investments, however, it may lead to a positive contribution in 2018 and onwards.
The

<<<

 Individual & Family segment is expected to get a soft start to the year on the back of a challenging environment within childcare services in Norway and Sweden. However, the Company has won a large contract in the childcare segment which is

<<<

 expected to increase the group's market share in second half of 2017. We continue to see strong demand for assisted living services and expect to see continued growth within the segment. We expect the ongoing market consolida tion to continue

<<<

 and will seek to be an active participant in the process.
The Real Estate segment is expected to develop as planned in 2017. Several properties are planned sold during 2017, which will generate profits. The Group is also building up an organization

<<<

 which

will handle management, development and sale of properties in the future.
An identified risk within this segment is the proposed changes in the Swedish tax regime, which may have a negative effect on future profits within this segment

<<<

, if implemented.
There are no other known events ex pected to have significant effect on the Group's performance in 2017.
Financial risk Overall view on objectives and strategy The Group is exposed to financial risk in different areas, including

<<<

 exchange rate risk. The goal is to reduce the financial risk as much as possible. The Group's cur rent strategy does not include the use of financial instruments to hedge exchange rate risk; however, each company in the Group is continuously

<<<

 assessing this.
Market risk The Group's business, results of opera tions and financial conditions depend on conditions prevailing for childcare and care services in the Nordic region, in particular, public policies and the political climate

<<<

. The demand for the Group's services will be dependent on inter alia the birth rates and the longevity in the regions where the group operates. Inte gration services will in addition to politi cal decisions be affected by geopolitical situations

<<<

, which may lead to reduced number of immigrants and asylum seek ers. Demand for private care services may decrease depending on a number of demographic and economic factors.
Exchange rate risk The Group has operations in Norway, Sweden, Finland

<<<

 and the Netherlands, and is expected to enter new geographies in the future. Currency fluctuations may have a negative effect on the Group's financial conditions and results of operations. The Group is predominantly

ANNUAL REPORT 2016 23


<<<


exposed to the SEKNOK exchange rate as the financial statements are presented in NOK and around 40% of revenues are generated in SEK. However, the Group has a corresponding share of costs in SEK and about 58% of its bond debt is denominated

<<<

 in SEK, both representing natural hedges to the operations. The Group as a small but growing exposure to the EURNOK exchange rate as opera tions in the Netherlands and Finland are growing. The Group is monitoring the exposure and will consider

<<<

 to hedge this exposure in the future. The Group is fur ther exposed to changes in interest rates as most long-term debt in the Group is subject to floating interest rates. The Group has not established any interest rate hedging mechanisms.

<<<


Credit risk The risk of losses on receivables is consid ered very low in the Group as a considerable part of revenues is towards governmental entities and municipalities. The Group has not yet experienced significant losses on receivables.

<<<


Liquidity risk The Group's liquidity is good, enabling each Group company to handle both short-term and long-term debt, as well as finance further growth.

The working environment and the employees Average number of employees (FTE) in the Group

<<<

 amounted to 6,459 in 2016. The working environment is considered to be good and efforts for improvements are made on an ongoing basis. The Group aims to be a workplace with equal op portunities and seeks to prevent gender discrimination in

<<<

 all aspects of our opera tions. Leave of absence is an important performance indicator and is measured throughout the Group's operational entities, but not on a consolidated basis. There has been no significant leave of absence in the parent

<<<

 company during 2016.
Environmental report The Group's operations are not harmful to the environment and are not regulated by any licenses related to waste handling.
Allocation of income in the parent company Norlandia Health & Care Group AS

Notes to the consolidated statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all

<<<

 the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by valuing financial derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
These

<<<

 financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB

<<<

) as adopted by the European Union ("adopted IFRSs").
Norlandia Health & Care Group AS was established in December 2016. This was done by transferring the shares in Norlandia Care Group AS, Hero Group AS, Aberia Healthcare AS and Kidsa Barnehager

<<<

 AS, from Hospitality Invest to a newly incorporated and 100% owned subsidiary.
The transfer to the newly incorporated subsidiary is considered to be a common control transaction outside the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. IFRS 3 Business

<<<

 Combinations does not provide specific guidance on how to account for common control transactions. Norlandia Health & Care Group has established policies to account for these transactions in order to present his torical figures as if the Group

<<<

 had prepared separate financial statements in the past. Book values have been used to account for all restructuring transactions as if the reorganisation occurred at the beginning of the first period presented. For more detail on the reorganisation

<<<

 see note 11.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgment in applying the Group's accounting policies

<<<

. The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 2.
Changes in accounting policies
a) New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from

<<<

 1 January 2016
· Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation - Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 · Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012 - 2014 cycle · Disclosure initiative - amendments to IAS 1.
The adoption of these amendments

<<<

 did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect future periods.
b) New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective
There are several new and amended standard issued by the IASB that

<<<

 are not yet effective. The most significant of these are as follows: · IFRS 9, 'Financial instruments' - 1 January 2018 · IFRS 15, 'Revenue recognistion' - 1 January 2018 · IFRS 16, 'Leases' - 1 January 2019
With the exception of IFRS 16 these

<<<

 standards and amendments are not expected to have material impact on the financial state ments. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
30 NORLANDIA

 HEALTH & CARE GROUP AS

More on IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 contains a single lessee accounting model, which eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases from the perspective of the lessee. All contracts that meet the definition

<<<

 of a lease, other than short term leases and leases of low value items for which a lessee has the option not to apply the measurement and presentation requirements of IFRS 16, will be recorded in the statement of financial position with a 

<<<

"right of use" asset and a corresponding liability. The asset is subsequently accounted for as property, plant and equipment or investment property and the liability is unwound using the interest rate inherent in the lease. IFRS 16 has an effective

<<<

 date of 1 January 2019, with early application permitted only if IFRS 15 has also been adopted.
The Group has significant leases commitment relating to current leases, detailed in note 18. At initial application the Group will have to recognize

<<<

 a significant lease liability and a significant right of use asset. The implementation is expected to have a nega tive impact on equity since the unwinding of the lease liability would not be linear. In the income statement lease payment cur

<<<

 rently presented in other operating expenses will be replaced by increased depriciations and increased intrest expenses, which would have a significant effect on earnings before interest, tax, deprication and amortization.
The Group has not

<<<

 yet completed the analysis of the impact of IFRS 16.
Applied principles
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and discounts. The Group recog nizes revenue from

<<<

 the sale of products or the rendering of services when the following conditions are met: · The amount of revenue and related costs can be measured reliably; · The significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to customers

<<<

 and there is no continuing management
involvement with the goods; and · The recovery of the consideration is probable.
Basis of consolidation Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating

<<<

 policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements pre sent the results of the company and its subsidiaries ("the Group") as if they formed

<<<

 a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the state

<<<

 ment of financial position, the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated

<<<

 statement of comprehen sive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
Non-controlling interests The Group initially recognise any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair

<<<

 value.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, the Group's interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, the total acquisition date fair value

<<<

 of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
The cost of a business combination comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-controlling

<<<

 interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree.
Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case

<<<

 of contingent consideration classi fied as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss. Direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any

<<<

 impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is

<<<

 credited in full to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on the acquisition date.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016 31

Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding inventories and deferred tax assets) Impairment tests on goodwill and other

<<<

 intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances in dicate that their carrying

<<<

 amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate

<<<

 the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest Group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows; its cash generating units ('CGUs'). Goodwill is allocated

<<<

 on initial recognition to each of the Group's CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in profit or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously

<<<

 recognised in other compre hensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Foreign currency Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in

<<<

 which they operate (their "functional currency") are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. The functional currency of the parent company and all subsidiaries is NOK. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated

<<<

 at the rates ruling at the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of

<<<

 monetary available for sale financial assets are treated as a separate component of the change in fair value and recognised in profit or loss. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary available for sale financial assets form part of the overall

<<<

 gain or loss recognised in respect of that financial instrument.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The Group has

<<<

 not designated any of its financial assets as hedging instruments or held to maturity.
The Group's accounting policy for each category of financial assets is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss This category comprises only in-the

<<<

-money derivatives (see "Financial liabilities" section for out-of-money derivatives). They are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive

<<<

 income in the finance income or expense line. The Group does not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and receivables These assets are non

<<<

-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types

<<<

 of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly at tributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate

<<<

 method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group

<<<

 will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired

<<<

 receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On

<<<

 confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
The Group's loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash

<<<

 equivalents in the consolidated state ment of financial position.
32 NORLANDIA HEALTH & CARE GROUP AS

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original

<<<

 maturities of three months or less, and - for the purpose of the statement of cash flows - bank overdrafts. Bank over drafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Financial

<<<

 liabilities The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which the liability was ac quired. None of the Group's financial liabilities are designated as hedging instruments.
Other than

<<<

 financial liabilities in a qualifying hedging relationship (see below), the Group's accounting policy for each category is as follows:
The Group's accounting policy for each category of financial liabilities is as follows:
Fair value through

<<<

 profit or loss This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives (see "Financial assets" for in the money derivatives). They are car ried in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised

<<<

 in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes, but for hedging purposes. Other than these derivative financial instruments, the Group does not have any

<<<

 liabilities held for trading nor has it designated any financial liabilities as being at fair value through profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities include the following items:
Borrowings are initially recognised

<<<

 at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any

<<<

 interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated statement of financial position. Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premia

<<<

 pay able on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised

<<<

 cost using the effective interest method.
IFRS 13 fair value measurement hierarchy IFRS 13 requires certain disclosures which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value using a fair value

<<<

 hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: · quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 

<<<

1); · inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2); and · inputs for the asset or liability that are

<<<

 not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)(Level 3).
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant

<<<

 to the fair value measurement. Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent

<<<

 that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability or financial asset.
The Group's ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Borrowing costs Interest incurred on bank loan used to fund the assets under construction with

<<<

 a construction period exceeding 12 months is be ing capitalised as part of its cost, net of interest received on cash drawn down yet to be expended. The Group does not incur any other interest costs that qualify for capitalisation.
ANNUAL REPORT

Retirement benefits: Defined contribution schemes Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year to which they relate.
Retirement benefits: Defined

<<<

 benefit schemes Defined benefit scheme surpluses and deficits are measured at:
"the fair value of plan assets at the reporting date; less plan liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method discounted to its present value using

<<<

 yields available on high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the liabilities; plus unrecognised past service cost
Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income as they arise

<<<

.
Past service costs are recognised directly in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time. In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight

<<<

 line basis over the vesting period.
Leased assets Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the Group (a "finance lease"), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased

<<<

 outright. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown

<<<

 as a liability. Lease payments are analysed between capital and inter est. The interest element is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period of the lease and is calculated so that it represents a constant

<<<

 proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group (an "operating lease"), the total rentals

<<<

 payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease

<<<

 term on a straight-line basis.
Externally acquired intangible assets Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
Intangible assets

<<<

 are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques (see section

<<<

 related to critical estimates and judgements below).
Internally generated intangible assets (development costs) Expenditure on internally developed products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that: · it is technically feasible to develop

<<<

 the product for it to be sold; · adequate resources are available to complete the development; · there is an intention to complete and sell the product; · the Group is able to sell the product; · sale of the product will generate future economic

<<<

 benefits; and · expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit from selling the products developed. The amortisation expense is included within

<<<

 the depreciation and amortisation expense line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are recog nised in the

<<<

 statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
34 NORLANDIA HEALTH & CARE GROUP AS

Deferred taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial

<<<

 position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: · the initial recognition of goodwill; · the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the trans

<<<


action affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and · investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing" of the reversal of the
difference and it is probable that the difference will

<<<

 not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.

The amount of the asset or

<<<

 liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the report ing date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities

<<<

 are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabili ties and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: · the same taxable group company

<<<

; or · different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or" to realise the assets
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred

<<<

 tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.

Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.

Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost

<<<

. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly attributable costs and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items. The cor responding liability is recognised within provisions.

Freehold

<<<

 land is not depreciated. Depreciation onassets under construction doesnot commence until theyare complete and

available for use. Depreciation is provided on allother items of property, plant and equipment so as to writeoff their carrying


<<<


value over their expected useful economic lives. Expected useful economic is as follows:

Land and buildings

10-40 years

Furniture, fixtures and equipment

3-30 years

Inventories Inventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently

<<<

 at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condi tion.

Weighted average cost is used to determine

<<<

 the cost of ordinarily interchangeable items.

Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale when: · they are available for immediate sale; · management is committed

<<<

 to a plan to sell; · it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn; · an active programme to locate a buyer has been initiated; · the asset or disposal group is being marketed at a reasonable

<<<

 price in relation to its fair value; and a sale is expected
to complete within 12 months from the date of classification.

Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of: · their carrying amount

<<<

 immediately prior to being classified as held for sale in accordance with the Group's accounting policy;
and fair value less costs to sell.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016 35

Following their classification as held for sale, non-current assets (including

<<<

 those in a disposal group) are not depreciated.
The results of operations disposed during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income up to the date of disposal.
A discontinued operation is a component of the

<<<

 Group's business that represents a separate major line of business or geographi cal area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been aban doned or that meets the criteria

<<<

 to be classified as held for sale.
Discontinued operations are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a single line which comprises the post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation along with the post-tax

<<<

 gain or loss recognised on the re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on disposal of the assets or disposal groups constituting discontinued operations.
Government grants Grants for revenue expenditure are presented as income the

<<<

 Group. Where retention of a government grant is dependent on the Group satisfying certain criteria, it is initially recognised as deferred income. When the criteria for retention have been satisfied, the deferred income balance is released

<<<

 to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Provisions The Group has recognised provisions for liabilities of uncertain timing or amount including those for onerous leases, warranty claims, leasehold dilapidations and legal disputes

<<<

. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, discounted at a pre-tax rate, reflecting current market assessments at the time of the remaining lease term, value of

<<<

 money and risks specific to the liability. In the case of leasehold dilapidations, the provision takes into account the potential that the properties in question may be sublet for some or all of the remaining lease term.
Cash flow statement

<<<

 The cash flow statement is derived using the indirect method.
Cash flows from investing and financing activities are presented separatly. Operating activities comprise both monetary and non-monetary items. Interest income and interest expenses

<<<

 are presented as part of operating activities with the exception of interest paid and received which is separated and presented as financial activities.
Cash and cash eqvivalents comprise of bank deposits.
2. CR ITICA L A CCO U N TIN G ESTIM

<<<

 ATES AN D JU D G EM EN TS
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that

<<<

 are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying

<<<

 amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Judgements and estimates
(a) Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable

<<<

 amount is de termined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. More information including

<<<

 carrying values is included in note 10. Any significant modification of market conditions could translate into an inability to recover the carrying amounts of non-financial assets; and resolt in an impairment charge in the income statement

<<<


(b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Measurement of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives requires estimates for determining the asset's expected useful lives and residual

<<<

 values. Management judgement is required to determine the components and the depreciation.
36 NORLANDIA HEALTH & CARE GROUP AS

(c) Income taxes The Group is subject to income tax in only one jurisdiction. Significant judgement is required

<<<

 in determining the provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determi nation is uncertain. As a result, the Group recognises tax liabilities based on

<<<

 estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognised when, despite the Group's belief that its tax return positions are supportable, the Group believes that certain positions are likely to be

<<<

 challenged and may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authori ties. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and

<<<

 interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgements about future events. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded

<<<

, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are recognized when it is considered probable that deductible temporary differences will be recovered in the foreseeable

<<<

 future. To the extent that future taxable income and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction differ significantly from the Group's estimate, the ability of the Group to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted.
Such

<<<

 judgements and estimates are based on the facts and information available to the management of the Group. Changes in facts and circumstances may require the revision of previous estimates, and actual results could differ from these estimates

<<<

.
3. FIN A N CIA L IN STRU M EN TS - RISK M AN AG EM ENT
The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks: · Credit risk · Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk · Foreign exchange risk · Other market price risk

<<<

 · Liquidity risk
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note de scribes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods

General objectives, policies and processes The Board has overall responsibility

<<<

 for the determination of the Group's risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation

<<<

 of the objectives and policies to the Group's finance function. The Board receives monthly reports from the Group Financial Controller through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriate ness of the

<<<

 objectives and policies it sets.

The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group's competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies

<<<

 are set out below:

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit

<<<

 sales. It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts. Such credit ratings are taken into account by local business practices.

Most of the Group's revenues are from (public) authorities

<<<

. Credit risk related to these customers are minimal.

Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum

<<<

 rating "A" are accepted.

Further disclosures regarding trade and other receivables, which are neither past due nor impaired, are provided in note 13.

38 NORLANDIA HEALTH & CARE GROUP AS

Market risk Market risk arises from the Group's use

<<<

 of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), foreign exchange rates

<<<

 (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).

Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from long-term borrowings at variable rate. The Group has currently no Group policy

<<<

 restricting the level of interest risk exposure. The level of interest risk is monitored centrally. Local operations are not permitted to borrow long-term from external sources. Although the board accepts that this policy neither protects the

<<<

 Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks

<<<

.

During 2016 and 2015, the Group's borrowings at variable interest rate were denominated in NOK and SEK.

Based on the various scenarios the Group has the possibility to manage its cash-flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest

<<<

 rate swaps (quantitative disclosures are given in note 12). The Group has not pursued an active strategy in order to mitigate any interest rate risk. Normally the Group has raised long-term borrowings at floating rates and only to a minor extent

<<<

 swapped them into fixed.

The ratio of floating interest bearing debt and interest rate swaps was as follows:

Sensitivity

A change in the interest rate curve will result in a changed interest cost for the net exposure, in addition the change in fair value

for the interest rate swaps will have a

Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations in Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands. Currency fluctuations may have a negative effect on the Group's financial conditions and results of operations

<<<

. The Group is predominantly exposed to the SEK/NOK exchange rate as the financial statements are presented in NOK and around 40% of revenues are generated in SEK. However, the Group has a corresponding share of costs in SEK and about 58% of

<<<

 its bond debt is denominated in SEK, both representing natural hedges to the operations. The Group has a small but growing exposure to the EURNOK exchange rate as operations in the Netherlands and Finland are growing. The Group is monitoring

<<<

 the exposure and will consider hedging this exposure in the future.

Other market price risk There are no other significant marked risk exposure on financial instruments.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Group's management of

<<<

 working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.

The Group's policy is to ensure that it

<<<

 will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected requirements for a period of at least 45 days. The Group

<<<

 also seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates (and hence cash flows) on a portion of its long term borrowings, this is further discussed in the 'interest rate risk' section above.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016 39

The Board receives rolling

<<<

 12-month cash flow projections on a monthly basis as well as information regarding cash balances. At the end of the financial year, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations

<<<

 under all reasonably expected circumstances.

The liquidity risk of each Group entity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function. A major focus for the treasury function is to ensure that there are sufficient liquidity for downpayment

<<<

 on non current borrowings when they are due. In 2015 non-current borrowings were restructured. Shareholder loan was settled and future payment plan on borrowings was adjusted. The Group treasury assesses the terms for borrowings on a ongoing

<<<

 basis, when needed the necessary adjustments are put into place.

Capital Disclosures The Group monitors "adjusted capital" which comprises

<<<

 all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, non-controlling interest, retained earnings, and revaluation reserve) other than amounts in the cash flow hedging reserve.

The Group's objectives when maintaining capital are: "to

<<<

 safeguard the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services

<<<

 commensurately with the level of risk."

The Group sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk

<<<

 characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt

<<<

.

Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the debt to adjusted capital ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt adjusted capital as defined above. Net debt is calculated as total debt (as shown

<<<

 in the consolidated state ment of financial position) less cash and cash equivalents.

Due to recent market uncertainty, the Group's strategy is to preserve a strong cash base and achieve a equity to total capital ra

tio of approximately 

<<<

15-25%. The objective of this strategy is to secure access to finance at reasonable cost by maintaining a high

credit rating. The debt-to-total-capital ratios at 31 December 2016 and at 31 December 2015 were as follows:

Independent Auditor's Report
To the General Meeting of Norlandia Health 8t Care Group AS
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion We have audited the financial statements of Norlandia

<<<

 Health 6t Care Group AS. The financial statements comprise:

 in equity, cash flow for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion:
· The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the law and regulations

<<<

Key Audit Matters_______________________________________________________________
Key audit matters

<<<

 are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole

<<<

, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Description of key audit matter

How the key audit matter was addressed in the audit

Valuation of intangibles

The Group's book value of intangibles

<<<

 in the financial statements amounts to NOK 2 121 420 581, equivalent to 50,04 % of the
group's total assets. The value of the intangibles has been subject to impairment testing, which is described in note 10 to
the financial statements. The

<<<

 am ount, the complexity and the judgement involved in the valuation, has led us to identify this as a risk area in our audit.

Our audit procedures included, among others, involving our internal valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating

<<<

 the assumptions and methodologies used in the
impairment test, in particular those relating to the discounted cash flow model and wacc calculations. We also focused on
the adequacy of the Group's disclosures about those assumptions to which

<<<

 the outcome of the impairment tests is most sensitive, that is, those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the value of the intangibles. We have also evaluated the management's competence
and independence in performing

<<<

 the impairment tests.

Bond

Norlandia Health & Care Group AS was established in December 2016 by Hospitality Invest AS by transferring 4 subsidiaries to a newly incorporated 100% owned subsidiary. The restructuring involved business combinations

<<<

 under common control outside the scope of IFRS 3. The group has establish policies to account for these transactions in order to present historical figures as if the group prepared separate financial statements in the past (for details on the

<<<

 restructuring see note 1 and note 11). The complexity and judgment involved in the accounting of the restructuring, led us to identify this as a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures included assessing the appropriateness of policies applied

<<<

 on the restructuring, reviewing the historical figures presented, and reconciling them with the audited figures included in the 2015 consolidated financial statement of Hospitality Invest for 2015. We also assessed the adequacy of the Group

<<<

's disclosures regarding the restructuring.

Other information Independent Auditor's Report 2016 Norlandia Health & Care Group AS - Page 2 of 5

IBDO
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Board

<<<

 of Directors' report, statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information

<<<

 and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially

<<<

 inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information

<<<

, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management)

<<<

 are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements of the parent company in accordance with Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the preparation

<<<

 and fair presentation of the financial statements of the group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation

<<<

 of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern

<<<

, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements of the parent company use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The financial statements

<<<

 of the group use the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

<<<

 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance

<<<

 is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement

<<<

 when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements

<<<

IB P O
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International

<<<

 Standards on Auditing (ISAs), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or

<<<

 error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud

<<<

 is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order

<<<

 to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the

<<<

 reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material

<<<

 uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor

<<<

's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future

<<<

 events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent

<<<

 the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion

<<<

 on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among

<<<

 other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit
We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that

<<<

 we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all

relationships and other matters that may reasonably

<<<

 be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements

<<<

 of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that

<<<

 a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Opinion

<<<

 on the Board of Directors' report Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors' report and statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social

Opinion on Registration

 and Documentation__________________________________________ Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements

 (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the company
