Summons for Written Resolution - Support for Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders' Restructuring Proposal
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (together, the "Bondholders") in the abovementioned bond issue

<<<

 (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue"), a bond loan of USD 939,100,570 issued by Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. (collectively with Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro S.A.P.I. de C.V. and its respective subsidiaries and affiliates, the

"Company").
Capitalized terms used herein (including any attachment hereto) shall have the meaning assigned to them in the amended and restated bond agreement dated 24 January 2014 (as amended from time to time, the "Bond Agreement"), unless

 otherwise defined herein.
This summons for a written resolution (the "Summons") is hereby issued at the request of an ad hoc group of Bondholders (the "Ad Hoc Group") that represents that its members hold, as of August 30, 2017, approximately

1 BACKGROUND

<<<


1.1 Introduction
On 11 August 2017, the Company issued a press release disclosing the request by Petroleos Mexicanos ("Pemex") for a series of amendments to the drilling contracts between the Company and Pemex for the Primus, Laurus, Fortius

<<<

, Decus, and Impetus rigs (collectively, the "Pemex Proposal"). In response, the Ad Hoc Group sent a letter to the Company, dated 11 August 2017, informing the Company of the Ad Hoc Group's support for the Pemex Proposal. The Ad Hoc Group's

<<<

 letter included as an exhibit a proposed term sheet (the "Term Sheet") setting forth a proposal that the Ad Hoc Group believes will allow the Company to implement the Pemex Proposal while maintaining the uninterrupted operational performance

<<<

 of the affected drilling rigs for the benefit of the Company and for all its stakeholders. A copy of the 11 August 2017 letter and Term Sheet is attached hereto as Exhibit A .

On 28 August 2017, the Company announced its own proposal for

<<<

 a comprehensive restructuring of the Bonds (the "Company Proposal"). As the Company explained in its announcement, the Company proposal is designed to "exchange [the Bonds] for a package of new securities, including new senior notes, new preferred

<<<

 equity, new common equity, cash and the Primus rig." In response to the Company Proposal, the Ad Hoc Group sent another letter to the Company, dated 28 August 2017, reiterating the Ad Hoc Group's support for the Pemex Proposal and rejecting

<<<

 the Company Proposal. The Ad Hoc Group stated in its 28 August 2017 letter that "there is no justification for the [Bondholders] to undertake a material debt for equity conversion given the Company's current financial and operational condition

<<<

, including the Ad Hoc Group's support for the [Pemex Proposal]." Indeed, the Ad Hoc Group is not willing at this time to support any transaction that results in a debt-for-equity exchange.
In addition, the Ad Hoc Group does not believe the

<<<

 Company's proposal to transfer the Primus to the Bondholders is in the best interests of the Company or its stakeholders. The Ad Hoc Group maintains that the current size of the Company's fleet provides significant operational benefits through

<<<

 increased efficiencies and economies of scale, and supports the Company's competitive position within the industry. Accordingly, the Ad Hoc Group is not willing at this time to support any transaction that breaks up the Company's fleet.
In

<<<

 an effort to expedite discussions with the Company, and to provide certainty to the Company's stakeholders, the Ad Hoc Group requests the issuance of this Summons for a written resolution of the Bondholders approving the restructuring proposal

<<<

 set forth below in Section 2 of this Summons (the "Ad Hoc Group Proposal"). The Ad Hoc Group Proposal is substantially similar to the proposal set forth in the Term Sheet included in the Ad Hoc Group's 11 August 2017 letter, except that the

<<<

 Ad Hoc Group Proposal now includes an amendment to allow the Company to establish an all-cash management incentive plan on terms to be agreed by the Company and Bondholders holding at least 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount

<<<

 of the Bonds (the "Majority Bondholders").
2 AD HOC GROUP PROPOSAL
The Ad Hoc Group has approached the Bond Trustee to issue the Summons to consider the Ad Hoc Group Proposal to amend the Bond Agreement to, among other things, (1) allow the

<<<

 Company to implement the Pemex Proposal, (2) permit the Company to establish an all-cash management incentive program on terms to be agreed by the Company and the Majority Bondholders, (3) amend the Bond Agreement's application o f proceeds

<<<

 waterfall set forth in Clause 13.4 o f the Bond Agreement to provide for a cash sweep o f excess cash into the Issuer Debt Service Account; and (4) revise the Annual Budget to require more reporting detail and make such budget subject to the
