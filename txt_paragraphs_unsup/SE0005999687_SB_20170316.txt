5 (9)

4.4 Bonds registered with a nominee

If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different

<<<

 options to influence the voting for the Bonds.

1.

You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the

Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.

2.

You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule

<<<

 2) from the authorised nominee

or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the

authorization. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need

to obtain authorization directly from the intermediary that

<<<

 is registered in the

debt register as bondholder of the Securities Account, or from each

intermediary in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary that is

registered in the debt register as a Bondholder of the Securities Account

<<<

 as

authorised nominee or direct registered owner.

Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the

<<<

 agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).

The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not

<<<

 know how your Bonds are registered or need authorization or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights.

4.5 Quorum

To approve the Amendments, Bondholders

<<<

 representing at least fifty (50) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.

If a quorum does not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant

<<<

 proposal has not been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure.

4.6 Majority

In order for the Amendments to be approved, at least two thirds (2/3) of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which

<<<

 Bondholders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to the Amendments.

4.7 Address for sending replies

Return the Voting Form in Schedule 1, and, if applicable, the Power of Attorney/Authorisation in Schedule 2 or other sufficient

<<<

 evidence, if the Bonds are held in custody other than Euroclear Sweden, by regular mail, scanned copy by e-mail, or by courier to:
