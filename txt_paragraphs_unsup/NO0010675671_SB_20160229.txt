Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Extension of certain deadlines under the Bond Agreement

1.

INTRODUCTION

Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders

<<<

") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") by Sterling Resources (UK) Ltd. (previously Sterling Resources (UK) pic) ("Sterling" or the "Issuer"), and guaranteed by Sterling Resources Ltd. (the "Parent" and together

<<<

 with its subsidiaries, the "Group").

Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally entered into on 2 May 2013 as amended and restated on 12 December 2014 and

<<<

 as further amended and restated on 22 May 2015 and on 30 November 2015 (as amended and restated from time to time, the "Bond Agreement") and as further amended by the amendment letters dated 29 January 2016, 16 February, 22 February 2016 and

<<<

 29 February 2016 (the "Amendment Letter(s)").

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and the described proposal set out in Section 3 (Proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement) below is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee

<<<

 expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons letter in its entirety.

2.

BACKGROUND

In accordance with the approval of the Bondholders at a Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

 held on 6 November 2015, various amendments and waivers were made to the terms and conditions governing the Bonds, including deferral of the 30 October 2015 Instalment, suspension of payments to the DSRA account, appointment of an independent

<<<

 director to the Issuer's board of directors (and an observer to the board of directors of the Parent) and introduction o f a set of refinancing milestones intended to achieve a redemption of the Bonds as soon as practically possible and in

<<<

 any event on or before 29 February 2016 that would result in the repayment in cash in full of all of the obligations and liabilities owed to the Bond Trustee and/or the Bondholders under or pursuant to the Finance Documents ("the Bond Redemption

<<<

").

The Group's efforts with respect to achieving a strategic transaction or refinancing resulting in a full Bond Redemption have not been successful. However, discussions between the Parent, the Issuer , the Bond Trustee and a group of large

<<<

 Bondholders holding in aggregate more than 2/3 of the Bonds (the "Bondholder Committee") are continuing about a recapitalization of the Group (the "Recapitalisation"). The Bond Trustee has inter alia pursuant to the Amendment Letters granted

<<<

 temporary waivers to the Issuer against the Issuer and the Parent providing certain additional undertakings, the breach of which would constitute an Event of Default under the Bond Agreement while these discussions regarding a Recapitalisation

<<<

 continue. Subject to completion of these discussions and negotiation of associated legal documentation, the Company expects within the next two

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

2/6
weeks to ask the
