 Blom ASA Senior Secured Bond Issue 2009/2012
Oslo, 8 March 2011
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL (THE "SUMMONS")
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bond issue with ISIN NO 001 05

<<<

3847.3 (the "Bond Issue") with Blom ASA as issuer (the "Issuer").
All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the agreement for the Bond Issue (the "Bond Agreement") unless otherwise

<<<

 stated.
The information regarding the operational and financial status o f the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 BACKGROUND

<<<

 AND CORPORATE UPDATE The Issuer was as of 31 December 2010 in breach of covenants relating to equity ratio and the ratio between interest bearing debt and EBITDA in the Bond Agreement. The breach of the covenants came after a period of disappointing

<<<

 operating results, and significant write-downs and loss of income following a dispute with Pictometry. The board of directors believes that the breach of the covenants is not only a temporary problem, but that it is necessary to restructure

<<<

 the Issuer's capital structure to establish a sound financial basis for continued operations.
As previously announced, the Issuer has been in dialogue with the Bond Trustee and certain of its bondholders. The Issuer, together with its financial

<<<

 advisors, has developed and proposed a restructuring plan to create a new financial platform (the "Restructuring") for the Issuer. The Restructuring includes, amongst other things, a proposal for a new debt repayment schedule, a strengthening

<<<

 of the Issuer's balance sheet through an issue of new equity, and an issue of additional debt to cover short term liquidity needs. The objective of the Restructuring is to secure a viable financial platform going forward and a debt amortization

<<<

 schedule that fits the current operating cash flow and market conditions.

3 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL 3.1 The Issuer's evaluation The Issuer has previously evaluated

<<<

 various alternatives for a financial restructuring to meet its debt commitments and safeguard values for lenders. The current cash generation is not sufficient to meet the current debt amortization schedule and available liquidity is limited

<<<

.

4

Consequently, a restructuring o f the current amortization plan is required. The main objective with the proposed Restructuring is to safeguard values and secure a viable financial platform for the Issuer. Although the Issuer acknowledges

<<<

 that significant concessions are required from all stakeholders, the Restructuring represents in the Issuer's view a balanced proposal which will benefit all stakeholders.
Furthermore, the Issuer and its financial advisor are o f the opinion

<<<

 that the proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement are required to facilitate the Equity Issue, which will be to the benefit o f the Bondholders.
Correspondingly, the Issuer is o f the opinion that the Restructuring is to the advantage of the

<<<

 Bondholders, and that the Restructuring is fully aligned w ith the interests of the Bondholders.
3.2 The Bond Trustee's evaluation The Bond Advisor has been mandated by the Bond Trustee in accordance with the preceding discussions with the

<<<

 Issuer leading to this Summons. For further discussions with the Bond Advisor, please contact SEB Enskilda AS, att. Karl Skjelbred +47 21 00 85 78, karl. skielbred@enskilda.no.
The Bond Trustee puts forward the proposal set out herein without

<<<

 any further evaluations or recommendation from the Bond Trustee.
The Bondholders must independently evaluate, based on available information, whether the Restructuring is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from

<<<

 tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences o f the Restructuring.
No due diligence investigations have been carried out by the Bond Advisor with respect to the Issuer and the Bond Advisor expressly disclaim any and

<<<

 all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal (Including but not limited to the information contained herein!.
