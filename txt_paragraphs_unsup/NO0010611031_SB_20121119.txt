Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Proposal for Extension of Interest Payment Date

1.

INTRODUCTION

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the

<<<

 "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bond issue "13.5 per cent Jasper Explorer PLC Senior Secured Bond Issue 2011/2016" with ISIN NO 001 0611031 (the "Bonds") where Jasper Explorer PLC (the "Company") is

<<<

 the issuer.

All capitalised terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Bonds (the "Bond Agreement") between the Company and the Bond Trustee dated 26 May 2011.

The information

<<<

 in this Summons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status o f the Company is provided by the Company, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read

<<<

 this Summons in its entirety.

2.

BACKGROUND

As reported in the Company's quarterly financial report for the financial period ended 30 June 2012 published on the Company's website www.idoshore.com. the Drillship has been undergoing repairs

<<<

 and maintenance in Spain. The extent and period of repairs have exceeded the Company's initial projections and resulted in delay in getting the Drillship on contract. The Charterer (as defined in the Bond Agreement) is in contract negotiations

<<<

 with an international oil company to utilise the Drillship. The anticipated operational commencement o f the contract is in the 4th quarter of the financial year 2012 (period ending 31 March 2013), and the schedule for completion of remaining

<<<

 repairs to the Drillship and other preparatory activities for operations is in line with this time frame.
The Company's priority at this time is to secure work for the Drillship and complete repairs in a timely manner. The capital expenditure

<<<

, operating expenditure and financing costs incurred in repairing the Drillship have, however, exceeded the Company's original estimates. Also, as the Drillship has not registered any revenue since it came off-hire in March 2012, this has materially

<<<

 impacted the Company's cash flow. The Company has relied on its Parent and Jasper Investments Limited to provide funds to enable it to meet interest payments and comply with other covenants in the Bond Agreement as well as finance the ongoing

<<<

 repairs and maintenance work on the Drillship. However, in order to be able to complete the ongoing

repairs and prepare the Drillship for going on contract, there is now a clear need to conserve available cash.
In that context, the Company believes that a deferment of the interest payment due on 27 November 2012 in the

<<<

 sum US$11,137,500 (the "Interest Sum") would be beneficial for all stakeholders in view of the Company's current financial situation. The Company therefore seeks an extension of the due date of the Interest Sum from 27 November 2012 to 27 March

<<<

 2013 and waiver of payment of the Interest Sum until 27 March 2013 (the "Extension"), with the other terms o f the Bond Agreement remaining unchanged.

3.

PROPOSAL

Based on the foregoing, the Company hereby asks the Bondholders' meeting to

<<<

 approve the following proposal (the "Proposal"):

(a) That the due date o f the Interest Sum shall be extended from 27 November 2012 to 27 March 2013 such that the Interest Sum will fall due and be payable on 27 March 2013.

(b) If (a) above

<<<

 is approved, the Bondholders also waive any rights o f the Bondholders or the Trustee under Clause 15 of the Bond Agreement in relation to the failure by the Company to pay the Interest Sum on 27 November 2012 and within any applicable grace

<<<

 period.

(c) If (a) above is not approved and Bondholders do not otherwise approve extension of the payment date of the Interest Sum, the Company shall pay the Interest Sum together with late payment interest thereon in accordance with the

<<<

 Bond Agreement no later than 5 Business Days after the date of the meeting. Provided such payment is duly made by the Company, the Bondholders also waive any rights of the Bondholders or the Trustee under Clause 15 of the Bond Agreement in

<<<

 relation to the failure by the Company to pay the Interest Sum on 27 November 2012 and within any applicable grace period.

For the avoidance of doubt the Company shall still be required to pay to the Bondholders in full all other amounts payable

<<<

 under the Bond Agreement when due and which have not been waived.

4.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

The Com pany's evaluation:

The Company believes that the Proposal is the best interim solution for all stakeholders including the Bondholders

<<<

 in view of the Company's current financial situation and as the initial step towards restructuring discussions on the Company's financial obligations towards the Bondholders.

Non-reliance of the Trustee:

The Proposal is put forward to the

<<<

 Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal and financial

<<<
