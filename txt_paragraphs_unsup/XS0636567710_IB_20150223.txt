Press release
Oslo, 23 February 2015

Refinancing successfully completed
Norske Skog has completed the refinancing of a portion of its bond maturities through the issuance of EUR 290 million senior secured notes (SSN) and the exchange of existing

<<<

 bonds into new bonds with longer maturities.
- We are very pleased that our refinancing plan announced in January now has been successfully completed. Following these transactions, we have significantly improved our capital structure through

<<<

 enhanced liquidity, immediate de-leveraging and an extended maturity profile, said Mr. Sven Ombudstvedt, President and CEO of Norske Skog.
Norske Skog has extended the maturities on a significant portion of its indebtedness, with new notes

<<<

 maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2023. The new EUR 290 million SSN mature in December 2019 and will be structurally senior to all remaining existing notes and notes issued in the exchange offer. The exchange notes will be structurally junior to the

<<<

 SSN, but structurally senior to remaining existing notes and mature in 2021 and 2023. The remaining existing notes will be structurally junior to the SSN and exchange notes. For further information on the exchange offers outcome, please see

<<<

 the separate announcement related to the Exchanges Offers and Consent Solicitations released today.
More than 75% of the existing bond holders consented to the transactions, and approximately 45% of the existing bonds participated in the exchange

<<<

 offer. Immediate deleveraging of around NOK 500 million was realized in the refinancing. This leads to a significant improvement in the group's total liquidity, despite a short-term increase in the cost of borrowings. The final settlement of

<<<

 the transactions is scheduled for 24 February 2015.
- With the refinancing completed, we can shift full focus to business operations. In Europe, we now have very competitive assets with the weaker NOK, while our export business, benefit from

<<<

 the stronger USD. As always, cost and capital efficiency remain a top priority, said Mr. Ombudstvedt.
The advisors for the transactions are Goldman Sachs International and Citi. This information is subject of the disclosure requirements pursuant

<<<

 to section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
