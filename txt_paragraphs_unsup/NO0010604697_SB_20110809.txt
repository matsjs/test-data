 and Putable Bond Issue 2011/2016

Oslo, 26 July 2011

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Waiver of certain rights

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as loan trustee for the abovementioned bond loans - all of which are documented in an amended

<<<

 and restated loan agreement dated 10 March 2011 (as amended, amended and restated and supplemented, the "Loan Agreement").

Capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the

<<<

 Loan Agreement.

When used herein "Tranche" shall mean each of or any of (as the context requires) the Tranche A Loan, the Tranche B Loan, the Tranche Cl Loan and the Tranche C2 Loan

The information in this summons regarding the Borrowers

<<<

 and market conditions are provided by the Borrowers, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1

Background

In connection with the recent financial restructuring of the Group, certain

<<<

 cross-defaults under the Loan Agreement were waived for the duration of the Parent Borrower's standstill agreement with Export Development Canada ("EDC"). That standstill agreement has now terminated, and the resulting potential Defaults and

<<<

 Events of Default under the Loan Agreement may create obstacles for the Group in relation to further financings, new business opportunities and its continuing efforts to arrange completion of the vessels under construction at Davie Yards in

<<<

 Canada. As a consequence, the Borrowers are requesting that the Bondholders grant a further waiver of certain Defaults and Events of Default arising in connection with the EDC Loan Agreement. The Borrowers believe such a waiver is in the best

<<<

 interests of the Group, the Bondholders and its other stakeholders.

amendment, waiver or modification of, any of the terms of the Loan Agreement or the other Finance Documents.
