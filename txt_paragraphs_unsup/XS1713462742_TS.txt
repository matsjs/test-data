IMPORTANT NOTICE

RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING AND SALES TO RETAIL

<<<

 INVESTORS

The Notes are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors. In some jurisdictions (including the United Kingdom), regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws, regulations

<<<

 or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the Notes to retail investors.

In particular, in June 2015, the FCA published the Product Intervention (Contingent Convertible Instruments and Mutual Society Shares) Instrument

<<<

 2015, which took effect from 1st October, 2015 (the PI Instrument).

In addition, (i) on 1st January, 2018, the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged and retail and insurance-based investment

<<<

 products (as amended, the PRIIPs Regulation) became directly applicable in all EEA member states and (ii) MiFID II was required to be implemented in EEA member states by 3rd January, 2018. Together, the PI Instrument, the PRIIPs Regulation

<<<

 and MiFID II are referred to as the Regulations.

The Regulations set out various obligations in relation to (i) the manufacturing and distribution of financial instruments and (ii) the offering, sale and distribution of packaged retail and

<<<

 insurance-based investment products and certain contingent write down or convertible securities, such as the Notes.

Potential investors should inform themselves of, and comply with, any applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance with

<<<

 respect to any resale of the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein), including the Regulations.

The Issuer and each of the Joint Lead Managers are required to comply with some or all of the Regulations. By purchasing, or making or accepting

<<<

 an offer to purchase, any Notes (or a beneficial interest in such Notes) from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers, each prospective investor will thereby represent, warrant, agree with and undertake to the Issuer and each of the Joint

<<<

 Lead Managers that:

(i)

it is not a retail client as defined in MiFID II;

(ii) whether or not it is subject to the Regulations, it will not:

(A) sell or offer the Notes (or any beneficial interest therein) to retail clients (as defined

<<<

 in MiFID II); or

(B) communicate (including the distribution of this document) or approve an invitation or inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) where that invitation or inducement

<<<

 is addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by, a retail client (as defined in MiFID II). In selling or offering Notes or making or approving communications relating to the Notes, it may not rely on the limited

<<<

 exemptions set out in the PI Instrument; and

(iii) it will at all times comply with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside the EEA) relating to the promotion, offering, distribution and/or sale

<<<

 of the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein), including (without limitation) MiFID II and any other applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance relating to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in

<<<

 the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) by investors in any relevant jurisdiction.

Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed client when purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes (or any

<<<

 beneficial interests therein) from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers the foregoing representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings will be given by and be binding upon both the agent and its underlying client(s).

Prohibition

<<<

 of sales to EEA retail investors - The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail investor in the EEA. For

5

these purposes, a retail

<<<

 investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the Insurance Mediation Directive), where

<<<

 that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive. Consequently, no key information document required by the

<<<

 PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in

<<<

 the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. Professional investors and ECPs only target market - Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect o f the Notes has led

<<<

 to the conclusions that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution o f the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional

<<<

 clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a distributor) should take into consideration the manufacturer's target market assessment. However, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible

<<<

 for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

RISK FACTORS
The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. All o f these factors are contingencies that may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in

<<<

 a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring.
In addition, factors which the Issuer believes may be material fo r the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are also described below

<<<

.
The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the inability o f the Issuer to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes may occur

<<<

 for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it or which it may not currently be able to anticipate. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information

<<<

 set out elsewhere in this Prospectus and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
The following is a general discussion o f certain risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes

<<<

. In particular, it does not consider an investor's specific knowledge and/or understanding about risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes, whether obtained through experience, training or otherwise

<<<

, or the lack o f such specific knowledge and/or understanding, or circumstances that may apply to a particular investor.
Words and expressions defined in the "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes " below or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the

<<<

 same meanings in this section, unless otherwise stated. References to a numbered "Condition " shall be to the relevant Condition in the Terms and Conditions o f the Notes.
Factors that may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations

<<<

 under the Notes
The Issuer is regulated by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (the DFSA) which ensures a regulatory environment comparable to the regulatory environments of other Western European banks.
In connection with carrying out

<<<

 its business activities the Issuer is exposed to a variety of risks. The Issuer considers risk management as one of its core competencies and essential for prudent bank management. Risk management includes identifying and measuring risk as

<<<

 well as monitoring and reporting risk.
The Issuer is subject to Credit, Market, Liquidity, Operational and Reputation Risk which, if realised, may have an adverse impact on its results.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that an exposure is

<<<

 deemed non-recoverable due to a debtor's lack of will or ability to repay at the agreed time. Exposures comprise loans and advances, guarantees and amounts owed by credit institutions.
Overall credit risk is managed according to policies and

<<<

 limits as determined and adopted by the Bank's Board of Directors and Executive Management. The credit department is responsible for monitoring credit risk, credit risk exposure and reporting to the Bank's Board of Directors and Executive Management

<<<

.
To manage credit risks to retail and corporate clients the Group has developed rating models.
If the creditworthiness of a client is questioned and his ability to pay is deemed uncertain, the exposure will be classified as critical and the

<<<

 monitoring will be intensified.
In addition to individual impairment charges, the Bank adjusts total impairment charges annually on the basis of statistical calculations of the expected risk of loss. Individual impairment charges are made if

<<<

 an exposure is deemed to entail a risk of loss due to a customer's expected financial situation compared with the realisation value of security provided.
14

Trading in securities, currencies and derivatives, as well as payment services, involves

<<<

 exposure to financial counterparties in the form of delivery risk or credit risk. Delivery risk lines and credit risk lines to financial counterparties are based on the risk profile of the individual counterparty which is assessed in terms

<<<

 of rating, earnings, capital position and the size of the financial counterparty. Risks and lines to financial counterparties are monitored continuously.
The Issuer participates in an international foreign exchange settlement system, CLS, which

<<<

 aims to reduce delivery risk. In CLS, payment is made on the net position for each currency, and only one amount for each currency is paid or received. In addition this net exposure is only to one counterparty, who is the Issuer's partner in

<<<

 the system.
The Issuer aims to mitigate credit risk to financial counterparties in many ways, for example by concluding netting agreements (ISDA agreements). Moreover, to ensure credit risk mitigation of derivatives, the Issuer has entered

<<<

 into credit support annex agreements (CSA agreements) with all significant counterparties. Exposures are calculated on a daily basis after which the parties settle collateral.
The Group aims to ensure a credit portfolio in conformity with sector

<<<

 averages, in terms of retail/ corporate distribution and industry distribution.
The Bank is continuously working to further develop the classification and rating models that are applied to evaluate and classify existing as well as new retail

<<<

 and corporate exposures.
Model development is based on the recommendations as regards design and application of internal credit risk models which have been submitted by the Basel Committee.
Notwithstanding the systems the Bank has put in place

<<<

, there can be no assurance that the Bank will not suffer losses from credit risk in the future that may be material in amount.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the market value of the Group's assets and liabilities will be affected

<<<

 as a result of changes in market conditions, such as interest rate fluctuations in the financial markets, exchange rate fluctuations or equity price fluctuations, of which interest rate risk is the most prominent.
Market risk management is

<<<

 the responsibility of Sydbank Markets and Treasury, subject to the policies and limits determined and adopted by the Bank's Board of Directors. Market risk associated with trading and customer portfolios is managed by Sydbank Markets and the

<<<

 Bank's Controllers and Risk Management continuously monitor the individual risk areas and provide the Bank's General Management with extensive reporting on a regular basis.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises the Group's total risk

<<<

 of loss resulting from interest rate changes in the financial markets. Interest rate risk makes up the bulk of the Group's overall market risk.
The Group uses a cash flow model to determine the interest rate risk of fixed-rate positions. A

<<<

 duration model is used to calculate the interest rate risk of Danish callable mortgage bonds.
The interest rate risk is calculated in accordance with the method of calculation of the DFSA. The method allows full set-off between different currencies

<<<

, maturities and yield curves. The Group is aware of the risk of these assumptions and monitors these risks separately on an ongoing basis. However, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will not suffer losses from interest rate risk in

<<<

 the future that may be material in amount.
15

Foreign exchange risk
The Issuer does not assume major risk in the foreign exchange market for its own account and the Group's foreign exchange risk is therefore insignificant. However, there

<<<

 can be no assurance that the Issuer will not suffer losses from foreign exchange risk in the future that may be material in amount.
Equity risk
The Group invests some of its assets in shares, which are generally subject to greater risk and

<<<

 volatility than bonds. The amounts invested in listed shares are relatively small. However, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will not suffer losses from equity risk in the future that may be material in amount.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity

<<<

 risk comprises the risk that payment obligations cannot be honoured by means of the Group's cash resources or that the Bank's liquidity situation does not meet the statutory requirements.
Sydbank aims to maintain a balanced relationship between

<<<

 growth in its loan book and growth in deposits and a strong deposit base has always been the main funding source. The deposit base is primarily based on Danish funding and is therefore dependent on the overall economic development in Denmark

<<<

. The short term funding is based on both Danish and foreign funding while the long term funding primarily is based on foreign investors. Based on this, Sydbank is to some extent dependent on having access to the international funding markets

<<<

.
Moreover, liquidity is adjusted to the maturity profile of exposures to enable the Group to honour debt and guarantee exposures as they mature. In addition, the Board of Directors has set requirements concerning the Bank's ability to withstand

<<<

 a run-off of capital market funding, defined in terms of the interbank market and Global MTN issues, and at the same time finance a normal growth in loans and advances.
As a consequence of Sydbank's status as SIFI (as defined below), the Group

<<<

 has been required to meet the liquidity coverage requirements (the LCR) of 100 per cent. from 1st October, 2015, which the Group has done. The LCR is a short-term (30 days) idiosyncratic stress scenario
Notwithstanding the policies and protocols

<<<

 that the Bank has put in place, there can be no assurance that the Bank will not suffer losses from liquidity risk in the future that may be material in amount.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss as a result

<<<

 of inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events and includes legal risk.
For the purpose of monitoring the Bank's operational risk exposure to products and business lines, information of risk-related losses

<<<

 is collected on an ongoing and systematic basis. In line with the ideas of Basel III, loss data is ascribed to event type and business line. There can be no assurance that the Bank will not suffer losses from operational risks in the future

<<<

 that may be material in amount.
Notwithstanding anything in the risk factor, this risk factor should not be taken as implying that either the Issuer or the Group will be unable to comply with its obligations as a company with securities admitted

<<<

 to the Official List.
Reputation risk
Reputation risk is the risk of losses due to external circumstances or events that could harm the Bank's reputation or earnings. Reputational risk is managed through policies and business procedures. However

<<<

, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will not suffer losses from reputation risk in the future that may be material in amount.
16

Downturn in economy
Sydbank's business activities are dependent on the level of banking, finance and financial

<<<

 services required by its customers. In particular, levels of borrowing are dependent on customer confidence, employment trends, the state of the economy, the housing market and market interest rates at the time. As Sydbank currently conducts

<<<

 the majority of its business in Denmark, its performance is influenced by the level and cyclical nature of business activity in Denmark, which is in turn affected by both domestic and international economic and political events.
Notwithstanding

<<<

 that Sydbank believes it is well positioned to deal with a downturn in the economy, an increase in unemployment in Denmark or a reduction in the value of housing and other collateral provided to Sydbank would increase the losses to Sydbank

<<<

 and may be in a material amount.
Impact o f regulatory changes
Sydbank is subject to financial services laws, regulations, administrative actions and policies in Denmark. Changes in supervision and regulation could materially affect Sydbank

<<<

's business, the products and services offered or the value of its assets. Although Sydbank monitors the situation, future changes in regulation, fiscal or other policies can be unpredictable and are beyond the control of Sydbank.
The final

<<<

 versions of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (the CRR) and the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements

<<<

 for credit institutions and investment firms (the CRD IV Directive) were adopted in June 2013. The CRR entered into force on 1st January, 2014, whereas the CRD IV Directive was implemented in Denmark in March 2014. The framework implemented

<<<

 among other things the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposed new standards for bank capital and liquidity requirements (Basel III) in the European Union. Each of the CRR and the CRD IV Directive covers a wide range of prudential

<<<

 requirements for banks across Member States, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, riskexposure amounts (REA), leverage ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements. The CRD IV

<<<

 Directive covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual risk assessment) and other measures such as the combined capital buffer requirements, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), governance and

<<<

 remuneration requirements.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) will continue to propose detailed rules through binding technical standards, guidelines, recommendations and/or opinions in respect of many areas, including liquidity requirements

<<<

 and certain aspects of capital requirements. As a consequence, the Group is subject to the risk of possible interpretational changes. Given the uncertainty of the exact wording of the technical standards, they could potentially lead to a reduction

<<<

 in the regulatory capital or an increase in the REA of the Group. Furthermore, the CRD IV Directive contains rules which enable the competent authorities to increase capital requirements to previously unforeseen levels which potentially could

<<<

 limit the Group's ability to fulfil its present strategy, leading to lower than expected earnings and/or higher than expected REA.
Under the CRD IV Directive, institutions are required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital equal to

<<<

 8 per cent. of REA (of which at least 4.5 per cent. must be Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and at least 6 per cent. must be Tier 1 capital). In addition to these so-called minimum own funds Pillar I requirements (the minimum own funds requirement

<<<

), the CRD IV Directive (including, but not limited to, Article 128) also introduces capital buffer requirements in addition to the minimum own funds requirements, which must be met with Common Equity Tier 1 capital. For Sydbank, the capital

<<<

 buffer is comprised of three elements (referred to collectively as the combined buffer requirement): (i) the capital conservation buffer; (ii) the institution-specific countercyclical buffer; and (iii) the system risk buffer. Subject to applicable

<<<

 transitional provisions these capital buffers apply to the Issuer. The capital conservation buffer is to be fully implemented by 1st January, 2019 where a 2.5 per cent. requirement will apply to the Issuer. In 2018, a capital conservation buffer

<<<

 of 1.875 per cent. of the REA will apply to the Issuer. The countercyclical buffer is calculated as a weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the jurisdiction where the credit institution's credit exposures are located

<<<

. In 2017, the countercyclical buffer rate for Danish credit exposure was set at 0 per cent. by the Danish Minister for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs. The countercyclical buffer rate for the first quarter of 2018 has been set at 

<<<

0.5 per cent. with effect from 31st March, 2019.
17

In June 2014, the DFSA appointed Sydbank to be a Danish SIFI. In June 2015, June 2016 and June 2017, Sydbank was re-appointed as a SIFI. The systemic risk buffer will be gradually implemented

<<<

 in the period 2015 to 2019. Sydbank will be subject to a further buffer requirement of 0.8 per cent. as regards Common Equity Tier 1 capital as of 2018, which will rise to 1 per cent. in 2019. The intention is to bring Danish SIFI capital requirements

<<<

 on a par with the requirements in other comparable European countries.
In addition to the minimum own funds requirements described above, the CRD IV Directive (including, but not limited to, Article 104(1)(a)) contemplates that competent authorities

<<<

 may require additional Pillar II capital to be maintained by an institution relating to elements of risks which are not fully captured by the minimum own funds requirements (additional own funds requirements) or to address macro-prudential

<<<

 requirements.
The EBA published guidelines on 19th December, 2014 addressed to national supervisors on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) which contained guidelines proposing a common

<<<

 approach to determining the amount and composition of additional own funds requirements and which was implemented by 1st January, 2016. Under these guidelines, national supervisors should set a composition requirement for the additional own

<<<

 funds requirements to cover certain risks of at least 56 per cent. Common Equity Tier 1 capital and at least 75 per cent. Tier 1 capital. The guidelines also contemplate that national supervisors should not set additional own funds requirements

<<<

 in respect of risks which are already covered by capital buffer requirements and/or additional macro-prudential requirements; and, accordingly, the combined buffer requirement is in addition to the minimum own funds requirement and to the additional

<<<

 own funds requirement. The SREP was implemented in Denmark with effect as of 1st January, 2016 by Executive Order no. 1587 of 3rd December, 2015 on Capital to Fulfil the Individual Solvency Requirement of Credit Institutions. According hereto

<<<

 institutions' additional own funds requirement shall be met with at least 56 per cent. Common Equity Tier 1 capital and at least 75 per cent. Tier 1 capital. The remaining 25 per cent. of the additional own funds requirement may be fulfilled

<<<

 with Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Additional Tier 1 capital (such as the Notes) or Tier 2 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital instruments issued prior to 31st December, 2015 that until 31st December, 2015 were eligible to

<<<

 cover institutions' additional own funds requirements will be grandfathered until 31st December, 2021.
As set out in the "Opinion of the European Banking Authority on the interaction of Pillar I, Pillar II and combined buffer requirements and

<<<

 restrictions on distributions" published on 16th December, 2015 (the December 2015 EBA Opinion), in the EBA's opinion competent authorities should ensure that the Common Equity Tier 1 capital to be taken into account in determining the Common

<<<

 Equity Tier 1 capital available to meet the combined buffer requirement for the purposes of the Maximum Distributable Amount calculation is limited to the amount not used to meet the Pillar I and Pillar II own funds requirements of the institution

<<<

. In addition, the December 2015 EBA Opinion advises the European Commission (i) to review Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive with a view to avoiding differing interpretations of Article 141(6) and ensure greater consistency between the Maximum

<<<

 Distributable Amount framework and the capital stacking order described in the opinion and in the EBA's SREP guidelines and (ii) to review the prohibition on distributions in all circumstances where an institution fails to meet the combined

<<<

 buffer requirement and no profits are made in any given year, notably insofar as it relates to Additional Tier 1 capital instruments (such as the Notes).
As at 31st December, 2017, the Issuer fulfilled its additional own funds requirement and

<<<

 its combined buffer requirement with a margin of respectively 9.3 percentage points and 7.9 percentage points.
There can be no assurance as to the relationship between any of the aforementioned or future incremental additional own funds requirements

<<<

, the combined buffer requirement and the restrictions on discretionary payments, including as to the consequences for an institution of its capital levels falling below the combined buffer requirement, the additional own funds requirement and

<<<

 the minimum own funds requirement referred to above. There can also be no assurance as to the manner in which additional own funds requirements may be disclosed publicly in the future and under Danish law certain disclosure rules already apply

<<<

. A Danish credit institution is required to disclose its additional own funds requirement either twice a year or each quarter. Furthermore, any additional own funds requirement laid down by the DFSA is required to be published on the website

<<<

 of the relevant credit institution.
The capital requirements applicable to the Issuer are, by their nature, calculated by reference to a number of factors any one of which or combination of which may not be easily observable or capable of calculation

<<<

 by
18

investors. Noteholders may not be able to predict accurately the proximity of the risk of discretionary payments (of interest and principal) on the Notes being prohibited from time to time as a result of the operation of Article 14

<<<

1 of the CRD IV Directive as implemented in Denmark. See also "Cancellation o f Interest" below.
In addition, the CRR and the CRD IV Directive includes a requirement for credit institutions to calculate, report, monitor and publish their leverage

<<<

 ratios, defined as their Tier 1 capital, as a percentage of their total exposure measure. According to the CRR Amendment Proposal (as defined below) the leverage ratio requirement will be set at a level of minimum 3 per cent.. Until the adoption

<<<

 of the CRR Amendment Proposal (as defined below) the regulators may apply such measures as they consider appropriate. In Denmark the risk of excessive leverage is addressed under Pillar II.
On the 23rd November, 2016, the European Commission

<<<

 proposed a reform of the CRR and the CRD IV Directive by way of a proposal (COM(2016) 850) to amend the CRR (the CRR Amendment Proposal) and by way of a proposal (COM(2016) 852) to amend the CRD IV Directive (together with the CRR Amendment

<<<

 Proposal, the CRR/CRD IV Amendment Proposal). The CRR/CRD IV Amendment Proposal introduces, among other things, a leverage ratio requirement of 3 per cent. Tier 1 capital, a harmonised binding requirement for stable funding (the Net Stable

<<<

 Funding Ratio or NSFR), strengthening of the conditions for use of internal models and changes to the relevant regulator's application of the institution specific Pillar II capital add-ons (referred to above as the additional own funds requirements

<<<

). At the date of this Prospectus it is still uncertain whether and if so, to what extent, the CRR/CRD IV Amendment Proposal will impose additional capital, liquidity and/or leverage requirements on the Group, which in turn may affect the Issuer

<<<

's capacity to fulfil its obligations under the Notes.
On 7 December 2017, the Basel Committee agreed on a new regulatory framework containing, among other things, a number o f changes to and restrictions for credit institutions using internal

<<<

 models (informally referred to as Basel IV).
The Basel IV framework includes a number of different requirements. The Issuer believes that the most important component for it is the introduction of a so-called capital floor requirement for credit

<<<

 institutions applying internal ratings-based risk models. The capital floor requirement entails that a credit institution will be subject to a minimum capital requirement across risk types (credit, market and operational risk) of 72.5 per cent

<<<

. of the capital requirement calculated according to the standardised approach. According to the Basel IV framework, a minimum capital requirement of 50 per cent. will apply to the Issuer as early as 2022 and will gradually increase until fully

<<<

 implemented in 2027. The recommendations are expected to have a limited impact on the Group's capital.
There can be no assurance, however, that the leverage ratio specified above, or any of the minimum own funds requirements, additional own

<<<

 funds requirements or combined buffer requirements applicable to the Group will not be amended in the future to include new and more onerous capital requirements, which in turn may affect the Issuer's capacity to make payments of interest on

<<<

 the Notes.
Risks related to the structure of the Notes
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are subordinated
Subject to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), the Notes will constitute direct

<<<

, unconditional, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations o f the Issuer as described in Condition 4 (Status o f the Notes).
The Issuer may issue other obligations or capital instruments that rank or are expressed to rank senior to the Notes

<<<

 or pari passu to the Notes, in each case as regards the right to receive periodic payments (to the extent any such periodic payment has not been cancelled) on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital

<<<

 on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer will be required to pay (i) its depositors, (ii) its other unsubordinated creditors and (iii) its other subordinated creditors

<<<

 other than the present or future claims of creditors that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes in full before it can make any payments on the Notes. If this occurs, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining

<<<

 after these payments are made to pay amounts due under the Notes. In addition, in the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, to the extent the Issuer has assets remaining after paying its creditors who rank senior to the Notes

<<<

, payments relating to other obligations or capital
19

instruments of the Issuer that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with the Notes may, if there are insufficient assets to satisfy the claims of all of the Issuer's pari passu creditors

<<<

, further reduce the assets available to pay amounts due under the Notes on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Although the Notes may pay a higher rate of interest than securities which are not, or not as deeply, subordinated, there

<<<

 is a real risk that an investor in deeply subordinated securities such as the Notes will lose all or some of its investment on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Loss absorptionfollowing a Trigger Event
The Notes are being issued for

<<<

 regulatory capital adequacy purposes with the intention and purpose of being eligible as Additional Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer and the Group. Such eligibility depends upon a number of conditions being satisfied, which are reflected in the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions of the Notes and which, in particular, require the Notes and the proceeds of their issue to be available to absorb any losses of the Issuer and/or the Group.
Accordingly, if at any time the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital

<<<

 Ratio of the Issuer and the Group has fallen below the Trigger Event Threshold, the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall be reduced as described below and in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes

<<<

). Therefore, any indication or perceived indication that the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group is trending towards the Trigger Event Threshold may have an adverse impact on the market price of the Notes.
Noteholders

<<<

 may lose all or some of their investment as a result of such a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts. In the case of any such reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts, in compliance with the CRD IV and BRRD requirements and subject

<<<

 to the Loss Absorption Minimum Amount, the amount of the relevant reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts on the Write Down Date will be equal to the amount of a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts on the Write Down Date that

<<<

 would restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, to at least the Trigger Event Threshold at the point of such reduction, taking into account the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (if any

<<<

) of the Issuer and/or the Group, as the case may be, generated on or prior to the Write Down Date by the pro rata reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of all

<<<

 Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments (if any) outstanding at such time. For the avoidance of doubt, the Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes do not constitute Other Loss Absorbing Instruments.
It is possible that, following a material decrease

<<<

 in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, a Trigger Event could occur simultaneously with a trigger event in relation to one or more Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments having, as the case may be, (i) a higher

<<<

, (ii) an identical or (iii) a lower trigger level than the Trigger Event Threshold in respect of the Notes. In such circumstances, investors should note that, with respect to each such Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instrument (if any), Condition

<<<

 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) provides that the pro rata reduction or, as the case may be, conversion shall only be taken into account as described above to the extent required to restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio

<<<

 of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, to the Trigger Event Threshold or, if lower, such Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instrument's trigger level. Once the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable

<<<

, has been restored to at least the Trigger Event Threshold at the point of the relevant reduction, the Issuer expects that any additional amounts of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital which are required to cure a trigger event in relation to any

<<<

 Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments with a higher trigger level (Higher Trigger Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments) than the Trigger Event Threshold will only be generated by the further reduction to, or, as the case may be, further conversion

<<<

 into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of such Higher Trigger Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments, in each case in accordance with the terms of such Higher Trigger Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments and the

<<<

 CRD IV requirements.
Investors should also note that, if the Issuer issues any Full Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments, the Issuer expects that such Full Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments shall be treated for the purposes of determining the relevant

<<<

 pro rata amounts to be taken into account as described above and in Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) as if their terms permitted partial reduction or, as the case may be, partial conversion into Common Equity Tier 

<<<

1 Capital instruments.
20

In addition, investors should note that Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) provides that, to the extent the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital

<<<

 instruments of, the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing AT 1 Instrument is not, or by the Write Down Date will not be, effective for any reason:
(A) the ineffectiveness of any such reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into

<<<

 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments shall not prejudice the requirement to effect a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes); and

<<<


(B) the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instrument which is not, or by the Write Down Date will not be, effective shall

<<<

 not be taken into account in determining the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event).
Therefore (i) the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common

<<<

 Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing AT 1 Instruments is not a condition to a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts and (ii) as a result of any failure to reduce or, as the case may

<<<

 be, convert into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments, the amount of the reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts may therefore be higher than expected.
As any such

<<<

 reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts is subject to compliance with the CRD IV and BRRD requirements, the reduction provisions described above and in Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) are subject to, and will

<<<

 be interpreted in light of, any applicable changes to any such requirements. Notwithstanding any of the provisions relating to a reduction of the Notes as described above, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will not determine that the

<<<

 CRD IV requirements require a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts to be calculated and determined in a different manner than as described above and in Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event). Investors should note

<<<

 that, in the case of any such reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event), the Issuer's determination of the relevant amount of such reduction shall be binding on all

<<<

 parties.
Any such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall not constitute an event of default under the terms of the Notes and, following such reduction, Noteholders' claims in respect of principal will, in all cases, be based on

<<<

 the reduced Outstanding Principal Amounts to the extent the Outstanding Principal Amounts have not subsequently been reinstated as described in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes).
In addition

<<<

, following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest can only continue to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amounts following such reduction, which will be lower than the Original Principal Amount of the

<<<

 Notes.
Following any such reduction, the Issuer will not in any circumstances be obliged to reinstate the Outstanding Principal Amounts, but any reinstatement must be undertaken, subject to compliance with CRD IV requirements and the Reinstatement

<<<

 Limit described in Condition 7.2 (Reinstatement of the Notes), on a pro rata basis with all other Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments (if any) which would, following such reinstatement, constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital and feature

<<<

 similar reinstatement provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes do not constitute Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments. Investors should note that, while the Terms and Conditions of the Notes provide

<<<

 for a pro rata reinstatement as described in the preceding sentence, there is no guarantee (including as regards the timing of the relevant reinstatement) how a reinstatement of the Outstanding Principal Amounts would be conducted when compared

<<<

 to any proposed reinstatement of any obligations or capital instruments of the Issuer (i) with a similar principal loss absorption mechanism but with a higher or lower trigger level compared to the Trigger Event Threshold and (ii) which include

<<<

 similar reinstatement provisions.
Investors should note that, while such a reduction is not common, it is an appreciable risk and is not limited to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.

Resolution tools andpowers under the BRRD

<<<


On 15th May, 2014, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted a directive providing for the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (Directive

<<<

 2014/59/EU) (the BRRD). The BRRD, including the general bail-in tool and MREL has been implemented into Danish law with effect as of 1st June, 2015 by Consolidated Act No. 333 of 31st March, 2015 on Restructuring and Resolution of Certain Financial

<<<

 Undertakings as amended from time to time (the Danish Recovery and Resolution Act) and by amendments to the Danish Financial Business Act.
The BRRD is designed to provide authorities designated by Member States with a credible set of tools

<<<

 to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in relation to unsound or failing credit institutions, investment firms, certain financial institutions and certain holding companies (each, a relevant entity) to ensure the continuity of the relevant

<<<

 entity's critical financial and economic functions while minimising the impact of a relevant entity's failure on the economy and financial system.
The BRRD contains various resolution powers which may be used alone or in combination where the

<<<

 relevant resolution authority considers that (a) a relevant entity is failing or likely to fail, (b) there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures would prevent the failure of such relevant entity within a reasonable

<<<

 timeframe, and (c) a resolution action is in the public interest. The relevant resolution authority may use the following resolution tools and powers alone or in combination without the consent of the relevant entity's creditors: (i) sale of

<<<

 business - which enables resolution authorities to direct the sale of the relevant entity or the whole or part of its business on commercial terms; (ii) bridge institution - which enables resolution authorities to transfer all or part of the

<<<

 business of the relevant entity to a "bridge institution" (an entity created for this purpose that is wholly or partially in public control), which may limit the capacity of the relevant entity to meet its repayment obligations; (iii) asset

<<<

 separation - which enables resolution authorities to transfer assets to one or more publicly owned asset management vehicles to allow them to be managed with a view to maximising their value through eventual sale or orderly wind-down (this

<<<

 can be used together with another resolution tool only); and (iv) bail-in - which gives resolution authorities the power to write down certain claims of unsecured creditors of a failing relevant entity (the write-down may result in the reduction

<<<

 of such claims to zero) and to convert certain unsecured debt claims (including the Notes) to equity or other instruments of ownership (the general bailin tool). The converted equity or other instruments could also be subject to any future

<<<

 application of the general bail-in tool.
As a last resort, and after having assessed and applied the above resolution tools to the maximum extent possible whilst maintaining financial stability, the BRRD also provides a Member State the ability

<<<

 to provide extraordinary public financial support through additional financial stabilisation tools. These consist of public equity support and temporary public ownership tools. Any such extraordinary financial support must be provided in accordance

<<<

 with the EU state aid framework.
A relevant entity will be considered as failing or likely to fail when either: (i) it is, or is likely in the near future to be, in breach of its requirements for continuing authorisation; (ii) its assets are

<<<

, or are likely in the near future to be, less than its liabilities; (iii) it is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iv) it requires extraordinary public financial support (except in limited

<<<

 circumstances).
In addition to the general bail-in tool, the BRRD provides for resolution authorities to have the further power to permanently write-down or convert into equity, capital instruments (such as the Notes), at the point of non viability

<<<

 and before any other resolution action is taken (non-viability loss absorption). Any shares issued to Noteholders upon any such conversion into equity may also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool and/or the other resolution

<<<

 powers outlined above. Resolution authorities are required to implement non viability loss absorption ahead of, or simultaneously with, any resolution action.
Any application of the general bail-in tool and non-viability loss absorption under

<<<

 the BRRD shall be in accordance with the hierarchy of claims in normal insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, the impact of such application on Noteholders will depend on their ranking in accordance with such hierarchy, including any priority

<<<

 given to other creditors such as depositors.
22

To the extent any resulting treatment of Noteholders pursuant to the exercise of any resolution tool is less favourable than would have been the case under such hierarchy in normal insolvency

<<<

 proceedings, a Noteholder has a right to compensation under the BRRD based on an independent valuation of the firm (which is referred to as the "no creditor worse o ff' principle under the BRRD). Any such compensation is unlikely to compensate

<<<

 that holder for the losses it has actually incurred and there is likely to be a considerable delay in the recovery of such compensation. Compensation payments (if any) are also likely to be made considerably later than when amounts may otherwise

<<<

 have been due under the Notes.
For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point of non-viability under the BRRD is the point at which (i) the relevant authority determines that the relevant entity

<<<

 meets the conditions for resolution (but no resolution action has yet been taken) or (ii) the relevant authority or authorities, as the case may be, determine(s) that the relevant entity or its group will no longer be viable unless the relevant

<<<

 capital instruments (such as the Notes) are written-down or converted or (iii) extraordinary public financial support is required by the relevant entity or its group other than, where the entity is an institution, for the purposes of remedying

<<<

 a serious disturbance in the economy of an EEA member state and to preserve financial stability.
The BRRD (and thereby also the Danish Recovery and Resolution Act) also provides resolution authorities with broader powers to implement other

<<<

 resolution measures with respect to distressed banks, which may include (without limitation) the replacement or substitution of the bank as obligor in respect of debt instruments, modifications to the terms of debt instruments (including altering

<<<

 the amount of interest payable and/or imposing a temporary suspension on payments) and discontinuing the listing and admission to trading of financial instruments.
With the implementation of the BRRD, European banks are required to have bail

<<<

 in-able resources in order to fulfil the Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL). There is no minimum EU-wide level of MREL - each resolution authority is required to make a separate determination of the appropriate

<<<

 MREL requirement for each resolution group within its jurisdiction, depending on the resolvability, risk profile, systemic importance and other characteristics of each institution. The DFSA on 23rd March, 2018 set the MREL requirement for Sydbank

<<<

 to 12.4 per cent. of Sydbank's total liabilities and own funds, corresponding to twice its total capital requirement (solvency need plus the combined buffer requirement). This is in accordance with a fact sheet published by the DFSA on 23rd

<<<

 March, 2018 regarding the principles for the MREL requirement for Danish SIFI banks. The MREL requirement set for Sydbank, which corresponds to 27.3 per cent. of Sydbank's REA, must be complied with as of 1st July, 2019. The MREL requirement

<<<

 must be met with own fund instruments and debt instruments which in resolution and bankruptcy can be written down and converted before unsubordinated claims and otherwise fulfil the requirements for eligible liabilities. Debt instruments issued

<<<

 before 1st January, 2018 which in resolution and bankruptcy cannot be written down and converted before unsubordinated claims, but that otherwise fulfil the requirements for eligible liabilities, can be used to fulfil the MREL requirement until

<<<

 1st January, 2022. The MREL requirement will be set annually on the basis of the entity's annual update of its individual resolution plan and it is the DFSA, following consultation with Finansiel Stabilitet, which sets the MREL requirement

<<<

 for each relevant entity. If an institution does not fulfil the MREL requirement, the relevant authority may withdraw its banking licence. Also, a comparable concept for loss absorption, Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) has been set for

<<<

 G-SIIs. The TLAC requirement takes effect from 2019. The implementation of a TLAC requirement for G-SIIs in the EU could influence the implementation of MREL and therefore could impact the required MREL for the Issuer.
The powers set out in

<<<

 the already adopted BRRD will impact how credit institutions and investment firms are managed, as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors. The BRRD outlines the priority ranking of certain deposits in an insolvency hierarchy

<<<

, which required changes to the insolvency hierarchy in Denmark. The BRRD establishes a preference in the ordinary insolvency hierarchy, firstly for insured depositors and, secondly, for all other deposits of individuals and micro, small and

<<<

 medium-sized enterprises held in the EEA or non-EEA branches of an EEA bank. These preferred deposits rank ahead of all other unsecured senior creditors of the Issuer in the insolvency hierarchy. Furthermore, the insolvency hierarchy could

<<<

 be changed in the future.
The exercise of any power under the BRRD and/or the Danish Recovery and Resolution Act and/or the Danish Financial Business Act and/or non-viability loss absorption and/or statutory loss absorption powers, or any suggestion

<<<

 of such exercise, could have a material adverse effect on the rights of Noteholders, the price or value of their investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. Although
23

the BRRD, as

<<<

 implemented, contains certain limited safeguards for creditors in specific circumstances, including in the case of senior creditors a safeguard that aims to ensure that they do not incur greater losses than they would have incurred had the

<<<

 relevant financial institution been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings, there can be no assurance that these safeguards will be effective if such powers are exercised. The determination that any power under the BRRD shall be exercised

<<<

 or that all or a part of the principal amount of the Notes will be subject to bail-in is likely to be inherently unpredictable and may depend on a number of factors which may be outside of the Group's control. The application of the general

<<<

 bail-in tool with respect to the Notes may result in the write-down or cancellation of all, or a portion of, the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, and/or interest on, the Notes and/or the conversion of all, or

<<<

 a portion, of the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, or interest on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of the Issuer or another person, including by means of a variation to the terms

<<<

 of the Notes to give effect to such application of the general bail-in tool. Accordingly, potential investors in the Notes should consider the risk that the general bail-in tool may be applied in such a manner as to result in Noteholders losing

<<<

 all or a part of the value of their investment in the Notes or receiving a different security than the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded

<<<

 to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant resolution authority may exercise its authority to apply the general bailin tool without providing any advance notice to the Noteholders.
On 23rd November, 2016, the European Commission, together with

<<<

 the CRD IV Amendment Proposal, proposed a reform of the BRRD by way of two proposals (COM(2016) 852 and COM(2016) 853) to amend the BRRD (together the BRRD Amendment Proposal). The BRRD Amendment Proposal includes, among other things, the introduction

<<<

 of a higher MREL requirement to take form as MREL guidance. Consistent and repeated breaches of the MREL guidance may result in the MREL guidance being converted into a MREL requirement. In addition, if the institution cannot replace liabilities

<<<

 that cease to meet the MREL eligibility criteria, the institution's Common Equity Tier 1 capital will be used to comply with the MREL requirement to extinguish a resultant shortfall in eligible liabilities. This could entail that the institution

<<<

 would not be able to meet its combined buffer requirement. At the date of this Prospectus it is still uncertain whether and if so, to what extent, the proposed amendments will impose additional capital requirements on the Issuer, which in turn

<<<

 may affect the Issuer's capacity to fulfil its obligations under the Notes.
Depositor preference
As part of the reforms required by the BRRD, amendments have been made to relevant legislation in Denmark to establish a preference in the insolvency

<<<

 hierarchy for certain deposits that are eligible for protection by the Danish Deposit Guarantee Scheme and the uninsured element of such deposits and, in certain circumstances, deposits made in non-EEA branches. In addition, the Danish implementation

<<<

 of the Revised Deposit Guarantee Scheme increased the nature and quantum of insured deposits to cover a wide range of deposits, including certain corporate deposits (unless the depositor is a public sector body or financial institution) and

<<<

 some temporary high value deposits. The effect of these changes is to increase the size of the class of preferred creditors. All such preferred deposits will rank in the insolvency hierarchy ahead of all other unsecured creditors of the Issuer

<<<

, including the Noteholders. Furthermore, insured deposits are excluded from the scope of the general bail-in tool. As a result, if the general bail-in tool were exercised by the relevant resolution authority, the Notes would be more likely

<<<

 to be bailed-in than certain other unsubordinated liabilities of the Issuer such as other preferred deposits.
No scheduled redemption
The Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for redemption. The Issuer is under no obligation

<<<

 to redeem the Notes at any time (except as provided in Condition 8 (Redemption and Purchase) and, in any such case, subject always to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc)). There will be no redemption at the option of the Noteholders

<<<

 in any circumstances. Therefore, prospective investors in the Notes should be aware that they will be required to bear the financial risks associated with an investment in long term securities.
Cancellation o f Interest
Subject as provided

<<<

 in Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), any payment of interest in respect of the Notes shall be payable only out of the Issuer's Distributable Items and:
24

(i)

may be cancelled, at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer

<<<

 in its sole discretion; or

(ii) will be mandatorily cancelled, in whole or in part, to the extent:

(A) that, if the relevant payment were so made, the amount of such payment, when aggregated together with other distributions of the kind referred

<<<

 to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (or, as the case may be, any provision of Danish law transposing or implementing Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive), or any other analogous position thereto under the CRD IV requirements, would

<<<

 cause a breach of any regulatory restriction or prohibition on payments on Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments relating to any applicable Maximum Distributable Amount; or

(B) otherwise so required by CRD IV, including the applicable criteria

<<<

 for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, or where the Relevant Regulator requires the Issuer to cancel the relevant payment in whole or in part.

The CRD IV requirements currently provide that discretionary payments in respect o f certain

<<<

 capital instruments (including payments o f interest on the Notes, which would include, fo r the avoidance o f doubt, any Additional Amounts in respect o f interest which may be payable under Condition 10 (Taxation)) will be required to be

<<<

 cancelled, in whole or in part, to the extent that:

(i)

the Issuer's Distributable Items are insufficient to make the relevant payment(s); or

(ii) the combined buffer requirement is not met and, if the relevant payment(s) were made, the

<<<

 amount of such payment(s) would exceed the Maximum Distributable Amount. See further the risk factor "Impact o f regulatory changes" above.

The Issuer also expects to cancel any such discretionary payment to the extent that the CRD IV prescribes

<<<

 and/or, as the case may be, the Relevant Regulator requires that the relevant payment(s) shall be cancelled.

The Issuer's Distributable Items will depend to a large extent on the net income earned by the Issuer. The determination of the Maximum

<<<

 Distributable Amount is subject to some uncertainty. Under Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive, EU Member States must require that institutions that fail to meet the combined buffer requirement (broadly, the combination of the capital conservation

<<<

 buffer, the institution-specific counter-cyclical buffer and the higher of (depending on the institution), the systemic risk buffer, the global systemically important institutions buffer and, in general, the other systemically important institution

<<<

 buffer, in each case as applicable to the institution) will be subject to restricted "discretionary payments" (which are defined broadly by CRD IV as distributions in connection with Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, payments on Additional Tier

<<<

 1 Capital instruments and, under certain conditions, payments of variable remuneration). The restrictions will be scaled according to the extent of the breach of the combined buffer requirement and calculated as a percentage of the profits

<<<

 of the institution since the most recent decision on the distribution of profits or discretionary payment. Such calculation will result in a "maximum distributable amount" in each relevant period. As an example, the scaling is such that in

<<<

 the bottom quartile of the combined buffer requirement, no discretionary distributions will be permitted to be paid. As a consequence, in the event of breach of the combined buffer requirement it may be necessary to reduce discretionary payments

<<<

, including potentially exercising the discretion to cancel (in whole or in part) interest payments in respect of the Notes. Moreover in the event that the combined buffer requirement is no longer met by the credit institution it will be required

<<<

 to submit a capital conservation plan to the Relevant Regulator and if the capital conservation plan is not approved by the Relevant Regulator more stringent restrictions on distributions, than those required subject to Article 141 of the CRD

<<<

 IV Directive, can be imposed on the credit institution. Further, there can be no assurance that any of the combined buffer requirements applicable to the Issuer and/or the Group will not be increased in the future, which may exacerbate the

<<<

 risk that discretionary payments, including payments of interest on the Notes, are cancelled. See further the risk factor "Impact o f regulatory changes" above.

As discussed above, the Issuer is entitled to cancel payments of interest in its

<<<

 sole discretion and it is permitted to do so even if it could make such payments without exceeding the limits described in the paragraph immediately above. Notwithstanding the above expectations, payments of interest on the Notes may be cancelled

<<<

 even if (i)

25

holders of the Issuer's shares continue to receive dividends and/or (ii) Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes (if any) remain outstanding and holders of those Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes continue to receive interest

<<<

 payments. It is the Issuer's current intention that, whenever exercising its discretion to propose any dividend in respect of the Issuer's shares, or the payment of interest to holders of outstanding Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes (if

<<<

 any) or its discretion to cancel payments of interest on the Notes, the Issuer will take into account the relative ranking of these instruments in its capital structure. However, the Issuer may at any time depart from this policy at its sole

<<<

 discretion.
Following any cancellation of interest as described above, the right of Noteholders to receive accrued interest in respect of the relevant Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will have no further obligation to pay such

<<<

 interest or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned for any purpose nor will the non-payment

<<<

 of such interest constitute an event of default under the Notes.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest payments will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation

<<<

 provision of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes

<<<

 in the financial condition of the Issuer and/or the Group. Noteholders should be aware that any announcement relating to the future cancellation of interest payments or any actual cancellation of interest payments may have an adverse effect

<<<

 on the market price of the Notes. Noteholders may find it difficult to sell their Notes in such circumstances, or may only be able to sell their Notes at a price which may be significantly lower than the price at which they purchased their

<<<

 Notes. In such event, Noteholders may lose some or substantially all of their investment in the Notes.
Anyfailure by the Issuer and/or the Group to comply with its MREL requirement could result, among other things, in the imposition o f restrictions

<<<

 or prohibitions on discretionary payments by the Issuer, including the payment o f interest on the Notes
As outlined in the risk factor "Resolution tools and powers under the BRRD" above, the regulatory framework around the MREL requirement

<<<

 is subject to the BRRD Amendment Proposal, the provisions and implementation of which remain uncertain. If the BRRD Amendment Proposal is adopted in its current form, a failure by the Issuer and/or the Group to comply with the MREL requirement

<<<

 means the Issuer could become subject to the restrictions on payments on Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, including the Notes (subject to a potential sixmonth grace period in case specific conditions are met). Any actual or anticipated

<<<

 failure by the Issuer and/or the Group to comply with the MREL requirement will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. Noteholders may find it difficult to sell their Notes in such circumstances, or may only be able

<<<

 to sell their Notes at a price which may be significantly lower than the price at which they purchased their Notes. In such event, Noteholders may lose some or substantially all of their investment in the Notes.
Notes subject to optional redemption

<<<

 by the Issuer on certain call dates or upon the occurrence of a Special Event
Subject as provided herein, in particular to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes

<<<

 on the First Call Date or on any Interest Payment Date thereafter at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled. Subject as aforesaid, upon the occurrence of a Special Event

<<<

, the Issuer may also, at its option, at any time redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled.
Noteholders should

<<<

 note that the Issuer may redeem the Notes as described in the previous paragraph even if (i) the Outstanding Principal Amounts have been so reduced and (ii) the principal amount of the Notes has not been fully reinstated to the original principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes.
An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem or is perceived to be likely to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally

<<<

 will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.
26

The Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the

<<<

 Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower

<<<

 rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
Substitution and variation o f the Notes without Noteholder consent
Subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc), 

<<<

(i) if a Special Event has occurred and is continuing or (ii) in order to ensure the effectiveness and enforceability of Condition 18.4, the Issuer may, at its option, and without the consent or approval of the Noteholders, elect either (i)

<<<

 to substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes or (ii) to vary the terms of all (but not some only) of the Notes, so that they become or remain Qualifying Capital Notes.
Qualifying Capital Notes are securities issued or guaranteed by the

<<<

 Issuer that have, inter alia, other than in respect of the effectiveness and enforceability of Condition 18.4, terms not materially less favorable to the Noteholders (as a class) than the terms of the Notes (provided that the Issuer shall have

<<<

 delivered a certificate to that effect signed by two of its Directors to the Principal Paying Agent). See Condition 8.6 (Substitution and variation). There can be no assurance that, due to the particular circumstances of each Noteholder, any

<<<

 Qualifying Capital Notes will be as favourable to each Noteholder in all respects or that, if it were entitled to do so, a particular Noteholder would make the same determination as the Issuer as to whether the terms of the relevant Qualifying

<<<

 Capital Notes are not materially less favourable to Noteholders than the terms of the Notes. The Issuer bears no responsibility towards the Noteholders for any adverse effects of such substitution or variation (including, without limitation

<<<

, with respect to any adverse tax consequences suffered by any Noteholder).
No events o f default and limited enforcement rights available to Noteholders
The terms of the Notes do not provide for any events of default. Noteholders may not at

<<<

 any time demand repayment or redemption of their Notes, and enforcement rights for any payment are limited to the claim of Noteholders in a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, a Noteholder

<<<

 may prove or claim in such proceedings in respect of such Note, such claim being for payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount of such Note at the time of commencement of such liquidation or bankruptcy together with any interest accrued and

<<<

 unpaid on such Note (to the extent that the same is not cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Notes) from (and including) the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding commencement of such liquidation or bankruptcy and any other amounts

<<<

 payable on such Note under the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.
According to Section 17(2) of Consolidated Act No. 11 of 6th January, 2014, as amended or replaced from time to time (the Danish Bankruptcy Act) (in Danish: konkursloven), a

<<<

 debtor is insolvent, if it cannot meet its obligations as and when they fall due, unless the inability to meet such obligations may be considered to be temporary. However, according to Section 234(2) of the Danish Financial Business Act, notwithstanding

<<<

 Section 17(2) of the Danish Bankruptcy Act, if the Issuer cannot meet its obligations regarding capital raised as Additional Tier 1 Capital, which as of the date hereof will include the Notes, the Issuer is not considered insolvent. Therefore

<<<

, even if the Issuer cannot meet its obligations regarding capital raised as Additional Tier 1 Capital, the Issuer will not be considered insolvent. Accordingly, a Noteholder may not itself file for the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer

<<<

.
If proceedings with respect to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer should occur, the Noteholders would be required to pursue their claims on the Notes in proceedings with respect to the Issuer in Denmark. In addition, to the extent

<<<

 that the holders are entitled to any recovery with respect to the Notes in any such Danish bankruptcy proceedings, such holders would be entitled to a recovery in Danish Kroner or, as the case may be, other currencies, which would be based

<<<

 on the relevant conversion rate in effect on the date the Issuer entered into such liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings.
27

The marketprice and liquidity o f the Notes may be volatile and will be affected by a number offactors, many o f

<<<

 which may be outside the Issuer's control
The market price and liquidity of the Notes is expected to be affected by fluctuations in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group. Any indication that the Common Equity

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group is trending towards 7.00 per cent. may have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes. The level of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group

<<<

 may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes.
The occurrence of a Trigger Event and, therefore a write-down of the Original Principal Amounts, is inherently unpredictable and depends on a number of factors, many of which may be outside

<<<

 the Issuer's control. Because the Relevant Regulator may require the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios to be calculated as of any date, a Trigger Event could occur at any time. The calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios of

<<<

 the Issuer and/or the Group could be affected by a wide range of factors, including, among other things, factors affecting the level of the Issuer's and/or the Group's earnings or dividend payments, the mix of businesses, the ability to effectively

<<<

 manage the risk exposure amounts in both the ongoing businesses and those the Issuer and/or the Group may seek to exit, losses in commercial banking, investment banking or other businesses, changes in the Group's structure or organisation,

<<<

 or any of the factors described in "Description o f the Sydbank Group". The calculation of the ratios also may be affected by changes in applicable accounting rules and the manner in which accounting policies are applied, including the manner

<<<

 in which permitted discretion is under the applicable accounting rules is exercised.
Due to the uncertainty regarding whether a Trigger Event will occur, it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, the Notes may be written down. In addition

<<<

, it is difficult to predict whether any payment of interest in respect of the Notes will be cancelled pursuant to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. Accordingly, the trading behaviour of the Notes may not necessarily follow the trading

<<<

 behaviour of other types of subordinated securities. Any indication that the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group is approaching the level that would trigger a Trigger Event or that the Maximum Distributable Amount

<<<

 may have been, or is likely to be, exceeded may have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes. The level of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group may significantly affect the trading price

<<<

 of the Notes. Under such circumstances, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to more conventional investments.
Uncertainties remain regarding the manner in which CRD

<<<

 IV w ill be interpreted
The defined terms in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes will depend in some cases on the final interpretation of CRD IV. CRD IV is a recently-adopted set of rules and regulations that imposes a series of new requirements

<<<

, many of which will be phased in over a number of years. Certain portions of the CRD IV Directive required transposition into Danish law, and although the CRR will be directly applicable in each Member State, the CRR leaves a number of important

<<<

 interpretational issues to be resolved through binding technical standards that have been adopted, and will be adopted in the future, and leaves certain other matters to the discretion of the Relevant Regulator. The manner in which the framework

<<<

 and requirements under CRD IV (including the provisions of the CRR/CRD IV Amendment Proposal) will be applied to the Issuer and the Group remains uncertain to a degree.
The determination of the Maximum Distributable Amount is particularly complex

<<<

. The Maximum Distributable Amount imposes a cap on the Issuer's ability to pay interest on the Notes, and on the Issuer's ability to reinstate the principal amounts of the Notes following a reduction upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event.

<<<


The Rate o f Interest will reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date thereafter and could affect the market value o f an investment in the Notes
The Rate of Interest will reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date thereafter

<<<

 and could affect the market value of an investment in the Notes. Such reset Rate of Interest could be less than the Initial Rate of Interest and/or, as applicable, less than the Rate of Interest determined on any previous Reset Date, and could

<<<

 accordingly affect the market value of an investment in the Notes.

 it does not intend to continue to persuade, or use its powers to compel, panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Whilst the announcement related to LIBOR, similar concerns may be applicable

<<<

 to EURIBOR. It is not possible to predict whether, and to what extent, banks will continue to provide EURIBOR submissions to the administrator of EURIBOR going forwards.
The ECB and other European authorities have discussed proposals for alternative

<<<

 benchmarks. For example, the ECB announced plans for a new overnight rate for interbank unsecured lending among Euro-area banks in September 2017. The impact of such an overnight rate on six-month EURIBOR is currently unclear.
Investors should

<<<

 be aware that, if EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on the Notes for the period from (and including) the First Call Date is based on a reset mid-swap rate and will be determined for each relevant Reset

<<<

 Interest Period by the fall-back provisions applicable to the Notes. This may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate in respect of the immediately preceding Reset Interest

<<<

 Period, as provided in the definition of Reset Reference Bank Rate. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and return on the Notes.
No right o f set-off or counterclaim
As provided in the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 of the Notes and as a general principle of Danish law, no Noteholder, who shall in the event of the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer be indebted to the Issuer, shall be entitled to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against

<<<

 moneys owed by the Issuer in respect of the Notes held by such Noteholder.
Risks related to the Notes generally
Because the Notes are held by or on behalf o f Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on the clearing

<<<

 system proceduresfo r transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in the Global Notes, investors will

<<<

 not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are in global form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests

<<<

 only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.
While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to a common depositary. A holder of a beneficial

<<<

 interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made

<<<

 in respect of, beneficial interests in such a Global Note.
Meetings o fNoteholders and modification
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally

<<<

. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority. Any modification of the Terms and

<<<

 Conditions of the Notes pursuant to the operation of such provisions is subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc).
In addition, the Issuer may, subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc), make any modification to

<<<

 the Notes, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the Agency Agreement and/or the Deed of Covenant which is not prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders without the consent of the Noteholders. Any such modification shall be binding on

<<<

 the Noteholders.
29

Credit ratings
The Notes are expected to be rated Ba1 by Moody's. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may

<<<

 affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be reduced, suspended or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.
In addition, rating agencies other than Moody's may assign unsolicited

<<<

 ratings to the Notes. In such circumstances there can be no assurance that the unsolicited rating(s) will not be lower than the comparable ratings assigned to the Notes by Moody's, which could adversely affect the market value and liquidity

<<<

 of the Notes.
The Issuer's credit ratings are important to its business. There can be no assurance that Moody's or any other relevant rating agency will not downgrade the ratings of the Issuer or the ratings of the Issuer's debt instruments

<<<

 (including the Notes) either as a result of the financial position of the Group or changes to applicable rating methodologies used by Moody's or any other relevant rating agency. A rating agency's evaluation of the Issuer may also be based

<<<

 on a number of factors not entirely within the control of the Issuer, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Any reduction in the Issuer's credit ratings or the ratings of its debt instruments, including any

<<<

 unsolicited credit rating, could adversely affect its liquidity and competitive position, undermine confidence in the Issuer and the Group, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets, or limit the range of counterparties

<<<

 willing to enter into transactions with the Issuer and the Group. Such development could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer and the Group's business, financial situation, results of operations, liquidity and/or prospects.
In general

<<<

, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under the CRA Regulation

<<<

 (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended, subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending). Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit

<<<

 ratings issued by non-EU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement

<<<

 action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered and certified rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence of the

<<<

 status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the updated ESMA list. Certain information with respect

<<<

 to the credit rating agencies and ratings is set out on the cover of this Prospectus.
Change o f law
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of this Prospectus, save for the provisions of Condition

<<<

 4 (Status of the Notes), Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), Condition 8.2 (Early redemption upon the occurrence of a Special Event), and Condition 11

<<<

 (Enforcement Events) which will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of Denmark. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English, Danish or other applicable

<<<

 laws, regulations or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.
Notes where denominations involve integral multiples: Definitive Notes
The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum denomination of 200,000 and integral

<<<

 multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof up to and including 399,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples of 200,000. In such a case a Noteholder who, as a result of trading such amount, holds

<<<

 an amount which is less than 200,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in respect of such holding (should Definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes such that its holding amounts to 200,000.
If Definitive Notes are issued, Noteholders should be aware that Definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of 200,000 may be illiquid and difficult

<<<

 to trade.
30

Limitation on gross-up obligation under the Notes The Issuer's obligation to pay Additional Amounts in respect of any withholding or deduction in respect of taxes under the terms of the Notes applies only to payments of interest

<<<

 due and paid under the Notes and not to payments of principal. As such, the Issuer would not be required to pay any Additional Amounts under the terms of the Notes to the extent any withholding or deduction applied to payments of principal

<<<

. Accordingly, if any such withholding or deduction were to apply to any payments of principal under the Notes, Noteholders may receive less than the full amount due under the Notes, and the market value of the Notes may be adversely affected

<<<

. Risks related to the market generally The secondary market generally The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, the market price

<<<

 and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid and any liquidity in such market could be significantly affected by any purchase and cancellation of the Notes by the Issuer or any of

<<<

 its Subsidiaries as provided in Condition 8. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. This is

<<<

 particularly the case for Notes that are especially sensitive to interest rate, currency or market risks, are designed for specific investment objectives or strategies or have been structured to meet the investment requirements of limited categories

<<<

 of investors. Illiquidity may have an adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Exchange rate risks and exchange controls The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency

<<<

 conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the Investor's Currency) other than euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due

<<<

 to devaluation of euro or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative

<<<

 to euro would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency equivalent market value of the Notes. Government

<<<

 and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal

<<<

OVERVIEW OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE IN GLOBAL FORM

Words and expressions defined in 

<<<

"Terms and Conditions o f the Notes " herein shall have the same meanings in this "Overview o f Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form ".

Temporary Global Note exchangeable for Permanent Global Note

The Notes will initially

<<<

 be in the form of the Temporary Global Note, without Coupons, which will be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Interests in the Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable

<<<

, in whole or in part, for interests in the Permanent Global Note, without Coupons, which will also be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, on or after the Exchange Date, upon

<<<

 certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership. Interest payments in respect of the Notes cannot be collected without such certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

Whenever any interest in the Temporary Global Note is to be exchanged

<<<

 for an interest in the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer shall procure (in the case of first exchange) the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of the Permanent Global Note, duly authenticated, to the bearer of the Temporary Global

<<<

 Note or (in the case of any subsequent exchange of a part of the Temporary Global Note) an increase in the principal amount of the Permanent Global Note in accordance with its terms against:

(i)

presentation and (in the case of final exchange

<<<

) surrender of the Temporary Global Note to or to the order

of the Issuing Agent; and

(ii) in either case, receipt by the Issuing Agent of a certificate or certificates of non-U.S. beneficial ownership,

within seven days of the bearer requesting

<<<

 such exchange.

The Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note shall be equal to the aggregate of the original principal amounts specified in the certificates of non-U.S. beneficial ownership as adjusted

<<<

 to reflect any reduction and/or reinstatement pursuant to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) and/or any reduction as otherwise required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable

<<<

 to the Issuer; provided, however, that in no circumstances shall the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note exceed the initial principal amount of the Temporary Global Note.

Permanent Global Note

<<<

 exchangeable for Definitive Notes

Interests in the Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable, in whole but not in part only and at the request of the bearer of the Permanent Global Note, for Definitive Notes, if:

(i)

Euroclear or Clearstream

<<<

, Luxembourg or any other relevant clearing system is closed for business for a

continuous period of fourteen days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention

permanently to cease business or in fact does so; or

(ii

<<<

) any of the circumstances described in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) occurs.

Interests in the Permanent Global Note will also become exchangeable, in whole but not in part only and at the request of the Issuer, for Definitive Notes if

<<<

, by reason of any change in the laws of Denmark, the Issuer will be required to make any withholding or deduction from any payment in respect of the Notes which would not be required if the Notes are in definitive form.

Definitive Notes will

<<<

 have attached thereto at the time of their initial delivery Coupons. Definitive Notes will also, if necessary, have attached thereto at the time of their initial delivery Talons and the expression Coupons shall, where the context so requires

<<<

, include Talons.

34

Whenever the Permanent Global Note is to be exchanged for Definitive Notes, the Issuer shall procure the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of such Definitive Notes, duly authenticated and with Coupons and

<<<

, if necessary, Talons attached, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note to the bearer of the Permanent Global Note against the surrender of the Permanent

<<<

 Global Note to or to the order of the Issuing Agent within thirty days of the bearer requesting such exchange.

Each Definitive Note shall state that its Outstanding Principal Amount may be reduced and/or reinstated pursuant to Condition 7

<<<

 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) or reduced as otherwise required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer and that details thereof may be obtained during normal business

<<<

 hours at the Specified Office of the Issuing Agent.

The Permanent Global Note also provides, inter alia, that:

(i)

if Definitive Notes have not been delivered in accordance with the terms of the Permanent Global Note

by 6.00 p.m. (London

<<<

 time) on the thirtieth day after the day on which such Permanent Global Note

becomes due to be exchanged; or

(ii) if the Permanent Global Note (or any part thereof) becomes due and payable in accordance with the Terms and Conditions or the

<<<

 date for final redemption of the Permanent Global Note has occurred, and, in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due with all accrued interest thereon has not been made on the due date for payment by 6.00 p.m. (London

<<<

 time) on such due date,

then the Permanent Global Note will become void in accordance with its terms but without prejudice to the rights conferred by the Deed of Covenant.

Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes

The Terms and Conditions

<<<

 applicable to any Definitive Note will be endorsed on that Note and will consist of the Terms and Conditions set out under "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes" below.

The Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes represented by one or more

<<<

 Global Notes will differ from those Terms and Conditions which would apply to the Notes were they in definitive form to the extent described in this "Overview o f Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form".

Each Global Note will

<<<

 contain provisions which modify the Terms and Conditions of the Notes as they apply to the relevant Global Note. The following is a summary of certain of those provisions:

<<<

 to receive payments in respect of the Notes represented by such Global Note and the Issuer will be discharged by payment to, or to the order of, the holder o f such Global Note in respect of each amount so paid. Each of the persons shown in

<<<

 the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the beneficial holder of a particular nominal amount o f the Notes represented by such Global Note must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, for his

<<<

 share of each payment so made by the Issuer to, or to the order of, the holder of such Global Note. For the purpose of any payments made in respect of a Global Note, the relevant place of presentation shall be disregarded in the definition

<<<

 of Payment Business Day set out in Condition 2.1 (Definitions).

Notices: Notwithstanding Condition 16 (Notices), while all the Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such Global Note(s) are held in their entirety on behalf of

<<<

 Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system, the requirement in Condition 16 (Notices) for a notice to be published in a leading English language daily newspaper having general circulation in London shall

<<<

 not apply and notices to Noteholders may instead be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system for communication by them to the persons shown in their respective

<<<

 records as having interests therein and, in any case, such notices shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) on the date of delivery to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any

<<<

 other relevant clearing system.

35

Extraordinary Resolutions: Notwithstanding Condition 15 (Meetings of Noteholders; Modification), while all the Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such Global Note(s) are held in their

<<<

 entirety on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system, an Extraordinary Resolution may instead be approved by Noteholders by consent given by way of electronic consents through Euroclear and

<<<

/or Clearstream Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system (in a form satisfactory to the Principal Paying Agent) by or on behalf of the holders of not less than three quarters in Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes for the

<<<

<<<

 6 and Condition 9. The first payment of interest will be made on 28th August, 2018 (the First Interest Payment Date).

5.2 Accrual of interest: Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation

<<<

, payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount in respect thereof is improperly withheld or refused, in which case it will continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition (as well after as before judgment) until whichever is the earlier

 of:(i)

<<<

 in accordance with Condition 16 that it has received all sums due in respect of the Notes up to such seventh day (except to the extent that there is any subsequent default in payment).

5.3 Interest to (but excluding) the First Call Date: Unless

<<<

 the Calculation Amount has been adjusted as described in the definition thereof, the amount of interest per Calculation Amount payable on:

<<<

<<<

 Interest Amount determined by it, together with the relevant Interest Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period, to be notified to the Paying Agents and each listing authority, stock exchange and

<<<

/or quotation system (if any) by which the Notes have then been admitted to listing, trading and/or quotation as soon as practicable after such determination but in any event not later than the relevant Reset Date. To the extent that the Principal

5.6 Calculation of amount of interest per Calculation Amount: Save as specified in Condition 5.3, the amount of interest payable in respect of the Calculation Amount

(i)

applying the applicable Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount;

(ii) multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction

<<<

; and

If pursuant to Condition 7 or as otherwise required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer, the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amounts are reduced and/or reinstated during an Interest Period, the Calculation Amount will be adjusted by the Principal Paying Agent to reflect such Outstanding Principal Amounts from time to time so that the relevant amount o f

<<<

 interest is determined by reference to such Calculation Amount as adjusted from time to time, all as determined by the Principal Paying Agent in consultation with the Issuer.

(ii) will be mandatorily cancelled, in whole or in part, to the extent:

(A) that, if the relevant payment

<<<

 were so made, the amount of such payment, when aggregated together with other distributions of the kind referred to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (or, as the case may be, any provision of Danish law transposing or implementing Article

<<<

 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive), or any other analogous provision thereto under the CRD IV requirements, would cause a breach of any regulatory restriction or prohibition on payments on Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments relating to any

<<<

 applicable Maximum Distributable Amount;

(B) otherwise so required by CRD IV, including the applicable criteria for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, or where the Relevant Regulator requires the Issuer to cancel the relevant payment in

<<<

 Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 of any such cancellation of a payment of interest, which notice might be given after the date on which the relevant payment of interest is scheduled to be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure

6.3 Effect of Interest Cancellation: Following any cancellation of interest as described above, the right of Noteholders to receive accrued

<<<

 interest in respect of any such Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are

<<<

 made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned for any purpose nor will the non-payment of such interest constitute a default by the Issuer for any purpose and the Noteholders shall have no rights in respect

<<<

 of such payment of interest whether in a bankruptcy or liquidation of the Issuer or otherwise.

Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes

7.1 Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event : If at any time a Trigger

<<<

 Event occurs, the Issuer shall immediately notify the Relevant Regulator, the Principal Paying Agent and, in accordance with Condition 16, the Noteholders and the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall be reduced as described below. Notwithstanding

<<<

 the foregoing, failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described below.

47

If a Trigger Event occurs after a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to Condition 8.2 or Condition

<<<

 8.3 but before the relevant redemption date, such notice of redemption shall automatically be revoked and the relevant redemption shall not be made until a new redemption notice is given and all conditions for redemption as described in Condition

<<<

 8.7 have been fulfilled. If a notice of a Trigger Event has been given pursuant to this Condition 7.1, no notice of redemption may be given pursuant to Condition 8.2 or Condition 8.3 until such Trigger Event has been cured. The redemption restrictions

<<<

 described in this paragraph are together referred to as the Trigger Event Early Redemption Restrictions.
Such reduction shall take place on such date selected by the Issuer in consultation with the Relevant Regulator (the Write Down Date) but

<<<

 no later than one month following the occurrence of the relevant Trigger Event.
Subject to compliance with CRD IV and BRRD requirements, the amount of the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts on the Write Down Date will be equal to

<<<

 the lower of:
(i) the amount of a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts that would restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, to at least the Trigger Event Threshold at the point of

<<<

 such reduction, taking into account the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (if any) of the Issuer and/or the Group, as the case may be, generated on or prior to the Write Down Date by the pro rata reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion

<<<

 into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of all Other Loss Absorbing AT 1 Instruments (if any) outstanding at such time,
provided that:
(x) with respect to each such Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instrument (if any

<<<

), such pro rata reduction or, as the case may be, conversion shall only be taken into account as described above to the extent required to restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, to the

<<<

 Trigger Event Threshold or, if lower, such Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instrument's trigger level; and
(y) to the extent the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount

<<<

 of any Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instrument is not, or by the relevant Write Down Date will not be, effective for any reason:
(1) the ineffectiveness of any such reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital

<<<

 instruments shall not prejudice the requirement to effect a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1; and
(2) the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments

<<<

 of, the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instrument which is not, or by the Write Down Date will not be, effective shall not be taken into account in determining such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts,
and
(ii)

<<<

 the amount of a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts that would reduce the Outstanding Principal Amounts to the Loss Absorption Minimum Amount.
If, in connection with the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts or the calculation

<<<

 of the amount of the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts, there are any Other Loss Absorbing AT 1 Instruments that may be reduced, or, as the case may be, converted into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital
48

instruments in full (save

<<<

 for any floor equivalent to the Loss Absorption Minimum Amount) but not in part only (Full Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments), then:
(I) the requirement that a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1 shall

<<<

 be effected pro rata with the reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments, as the case may be, of any Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments shall not be construed as requiring the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts to be reduced in full simply by virtue of the fact that any Full Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments will be reduced or, as the case may be, converted in full; and
(II) for the purposes of calculating the reduction of the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts, any Full Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments will be treated (for the purposes only of determining the reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments among the Notes and all Other Loss Absorbing

<<<

 AT1 Instruments on a pro rata basis) as if their terms permitted partial reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments, such that the reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital instruments of such Full Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments shall be deemed to occur in two concurrent stages:
(A) the principal amount of such Full Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments shall be reduced or converted into Common Equity

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital instruments pro rata with the Notes and all Other Loss Absorbing AT1 Instruments (if any) on the basis described in Condition 7.1 (i) above; and
(B) the balance (if any) of the principal amount of such Full Loss Absorbing AT

<<<

 1 Instruments remaining following (A) above shall be reduced or, as the case may be, converted into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments in accordance with their terms with the effect of increasing the Issuer's and/or the Group's, as the

<<<

 case may be, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio above the minimum required level under (A) above.
The Issuer's determination of the relevant amount of a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1 shall be

<<<

 binding on all parties.
Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest will continue to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amounts following such reduction, and will be subject to Condition 6 and Condition

<<<

 7.2 as described herein.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note shall, upon the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts described above, be reduced on a likewise pro rata basis.
Any reduction of the

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1 shall not constitute an event of default under the Notes.
7.2 Reinstatement of the Notes: Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts in accordance with Condition 

<<<

7.1, the Issuer may, at its discretion, reinstate some or all of the principal amount of the Notes, subject to compliance with the CRD IV requirements and the Reinstatement Limit, on a pro rata basis with all other Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing

<<<

 AT1 Instruments (if any) which would, following such reinstatement, constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital and feature similar write down and reinstatement provisions.
7.3 Reinstatement Limit: Any reinstatement of some or all of the principal

<<<

 amount of all relevant outstanding Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, where the principal amount of such Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments has been reduced, may not at any time exceed the reinstatement limit applicable at such time

<<<

 (the Reinstatement Limit). Subject to Condition 7.5, the Reinstatement Limit will be the lower of the Available Reinstatement Amounts calculated for each of the Issuer and the Group in accordance with Condition 7.4.
49

7.4 Available Reinstatement

<<<

 Amounts: The Available Reinstatement Amount for each of the Issuer and the Group will be calculated as the amount equal to the profits of (in the case of the calculation of the Issuer's Available Reinstatement Amount) the Issuer or (in the

<<<

 case of the Group's Available Reinstatement Amount) the Group, in each case after the Issuer or the Group, as the case may be, has taken a formal decision confirming its final profits, multiplied by the ratio of the Original Principal Amount

<<<

 of all relevant outstanding Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, where the principal amount of such Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments has been reduced, divided by the total Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer or the Group, as the case may be

<<<

, in each case at the date of the relevant reinstatement, less:

(1) with respect to any relevant Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, where the principal amount has been reduced, the sum of any principal amounts that have already been reinstated

<<<

 during the period to which such profits relate; and

(ii) the sum of any amounts of interest or, as the case may be, other periodic distributions in respect of any relevant Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, where the principal amount has

<<<

 been reduced, and which were paid or have been calculated (but disregarding any such interest which has been cancelled) during the period to which such profits relate on the basis of an outstanding principal amount which is lower than the Original

<<<

 Principal Amount of such Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments.

7.5 Maximum Distributable Amount restriction: A reinstatement as described above shall not be effected in circumstances which (when aggregated together with distributions of the

<<<

 kind referred to in Article 141 (2) of the CRD IV Directive or, as the case may be, any provision of Danish law transposing or implementing Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive, or any other analogous provision thereto under the CRD IV requirements

<<<

) would cause a breach of any regulatory restriction or prohibition on payments on Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments relating to any Maximum Distributable Amount.

7.6 Miscellaneous provisions applicable to reinstatement: For the avoidance

<<<

 of doubt, at no time may the Outstanding Principal Amounts exceed the Original Principal Amount of the Notes.

To the extent that the principal amount of the Notes has been reinstated as described above, interest shall begin to accrue on the

<<<

 reinstated principal amount of the Notes, and become payable in accordance with the Conditions, as from the date of the relevant reinstatement.

7.7 No liability: None of the Issuing Agent and any Paying Agent shall have any responsibility

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REVIEW
Systemically Important Financial Institutions
In June 2014, the Danish FSA appointed six

<<<

 Danish SIFIs: Danske Bank A/S (Danske), Nykredit Realkredit A/S (Nykredit), Nordea Bank Danmark A/S, Jyske Bank A/S, the Issuer and DLR Kredit A/S. The SIFIs were identified in accordance with Section 308 of the Danish Financial Business Act

<<<

. As a consequence of Nordea Bank Danmark A/S's merger with Nordea Bank AB (publ) (as the continuing entity), Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab was on 2nd January, 2017 appointed a SIFI by the Danish FSA. In June 2015, June 2016 and June

<<<

 2017, the Issuer was re-appointed as a SIFI. Institution-specific SIFI buffers (the systemic risk buffers) between 1 and 3 per cent. were set according to quantitative SIFI criteria and will be phased in gradually from 2015 to 2019. The additional

<<<

 CET1 (as defined below) requirement of the Group, beyond the requirement as per CRD IV (the SIFI buffer), was set at 1 per cent.
Danish implementation of the CRD IV Directive and CRR
In line with other European banks, Danish banks must also

<<<

 comply with the CRD IV Directive and the CRR. Both have come into force in Denmark in 2014, the CRD IV Directive through implementation of the Danish Financial Business Act, whereas the CRR applies directly without implementation in national

<<<

 law. The phase-in of the capital requirements is expected to follow the path in the CRR until 2018 unless already required under applicable Danish legislation. The CRR and CRD IV Directive framework implements, among other things, the Basel

<<<

 III reforms in the EU covering a wide range of prudential requirements, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, REA, leverage ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements. The CRD

<<<

 IV Directive covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual Pillar II risk assessment) and other measures such as the combined capital buffer requirements, SIFI definition, governance and remuneration requirements

<<<

. The EBA will propose (or in some cases, has already proposed) detailed rules through binding technical standards during the period from 2013 to 2017 for many areas including, inter alia, liquidity requirements and certain aspects of capital

<<<

 requirements.
Capital requirements
Under the CRD IV Directive and the CRR, the minimum capital requirement for Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1 or Common Equity Tier 1 Capital) will be phased in gradually to 9.5 per cent. of REA over the

<<<

 period from 2014 until 2019. The 9.5 per cent. requirement includes a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5 per cent. and a counter-cyclical buffer requirement of up to 2.5 per cent. in addition to the minimum requirement of 4.5 per

<<<

 cent. The counter-cyclical buffer requirement will apply in periods of excess lending growth in the economy and can vary for each jurisdiction. If a bank does not maintain these buffers, in excess of the 4.5 per cent. CET1 minimum requirement

<<<

, certain restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and make other payments.
For each SIFI there will be an additional CET1 capital requirement, a so-called SIFI buffer or systemic risk buffer, on top

<<<

 of the minimum requirements. The SIFI buffer is set individually on a national level according to the systemic importance of the bank. Apart from the breakdown of capital into the minimum CET1 requirement of 4.5 per cent. and the combined buffer

<<<

 requirement (capital conservation, counter-cyclical and SIFI buffer), the CRD IV Directive distinguishes between Pillar I and Pillar II capital requirements. The Pillar I capital requirement was fully implemented by 2015 and set at 8 per cent

<<<

. of REA, consisting of the minimum of 4.5 per cent. of CET1, up to 1.5 per cent. of Additional Tier 1 Capital and up to 2 per cent. of Tier 2 capital. The Pillar II requirement is the difference between an institution's individual solvency

<<<

 requirement and the 8 per cent. Pillar I requirement. In Denmark, the DFSA pile the Pillar II requirement up on top of the Pillar I requirement of 8 per cent. as a cushion below the combined buffers.
In addition to the higher capital requirements

<<<

, the CRR has a stricter criteria for determining the quality of capital that may count as Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 capital. Additional Tier 1 Capital must therefore be converted into CET1 at a trigger point of 5.125 per cent. of

<<<

 CET1, and Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 capital must have no incentive to be redeemed before the contractual maturity, which means any capital including step-up
58

structures is not accepted as Tier 2 under the CRR. Furthermore, CRR

<<<

 also implies stricter requirements for the calculation of REA. The CRR includes grandfathering rules for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments and Tier 2 instruments issued before 31st December, 2011. Any Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments

<<<

 or Tier 2 instruments issued after 31st December, 2011, which are not compliant with CRR will not be eligible for grandfathering under the CRR. The phasing out of old Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments and Tier 2 capital instruments eligible

<<<

 for grandfathering are based on a stepwise reduction of 20 per cent. in 2014 and subsequent 10 per cent. annual reductions until 2022, by which point any such capital instruments will have been completely phased out. The grandfathering bucket

<<<

 for each of the years from 2014 until 2021 is calculated based on the total nominal amount of outstanding and grandfathering compliant Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments and Tier 2 instruments as per 31st December, 2012. The CRD IV Directive

<<<

 and the CRR include a requirement for credit institutions to calculate, report and monitor their leverage ratios, defined as their Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of the sum of the exposure values of all assets and off-balance sheet items. The

<<<

 leverage ratio is a risk-neutral measure for the maximum extent of the balancesheet leverage. A high leverage ratio may cause an institution to be exposed to risks linked to sudden changes in market conditions and significant price falls on

<<<

 assets with ensuing losses. According to the CRR Amendment Proposal, the leverage ratio requirement will be set at a minimum level of 3 per cent. See further the risk factor "Impact o f regulatory changes". Liquidity requirements The NSFR is

<<<

 intended to ensure a sound funding structure by promoting an increase in long-dated funding of financial institutions. The NSFR stipulates that at all times financial institutions must have stable funding equal to the amount of their illiquid

<<<

 assets for one year ahead. The focus of the NSFR is to minimise the duration mismatch in the balance sheets of the relevant bank.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUER
INTRODUCTION
The Sydbank Group is one of Denmark's largest banking groups (according

<<<

 to the Danish Bankers Association) with assets of DKK 134.3 billion (EUR 18.0 billion) at 31st March, 2018. Sydbank has been created via a string of mergers and acquisitions, the most recent in December 2013 when Sydbank acquired DiBa Bank

<<<

 Group.
Sydbank's head office is situated in Aabenraa - a small provincial town in Southern Jutland approximately 25 kilometres north of the Danish-German border. Sydbank has 62 branches throughout Denmark and 3 in Germany. The number of branches

<<<

 is adjusted on an ongoing basis. As at 31st March, 2018, the Group had a total of 2,088 full-time employees.
Depending on customer segment and type of business, Sydbank has a market share between 6 and 13 per cent. largest within the SME segment

<<<

 (corporate clients).
THE DANISH BANKING SECTOR
The Danish banking sector is highly consolidated. The two financial conglomerates, Danske Bank and Nordea dominate the sector. Both are pan-Scandinavian banks. The two market leaders hold approximately

<<<

 67 per cent. of total loans in the Danish banking sector - Danske Bank 55 per cent. and Nordea 12 per cent. The next group of banks is Jyske Bank, with a market share of approximately 9 per cent., Nykredit Bank with a market share of approximately

<<<

 5 per cent. and Sydbank with a market share of approximately 5 per cent. Jyske Bank and Sydbank both have regional origins but have established a national brand structure. The rest of the market is fragmented with many small and medium-sized

<<<

 banks, typically with a strong local focus.
The five largest banks in Denmark have combined approximately 86 per cent. of the total loans among Danish commercial banks and savings banks.
At the end of 2016, Denmark had 78 commercial banks and

<<<

 savings banks.
Foreign banks cover only a minor - albeit rising - share of the Danish market. 28 foreign credit institutions have established branches in Denmark. In addition a few foreign banks, especially Scandinavian, have bought medium

<<<

 sized Danish banks, but kept the local brands.
Total balance sheet of the Danish-banking sector is approximately DKK 3,799 billion. This represents 30 per cent. of the overall balance sheet of the Danish financial sector, and commercial banks

<<<

 and savings banks make up one of the largest parts of the financial sector in Denmark.
The other large sector is mortgage credit, with 30 per cent. of the overall balance sheet. Nykredit and Realkredit Danmark (part of Danske Bank Group) dominate

<<<

 the mortgage credit market. Combined they hold approximately 70 per cent. of the market. Nykredit is the only remaining independent mortgage institution in Denmark. In 2003 Nykredit acquired Totalkredit (owned by over 100 small and medium sized

<<<

 banks - including Sydbank), the second largest independent mortgage institution.
Despite the relatively high concentration in the Danish banking sector, competition is fierce and effective. This is mainly due to the special Danish banking structure

<<<

, where many small and medium-sized local banks compete intensively against the few national banks. A well-developed joint infrastructure in the field of cash management characterised by solidarity has contributed to maintaining the Danish banking

<<<

 structure, distinguished by many independent units.
In addition foreign competitors trying to capture market shares intensifies competition.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SYDBANK GROUP
History
Although Sydbank's roots are more than 100 years old

<<<

, the name and legal entity, Sydbank, was first established on 15th July, 1970 (incorporated for an indefinite amount of time) through a merger of four local banks in Southern Jutland. In the 1980s, the Bank began expanding its domestic branch

<<<

 network outside Southern Jutland.
Between 1980 and 1989, the Bank established a branch in Copenhagen (in 1981), merged with Aarhus Bank (in 1983) and with Fynske Bank (in 1984) and partially acquired two Copenhagen-based banks, 6. juli Banken

<<<

 (in 1987) and Fllesbanken (in 1988). Outside Denmark, Sydbank established branches in Germany in 1984 and 1985.
In 1990, the Bank merged with Sparekassen Snderjylland, the major savings bank in Southern Jutland, which consolidated the leading

<<<

 market position of the merged entity in that area. The legal name of the merged bank was Sydbank Snderjylland A/S, organised as a subsidiary of Syd-Snderjylland Holding A/S, to comply with then applicable statutory requirements.
On 1st January

<<<

, 1994, Sydbank acquired the sound, basic banking activities of Varde Bank (which was then in financial difficulties) and, on 1st May, 1994, it acquired the basic banking activities of Aktivbanken from its insurance company parent, Topdanmark

<<<

. Following these acquisitions, Sydbank became the fourth largest bank in Denmark. The complex holding company structure was abandoned as from 1st January, 1995 and, as a result, the name of the Bank was changed to Sydbank A/S.
The purchases

<<<

 of Varde Bank's and Aktivbanken's core businesses effectively doubled the Bank's business volume as well as the number of its staff. In order to bolster its capital base following the acquisitions, the Bank made two separate issues of new share

<<<

 capital. Following the acquisitions, the Bank consciously reduced its customer base, reduced costs and made excess provisions compared with the sector in order to replenish its limited accumulated loan loss provisions. The dominating objectives

<<<

 of these measures were stabilisation and consolidation.
In early 1997, management of the Bank embarked on a series of measures aimed at growing the Bank's business in line with the rest of the Danish banking sector. Since then, operating profits

<<<

 from the acquisitions have become increasingly visible and customer departures have been replaced by customer influx. Management believes that the Bank is currently in a strong market position and has good potential of realising earnings above

<<<

 the sector average in future periods.
On 22nd August, 2000, Sydbank obtained a rating from Moody's.
In May 2002 Sydbank merged with Egnsbank Fyn, a small local bank in Odense.
On 1st April, 2007, Sydbank's third German branch opened in Kiel

<<<

. The branch is based at the acquired retail banking segment of the Kiel based bank, Bank Compagnie Nord.
In the first quarter of 2008 Sydbank acquired bankTrelleborg, a small local bank in Zealand which on 1st February, 2008 became a wholly

<<<

 owned subsidiary of the Sydbank Group and which on 27th March, 2008 merged with Sydbank with accounting effect as of 1st February, 2008.
On 1st January, 2012, Sydbank acquired the private banking activities of Gries & Heissel Bankiers AG.
As

<<<

 a consequence of the reorganisation of the Group's foreign banking activities towards year-end 2011, the subsidiary bank Sydbank (Schweiz) AG has been wound up.
On 2nd November, 2012, Sydbank acquired Tnder Bank A/S, which had approximately

<<<

 18,000 clients and a balance sheet total of around DKK 2.3 billion. As a result of the takeover Sydbank strengthened its position as the region's main bank in Southern Jutland.
61

On 19th December, 2013, Sydbank acquired DiBa Bank A/S, after

<<<

 the expiration of a tender period, which started in November when Sydbank submitted a public offer to buy all of the shares of DiBa Bank A/S for DKK 145 per share. With the acquisition of DiBa Bank, Sydbank has strengthened its presence in

<<<

 Zealand and Bornholm.
As a result the Group's bank loan and advances rose by approximately DKK 2.3 billion and deposits by approximately DKK 3.9 billion.
On 31st March, 2015 Sydbank acquired Syd Fund Management A/S for DKK 44 million, which

<<<

 is the investment management company of the investment fund Investeringsforeningen Sydinvest and several other funds.
Legal status and Group description
Sydbank A/S is a public limited liability bank, registered in the Kingdom of Denmark with

<<<

 registration number CVR No DK 1262 6509. Although there are no limitations on the transfer of shares in the Bank, individual shareholders are only permitted to vote in respect of a maximum of 20,000 shares at general meetings of the Bank.
In

<<<

 addition to the dominant banking activities of Sydbank, the Sydbank Group includes the wholly-owned undertakings Ejendomsselskabet af 1. juni 1986 A/S, DiBa A/S and Syd Fund Management A/S. The share of these undertakings of the total assets

<<<

 of the Sydbank Group is 2 per cent.
In addition, Sydbank has significant ownership interests in Bankdata (32 per cent.), the Bank's information technology support company which also provides systems solutions to 10 other Danish banks.
The Bank

<<<

's registered office and principal place of business is Peberlyk 4, DK-6200 Aabenraa, Denmark, telephone number +45 74 37 37 37.
Ownership
Sydbank is listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (www.nasdaqomxnordic.com) and has approximately 106,000 shareholders

<<<

. One shareholder - Norges Bank - has informed the Bank that it owns more than 5 per cent. of the share capital.
Business areas
The range of products the Bank offers to its customers include all normal banking and pension scheme products. Mortgage

<<<

 credit loans and insurance products are offered by several business partners and sub-suppliers of the Bank including, in the insurance area; Topdanmark, Letpension and PFA and, in the mortgage credit area, Totalkredit, Nykredit and DLR.
Sydbank

<<<

 maintains a special knowledge and competence in several niche areas, such as pensions and investments, managing payment flows and risk management for corporate clients. In the unit trust area Sydbank primarily uses Sydinvest and BankInvest

<<<

 as partners/sub-suppliers.
Sydbank is competitive within electronic banking solutions and self-service concepts. Its products in these areas include NetBank (an Internet bank), Online Banking for corporate clients and MobilBank (on smartphones

<<<

). In the autumn of 2016 Sydbank became part of the MobilePay cooperation.
Geographical location
The map below shows the location of the Bank's head office and its regional and branch offices.
62

Sydbank's customer-orientated activities in

<<<

 Denmark are handled in 9 regions which provide full service to all customers. The Danish regions are organised in corporate, private banking and retail sections to service the Bank's smaller branches. Moreover Sydbank has a separate function

<<<

 dedicated to agricultural clients. Administrative tasks are carried out by Customer Secretariats. In addition to the regional head office, a typical region has 3-11 branches and a staff of approximately 130.
The total number of branches in

<<<

 Denmark amounts to 62. The number of branches is adapted on an ongoing basis on the basis of the clients' use of them. In addition, there are three branches in Germany (one in Flensburg, one in Kiel, and one in Hamburg).
Sydbank's head office

<<<

 is situated in Aabenraa, a small provincial town approximately 25 kilometres north of the Danish-German border. This allows it to maintain a visible link with the core area in the southern part of Jutland and also reflects its historical roots

<<<

 in the area.
Vision and objectives
Sydbank is and intends to continue to be an independent nationwide Danish all-round bank operating for the benefit of its customers, local communities, shareholders and employees. Sydbank intends to have a

<<<

 decentralised structure regarding customers and a centralised structure regarding risk and cost management. Sydbank's fundamental values are based on its belief that excellence (via highly skilled employees who know their customers and their

<<<

 needs, show initiative and take responsibility) and relationships (via an open and honest dialogue with customers) create value (customers experience that being a Sydbank customer adds value and they are met by dynamic and resourceful employees

<<<

). These values are reflected in the way Sydbank services the financial needs of its customers.
In most of the 1980s and 1990s, Sydbank participated in the consolidation of small and medium- sized financial institutions in Denmark and based

<<<

 on its fundamental values, it is the Bank's ambition to participate in further consolidation of small and medium-sized financial institutions. Most recently in 2013 Sydbank participated in the consolidation when it acquired DiBa Bank.
63



<<<

The Bank's customer and product strategies are focused on servicing profitably (whether directly or through business partners and sub-suppliers) its customers' needs for finance, investment, hedging and cash management.
Maintaining the joint

<<<

 Danish payment systems - interbank and securities exchange and settlement systems - is one important element of Sydbank's strategy. This is underlined by the Bank's participation in the National Banks in Denmark (LDB), which is a private organisation

<<<

 for banks. The members of LDB are Arbejdernes Landsbank A/S, Nykredit Bank A/S, Spar Nord Bank A/S and Sydbank A/S.
The Bank's investment in the information technology area is undertaken both through active participation in the joint Danish

<<<

 payment systems and partly through its participation with 10 other Danish financial institutions in Bankdata, which develops basic information technology systems for financial institutions. Bankdata has an operating agreement with JN Data in

<<<

 Silkeborg.
Goals and competitive parameters
Sydbank intends to increase its market share primarily in earnings, but also in business volume and customers. The Bank aims to attract more customers in both the youth and senior segments. Closeness

<<<

 and availability are key competitive parameters for Sydbank in seeking to increase its market share. The Bank aims to ensure that using Sydbank should be a straightforward experience to the customers.
In this connection, Sydbank intends to

<<<

 develop and improve the efficiency of its delivery channels targeted at corporate and retail customers in order to meet their wish for increased availability and in order to increase the degree of self-service thus making time available for

<<<

 advisory customer services.
Sydbank wishes to give its clients the possibility of contacting the Bank when it is convenient for them. Therefore Sydbank has three customer service centres with telephone openings hours all week between 8am and

<<<

 8pm, except for a few bank holidays.
Sydbank aims to be able to maintain strong long-term relationships with clients. In 2015 the Bank launched Sydbank Favorit, a loyalty programme for retail clients. Sydbank Favorit is based on up to 10 optional

<<<

 benefits while at the same time rewarding clients for loyalty and long-term relationships with the Bank through a number of discounts.
The Bank will continue to attach great importance to offering personal service to its customers. Therefore

<<<

, the Bank will maintain a relatively large low-cost branch network through the use of both part-time and small branches (with only 2-4 employees). At the same time, the Bank aims to expand its electronic customer channels including the use

<<<

 of card systems and machines and online banking systems. IT is an essential part of the Bank's business model. Sydbank sees technology as a means to bring the Bank closer to clients and reduce complexity thus creating a simple and seamless

<<<

 customer experience. The Bank's business model is adapted regularly to meet clients' increasing demand for self-service and advisory services outside the traditional branch. Sydbank works closely with Bankdata on the development of new IT systems

<<<

. The focus is on the digitisation of processes, creating a better online customer experience and even better capital market systems. These strategic issues will be of great significance in 2018 and onward.
Customer satisfaction
Sydbank considers

<<<

 a high degree of customer satisfaction to be an important competitive parameter. Management believes that its retail and corporate customers (particularly in its core areas) have a high degree of loyalty and that they are generally satisfied

<<<

 with the Bank.
Sydbank's objective is to maintain a top 3 ranking among the 6 largest banks in terms of customer satisfaction.
The 2017 Aalund Research poll shows that Sydbank is ranked fourth with respect to satisfaction and loyalty of corporate

<<<

 clients among the largest banks in the sector.
The annual EPSI poll of retail clients' satisfaction with their bank showed that Sydbank is ranked fifth among the largest Danish Banks.
64

Cash management
Domestic cash management is centred

<<<

 in Nets - one of the cornerstones of the joint Danish payment systems. Like other Danish banks, Sydbank issues debit cards to its customers through Dankort. The Dankort card can be combined with Visa and, as such, it can also be used abroad

<<<

. Sydbank has issued more than 272,000 Visa/Dankort cards, equal to a market share of approximately five per cent. The Visa/Dankort card can be used as a purchase card at 84,000 points-of-sale in Denmark and for making withdrawals in approximately

<<<

 2,300 ATMs in Denmark.
Sydbank also offers a versatile MasterCard credit card programme as well as a MasterCard debit card. At the end of January 2018 Sydbank MasterCard credit cards in circulation numbered more than 60,000. The debit card

<<<

 was issued to more than 135,000 clients. Sydbank MasterCards are delivered through Nets.
Sydbank's activities in its branches in Northern Germany are aimed at small and medium-sized businesses and at retail customers. The corporate activities

<<<

 are concentrated around cash management and small transaction credits. The Bank has generated considerable expertise and experience within cash management between Denmark and Germany, which makes it an attractive business partner to Danish

<<<

 businesses with activities in Germany. In addition, Sydbank participates in the German MultiCash system. MultiCash is an online banking system developed for cash management by a joint group of German banks.
In 1999, Sydbank joined the international

<<<

 Connector Partnership for efficient cross-border cash management. The partnership represents an overall branch network of approximately 25,000. The agreement has resulted in significantly improved competitiveness within international cash management

<<<

 and, through this partnership, Sydbank is able to match the offers of larger financial institutions.
Sydbank also participates in the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA).
Risk Management
The overall risk management is supported by individual risk

<<<

 committees that report directly to the Group Executive Management. The risk committees identify, monitor and assess risks within the individual risk areas and ensure that models and principles are formulated to calculate risk. Committees have

<<<

 been set up for each of the risk areas: credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk as well as IT Security. The committees ensure that the Bank's business units proactively carry out their operations to counter identified

<<<

 risks. The Groups Chief Risk Officer (the CRO) is a member of all risk committees. The committees consist of a Group Executive Management member (chairman), the CRO and a broad composition of other members.
The committees meet as a minimum

<<<

 every quarter and prepare as a minimum once a year a risk analysis which is used in connection with the annual overall risk assessment of the Group.
Sydbank Markets and investment centres
Sydbank believes that investments will continue to be

<<<

 a high-growth area in the years ahead as a consequence of increasing pension savings, outsourcing of asset management and continued increasing demand from personal investors for investment products.
As a result, the Bank intends to continue

<<<

 to focus on asset management and securities trading. One important competitive parameter will be its ability to provide an expert and value-adding advisory service. Internet technology is expected to play an important role in this service and

<<<

 Sydbank offers its customers the opportunity to buy and sell a number of Danish and foreign shares and bonds at real time prices via NetBank.
In the area of retail customers, Sydbank's objective is to offer decentralised advisory services in

<<<

 local investment centres. The local investment centres are an integrated part of the private banking organization. There is a physical private banking centre in each of the Bank's 9 regions. This highlights the personal service and ensures

<<<

 the opportunity of tailoring investment solutions to the individual customer's needs.
Asset Management undertakes traditional asset management responsibilities, such as the management of the Bank's pooled pension plans and individual portfolio

<<<

 management mandates.

As at 31st March, 2018, the accumulated impairment ratio

<<<

 was 4.0 per cent. Sydbank has approximately 480,000 clients.
Lending and credit policy

The Bank seeks to manage its credit risk centrally with all credit approvals being subject to close supervision and a clearly defined approval process.

<<<

 In order to ensure this close supervision, written guidelines by way of an overall credit policy and a detailed procedures manual have been prepared.
The Credit Committee is responsible for credits and the General Manager and Assistant General

<<<

 Manager of credits, is responsible for all issues regarding credits and procedures manuals.
Credit risk models
The Group is continuously working to further develop the classification and rating models that are applied to evaluate and classify

<<<

 existing as well as potential retail and corporate exposures.
Model development is based on the recommendations submitted by the Basel Committee on the internal ratings based approach to specialised lending exposures.
With regard to retail

<<<

 exposures, the Group uses the advanced IRB approach under which the Group estimates the probability of default (PD), loss given defaults (LGD) and the utilisation of credit facilities (CF). With regard to corporate exposures the Group uses

<<<

 the foundation IRB approach under which the Group estimates only PD and not LGD and CF.
At year-end 2016 a project was launched with the objective of gaining approval to apply the advanced IRB approach with regard to corporate exposures in

Supervision

<<<



In addition to the Bank's Internal Audit Department, the quality of the credit portfolio is monitored by Risk Follow-Up, a department organised under the Bank's Risk Department. Risk Follow-up monitors the credit quality analyses of the Group

<<<

's new exposures as well as regular random sampling of the retail and corporate client portfolios. The controllers of the Risk Department also supervise the documentary quality, perfection of security, registrations and administrative procedure

<<<

 manuals of the Bank.

Industry diversification

According to the Bank's credit policy, the Bank's corporate credit portfolio should reflect the commercial structure in the society and the individual industries. However, the composition of the

<<<

 portfolio should not deviate significantly from the industry spread of the financial institutions similar to the Bank.

The Bank's Credit Department continuously monitors the development of individual industries and re-evaluates once a year

<<<

 the limits of the Bank's total credit to the most significant types of industries.

Consolidation and large exposures

Exposures with inter-connected customers are considered as one. According to the Bank's credit policy, the Bank does not

<<<

 wish to depend on individual, large customers. Therefore, it has been decided that the 10 largest exposures (consolidated) should not exceed a maximum of 10 per cent. of the total credit portfolio.

Credit loss

Large exposures are continuously

<<<

 evaluated with a view to assessing the impairment charges needed. Individual impairment charges taken on minor exposures are supplemented with grouped impairment charges.

Sources o ffunds

<<<

 laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in the preceding sentence have the meanings given to them

<<<

 by Regulation S under the Securities Act.

The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or its possessions or to U.S. persons, except in certain transactions permitted

TAXATION
Persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition o f the Notes should consult their own tax advisers concerning the tax consequences in the light o f their particular situations

<<<

. No representations with respect to the tax consequences o f any particular Noteholder are made hereby.
Kingdom of Denmark
The following is a summary description o f the taxation in Denmark o f the Notes according to the Danish tax laws in

<<<

 force at the date hereof and is subject to any changes in law and the interpretation and application thereof, which changes could be made with retroactive effect. The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description o f

<<<

 all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, hold or dispose o f the Notes, and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories o f investors, some o f which (such as professional

<<<

 dealers in securities) may be subject to special rules. Potential investors are under all circumstances strongly recommended to contact their own tax adviser to clarify the individual consequences o f their investment, holding and disposal

<<<

 o f the Notes. The Issuer makes no representations regarding the tax consequences ofpurchase, holding or disposal o f the Notes.
Taxation at source
Under existing Danish tax laws, no general withholding tax or coupon tax will apply to payments

<<<

 of interest or principal or other amounts due on the Notes, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to in The Danish Corporation Tax Act (Selskabsskatteloven), Consolidated

<<<

 Act No. 1164 of 6th September, 2016, as amended from time to time. This will not have any impact on Noteholders who are not in a relationship whereby they control, or are controlled by, the Issuer, or where the Noteholders and the Issuer are

<<<

 not controlled by the same group of shareholders.
Resident Noteholders
Private individuals, including persons who are engaged in financial trade, companies and similar enterprises resident in Denmark for tax purposes or receiving interest on

<<<

 the Notes through their permanent establishment in Denmark are liable to pay tax on such interest.
Capital gains are taxable to individuals and corporate entities in accordance with the Danish Capital and Exchange Gains Act (Kursgevinstloven

<<<

), Consolidated Act No. 1283 of 25th October, 2016, as amended from time to time. Gains and losses on Notes held by corporate entities are generally taxed in accordance with a mark-to-market principle (lagerprincippet), i.e. on an unrealised

<<<

 basis.
Gains and losses on Notes issued to individuals are generally taxed on a realised basis. The net gains are taxed as capital income at a rate of up to 42 per cent. in 2017. However, this tax rate does not apply if the individual is engaged

<<<

 in financial trade and considered a professional trader. The gain or loss will only be included in the taxable income when the net gain or loss for the year on all debt claims, debt denominated in foreign currency and investment certificates

<<<

 in bond-based investment funds subject to the minimum taxation exceeds a total of DKK 2,000.
A variety of features regarding interest and principal may apply to the Notes. The applicable taxation of capital gains to corporate entities or individuals

<<<

 will depend on the features applicable to the Notes in question.
Non-Resident Noteholders
Under existing Danish tax laws, payments of interest or principal amounts to any non-resident Noteholder are not subject to taxation in Denmark, other

<<<

 than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to under "Taxation at source" above. Thus no Danish withholding tax will be payable with respect to such payments and any capital gain realised

<<<

 upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note will not be subject to taxation in Denmark, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to under "Taxation at source" above.
75

<<<



This tax treatment applies solely to Noteholders who are not subject to full tax liability in Denmark or included in a Danish joint taxation scheme and do not carry on business in Denmark through a permanent establishment.
U.S. Foreign Account

<<<

 Tax Compliance Act Withholding
Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA, a "foreign financial institution" may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (foreign passthru payments

<<<

) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related requirements. The Issuer is a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including Denmark) have entered into, or have agreed in substance

<<<

 to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (IGAs), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an

<<<

 IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding

<<<

 would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments

<<<

 on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to 1st January, 2019. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.
The proposed financial transactions

<<<

 tax (FTT)
On 14th February, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the Commission's Proposal) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia (together,

<<<

 the participating Member States) and Estonia. However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary

<<<

 market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) 9 Regulation (EC) No. 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt.
Under the Commission's Proposal, FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons

<<<

 both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A

<<<

 financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial

<<<

 instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the

<<<

 timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

There

<<<

<<<

, 2017 and 31st December, 2016 have, in each case, been audited by Ernst & Young P/S (EY). EY is a member of "FSR- Danske Revisorer" (Association of State Authorised Public Accountants).

<<<

 by such third parties no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. The source of third party information is identified where used.
Joint Lead Managers transacting with the Issuer
Some of

<<<

 the Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of

<<<

 business. Some of the Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may have positions, deal or make markets in the Notes, related derivatives and reference obligations, including (but not limited to) entering into hedging strategies on behalf of

<<<

 the Issuer and its affiliates, investor clients, or as principal in order to manage their exposure, their general market risk, or other trading activities.
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Joint Lead Managers

<<<

 and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts

<<<

 of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuer's affiliates. Certain of the Joint Lead Managers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with

<<<

 the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which

<<<

 consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Joint Lead Managers

<<<

 and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short

<<<

 positions in such securities and instruments.
