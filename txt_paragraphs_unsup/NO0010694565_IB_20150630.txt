PRESS RELEASE
WWS AS - DELAY OF SHARE TRANSFER IN THE

<<<

 LIMITED PARTNER B V s
Reference is made to the notice on April 22, 2015 regarding the share transfer in the Limited Partner BVs. Damen is still discussing the transfer of Limited Partners Shares to WWS with the Dutch tax authorities. A next

<<<

 meeting is scheduled on July 8, 2015. Furthermore, Damen has also stated that they have no obligation to sell and transfer the Limited Partner Shares to WWS before the Tax Review has been concluded and the ADS (accelerated depreciation schemes

<<<

) fully applied by Damen.
WWS has sent a letter to Damen holding Damen liable for all possible damages of WWS resulting from a potential breach of Damen and has reserved the right to take further action. WWS believes it has a strong case against

<<<

 Damen, but due to the ongoing Tax Review it is uncertain when a completion of the share transfer can take place. WWS has still the view that the delay in the transfer of the shares in the Limited Partner BVs will not have any financial implications

<<<

 for World Wide Supply AS and will not affect the price for the shares based on agreed and approved principles.
