General Information: Polarcus Ltd. (the "Company" or "Polarcus

<<<

"), a Cayman Islands limited liability company, is currently in the process of restructuring its balance sheet as described in the summons for bondholder's meetings with annexes, dated 6 January 2016 (the "Summons"). As part of the restructuring

<<<

, the bondholders in the Company's bond issues with ISIN NO 001 0680150, ISIN NO 001 0714389 and ISIN NO 001 0607435 (the "Existing Bonds") are asked to make an election between the two following solutions for their Existing Bonds (where bondholders

<<<

 can choose the split they desire as set out below):

Alternative A

Accept a reduction to the call option prices for its Existing Bonds and other amendments described in Annex B to the Summons. The bonds under Alternative A will continue to

<<<

 exist under the existing ISIN for the relevant Existing Bonds, but will be separated into new tranches referred to as the "Unsecured A Tranches" and the "CB Tranche B1" respectively. Bondholders who do not make an election for their bonds will

<<<

 continue to hold their Existing Bonds on the amended terms for Alternative A.

Alternative B

Subscribe for new Class B-shares in the Company with nominal value USD 0.0013 per share (the "New Shares") at a subscription price of USD 0.0013 per

<<<

 share for bonds denominated in USD and NOK 0.0115 per share for bonds denominated in NOK. The New Shares will be settled against set off of approximately 0.5% of the par value of the Existing Bonds while the remainder approximately 99.5% of

<<<

 the par value of Existing Bonds will be converted into bonds in new tranches with reduced call option prices and other amendments as described in Annex B to the Summons. The tranches under Alternative B (such tranches referred to as the "Unsecured

<<<

 B Tranches and the "CB Tranche B2" respectively) will have call option prices below the tranches under Alternative A.

The Class B-shares are equal to the ordinary shares of the Company, apart from the nominal value. The bonds allocated to

<<<

 Alternative A are referred to as the Existing Bonds, but will be subject to amended terms as set out under Alternative A. The bonds offered in Alternative B are referred to as the "New Bonds". The primary difference between the Existing Bonds

<<<

 and the New Bonds is that the Existing Bonds will have higher interest payments and call price levels than the New Bonds, cf. Annex B to the Summons for further details on the respective bond tranches. The New Shares, the Existing Bonds and

<<<

 the New Bonds are jointly referred to as the "Securities". The Company will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Securities are listed on Oslo Stock Exchange or (as the case may be) Oslo Axess as soon as possible after having been

<<<

 issued and registered in relevant registers.
The Securities are offered through a private placement (the "Private Placement") directed towards (a) the bondholders of the initial Existing Bonds registered with the Norwegian Central Securities

<<<

 Depository ("VPS") at the commencement of the Application Period (as defined below) (the "Initial Bondholders") as well as (b) any purchaser of Existing Bonds being recorded in the VPS in the Application Period ("Subsequent Bondholders") however

<<<

 limited to a total number of 149 investors in each jurisdiction, with priority for the Initial Bondholders. Any Subsequent Bondholders not qualifying for the Private Placement will be allocated bonds under Alternative A for all their Existing

<<<

 Bonds. Certain key shareholders will launch a voluntary share purchase offer (the "Program") of New Shares subscribed by bondholders in connection with the Private Placement. The Program will be in an amount of up to USD 4.5 million, but in

<<<

 any event limited to an aggregate purchase amount that will ensure that the shares held and acquired by the offeror(s) do not place it in a mandatory offer situation under applicable rules. Further details on the Program are set out in the

<<<

 specification of application below.
The Private Placement is carried out subject to applicable exemptions from relevant prospectus requirements, in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as

<<<

 amended (the "US Securities Act") (to the extent available) and outside the United States in compliance with Rule 903 or Rule 904, as applicable, of Regulation S under the US Securities Act, and the exemptions available under the EU Prospectus

<<<

 Directive as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area ("EEA").
Polarcus has appointed ABG Sundal Collier ASA as Manager (the "Manager") in the Private Placement.

<<<

<<<

 the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer, and that the Securities are offered under available exemptions including Regulation S and Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (where applicable).
The Company agrees

<<<

 that for as long as any of the New Shares being offered and sold pursuant to the Private Placement remain outstanding and are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities Act, if at any time the Company

<<<

 is neither subject to Section 13 or Section 15(d) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "U.S. Exchange Act"), nor exempt from reporting under the U.S. Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder, the Company

<<<

 written request of any such shareholder.
Canada: The distribution of the Securities in Canada is being made only on a private-placement basis, thus exempting it from the requirement that the Company prepare and file a prospectus with the applicable

<<<

 securities regulatory authorities. The Securities are being offered in those jurisdictions and to those persons where and to whom they may lawfully be offered for sale, and therein only by persons permitted to sell such securities. Each Canadian

<<<

 purchaser who purchases Securities must be entitled under applicable securities laws to purchase such securities without the benefit of a prospectus qualified under such securities laws; must be an "accredited investor" within the meaning of

<<<

 National Instrument 45-106 - Prospectus and Registration Exemptions and purchasing the Securities as principal or deemed principal for its own account; and must be a "permitted client" within the meaning of National Instrument 31-103 - Registration

<<<

 Requirements and Exemptions. There is currently no public market for the Securities in Canada and any resale of the Securities in Canada must be made in accordance with applicable securities laws.

<<<

 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (all such persons being referred to as "relevant persons") and (b) only in circumstances where, in accordance with section 86(1)(c) and (d) of the Financial

<<<

<<<

 Applicant, but which a Manager will not have access to in its capacity as Manager for the Private Placement. The Manager is further part of a securities firm that offers a broad range of investment services. In order to ensure that assignments

<<<

 undertaken in certain departments are kept confidential, the other activities, including analysis and stock broking, are separated from the respective departments by information walls. The Applicant acknowledges that the analysis and stock

<<<

 broking activity within the securities firm may conflict with the Applicant's interests with regard to transactions in the Securities as a consequence of such information walls.
Mandatory anti-money laundering procedures: The Private Placement

<<<

 is subject to the Norwegian Money Laundering Act No. 11 of 6 March 2009 and the Norwegian Money Laundering Regulations No. 302 of 13 March 2009 (collectively the "Anti Money Laundering Legislation"). Applicants who are not registered as existing

<<<

 customers of a Manager must verify their identity to the Manager in accordance with requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering Legislation, unless an exemption is available. Applicants who have designated an existing Norwegian bank account and

<<<

 herein for completion of the Private Placement. The execution and delivery of the Application Agreement has been authorized by all necessary action by the Applicant or on the Applicant's behalf, and the Application Agreement represents valid

<<<

 and binding obligations, enforceable against the Applicant in accordance with its terms. The Applicant bears the full risk for its legal ability to apply for, subscribe, purchase and own the relevant Securities in the Company, and its monetary

<<<

 liability under this undertaking will not cease to be effective in the event that its subscription and ownership would be illegal due to applicable statutory law and regulations.
Limitation of liability: The Manager hereby, to the fullest extent

<<<

 permissible under applicable law, expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever towards the Applicant in connection with the Private Placement and the Applicant understands and

ABG - Application Agreement - Private Placement January 2016
expressly

<<<

 agrees that it is applying for and subscribing Securities on this basis. The Manager makes no undertaking, representation or warranty, express or implied, to the Applicant regarding the accuracy or completeness of the Investor Documentation

<<<

 and any other information (whether written or oral), concerning the Company, the Securities or the Private Placement received by the Applicant whether such information was received through the Manager or otherwise, and the Applicant acknowledges

<<<

 by the Applicant's application that the Applicant has not been induced to enter into this Application Agreement by any representation, warranty or undertaking by any of the aforementioned.

<<<

 Agreement, and no rule of Norwegian law that would result in the application of foreign law on this Application Agreement shall be applied. Any disputes regarding this Application Agreement which cannot be solved amicably, shall be referred

<<<

 to the exclusive jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Norway to settle any dispute or claim of any kind (whether contractual, in tort or otherwise) and the Applicant accepts the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Oslo District Court. Any party
