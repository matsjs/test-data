Results and main developments fo r the year ended December 31, 2013
Fourth quarter results The net profit after

<<<

 tax for the year ended December 31, 2013 was U.S.$34.6 million compared to a profit of U.S.$60.4 million for the year ended December 31,2012. EBITDA for the year ended December 31,2013 was U.S.$216.2 million compared to U.S.$213.4 million for

<<<

 the year ended December 31,2012. The financial results for the fourth quarter 2013 were mainly impacted by the following:
The SPM division generated U.S.$12.3 million EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2013, resulting in U.S.$38.1 million EBITDA

<<<

 for the year ended December 31,2013 compared to U.S.$51.7 million EBITDA for the year ended December 31,2012. The 2013 SPM results were driven by ongoing projects that started during 2011 and 2012 that have been substantially completed during

<<<

 2013.
The fourth quarter EBITDA for the FPSO division was U.S.$65.0 million, resulting in EBITDA for the FPSO division for the year ended December 31,2013 of U.S.$191.9 million compared to U.S.$162.0 million for the year ended December 31,

<<<

2012.
The U.S.$29.9 increase in EBITDA compared to the year ended December 31,2012 was mainly driven by a U.S.$47.3 million EBITDA improvement for the FPSO Haewene Brim, which suffered a U.S.$7.4 million loss during the year ended December 

<<<

31,2012 compared to a U.S.$39.9 million profit during the year ended December 31,2013. This large fluctuation in EBITDA was largely due to U.S.$25.7 million costs included in the 2012 result in relation to mooring leg repairs, whilst 2013 EBITDA

<<<

 includes a cost reimbursement for the same amount, due from our insurers and client. This EBITDA improvement for the Haewene Brim is partially offset by costs of maintenance work that was performed during the period the vessel was in the yard

<<<

 in Scotland, but was unrelated to the preparation for the Brynhild field. The FPSO Haewene Brim left the yard on November 9, 2013 and has been back on location since November 16, 2013. Work is ongoing to prepare the vessel for recommencement

<<<

 of production of the Pierce field and start-up of the Brynhild field. The costs related to the modification and life time extension work to prepare the vessel for tie-in and production of the Brynhild field are fully reimbursed by the Brynhild

<<<

 field owners. During the year ended December 31, 2013, such costs, amounting to US$220.9 million, have been capitalized and related revenues have been deferred, resulting in nil impact on EBITDA. Income will be recognized once oil production

<<<

 on the Brynhild field commences and will be offset by depreciation of the capitalized costs. EBITDA of the FPSO Aoka Mizu decreased by U.S.$4.2 million due to declining field production and EBITDA of the FPSO Glas Dowr decreased by U.S.$2.

<<<

4 million, mainly due to lower production and repair costs following a steam engine failure. Finally, EBITDA for the year ended December 31,2012 included U.S.$12.4 million gain on the sale of the FPSO Uisge Gorm. The remaining U.S.$1.6 million

<<<

 EBITDA improvement is mainly caused by lower lay-up costs of the FPSO Munin during the year ended December 31,2013.
Overhead costs for the year ended December 31,2013 were U.S.$13.8 million versus U.S.$0.3 million for the year ended December

<<<

 31,2012. The increase in overhead costs was partly due to a reduced workload of the engineering organization compared to the previous year. Additionally, the average Euro-Dollar exchange rate was higher during the year ended December 31,20

<<<

13 compared to the year ended December 31,2012, which caused increased Euro denominated overhead costs.
Depreciation expenditure was at the same level compared to the year ended December 31,2012, at U.S.$91.7 million versus U.S.$91.6 million

<<<

.
Finance expenses were U.S.$13.1 million higher compared to the previous year, at U.S.$75.4 million versus U.S.$62.3 million in the year ended December 31,2012. Finance expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes U.S.$14.5 million

<<<

 of non-recurring costs in relation to the refinancing of the Glas Dowr project financing, amendments of the corporate facility and refinancing of the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond. These
2

non-recurring costs included U.S.$3.6 million amortization

<<<

 of remaining capitalized costs related to the Glas Dowr project financing, that were reclassified to the income statement upon the refinancing, U.S.$3.6 million bond redemption costs in relation to the repayment of the U.S.$360 million unsecured

<<<

 bond loan, U.S.$0.5 million amortization of remaining capitalized costs in relation to the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond and U.S.$6.8 million in relation to the interest rate swap on this unsecured bond loan that rendered ineffective upon

<<<

 refinancing and was therefore transferred to the income statement. Additionally, U.S.$2.3 million interest was accrued on the new U.S.$400 million bond loan, whilst interest on the U.S.$360 million bond loan continued. Apart from these costs

<<<

 related to the refinancing, interest costs decreased by U.S.$3.7 million during the year ended December 31,2013 compared to the previous year following a significant reduction in net debt, resulting from steady operating cash flow.
Currency

<<<

 exchange results were U.S.$3.1 million positive in the year ended December 31,2013 compared to U.S.$1.0 million positive in the year ended December 31,2012. The currency exchange results relate mainly to the fluctuation in the fair value of

<<<

 forward currency contracts.
Income tax expenses were U.S.$17.7 million in the year ended December 31,2013 compared to U.S.$0.2 million in the year ended December 31,2012. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31,2013 includes a U.S

<<<

.$7.9 million reduction of the deferred tax, U.S.$6.8 million withholding tax incurred in relation to the Glas Dowr revenues and U.S.$3,0 million of other foreign taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31,2012 includes U.S.$7

<<<

.1 million in relation to withholding tax incurred in relation to the Glas Dowr revenues, a tax gain of U.S.$7.0 million in relation to deferred tax and U.S.$0.1 million other tax expenses.
Other developments Effective May 28, 2013, the Company

<<<

 entered into a U.S.$415.0 million Senior Secured Project Finance Facility. Additionally, effective May 28, 2013, the Company entered into a U.S.$102.5 million Amended Revolving Credit Facility, consisting of a U.S.$52.5 million term loan and

<<<

 a U.S.$50.0 million working capital facility. The proceeds of both facilities have been used to repay the Glas Dowr project financing facility and to reduce the amount outstanding under the existing corporate facility.
Interest on the U.S.

<<<

$415.0 million project finance facility is 3-months USD Libor plus 4% margin per annum and the maturity date is March 31,2019. This facility reduces on a quarterly basis with the net proceeds generated by the FPSO Haewene Brim and FPSO Glas

<<<

 Dowr. Fees amounting to U.S.$10.8 million have been accounted for as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the loan and are amortized over the term of the facility. To mitigate the interest exposure on this facility, the Company entered into

<<<

 a floating to fixed interest rate swap, thereby fixing the interest on the facility including margin at 4.9125%. The interest rate swap is effective starting August 28, 2013 until February 28, 2018.
Effective December 10, 2013, the Company

<<<

 entered into a further amendment of the Revolving Credit Facility. This further amendment includes an increased facility amount of U.S.$120 million and interest at 3-months USD Libor plus 3% margin per annum with final repayment ultimately

<<<

 on March 31,2017. Total fees in relation to the revisions to the Revolving Credit Facility amounting to U.S.$2.1 million have been accounted for as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the loan and are amortized over the term of the facility

<<<

.
Effective December 10, 2013, the Company issued a U.S.$400 million unsecured bond with a fixed interest rate of 10% per year and a maturity date of December 10, 2019. On the same date the existing U.S.$360 million unsecured bond loan was called

<<<

 and redemption of this loan took place on January 27, 2014. The proceeds of the new U.S.$400 million bond were used to repay the existing U.S.$360 million bond loan plus early redemption costs of U.S.$3.6 million, debt arrangement fees of U

<<<

.S.$10.9 million and initial funding of a debt service reserve account amounting to of U.S.$3.3 million. The remaining proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the new U.S.$400 million bond

<<<

 loan, a debt service account will be built up to a maximum of U.S.$20 million, over a period of 6 months.

General information Aurelia Energy N.V. (the "Company") is the holding company of the Bluewater group (Bluewater), a specialized service

<<<

 provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates floating production storage and offloading units ("FPSOs"), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops, performs

<<<

 project management and constructs single point mooring systems ("SPMs"). An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either newly built

<<<

 or converted tankers upon which production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and water) are processed onboard the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported to an off take system utilizing shuttle tankers

<<<

. Bluewater's fleet of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- and long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts. SPMs

<<<

 are used to transfer fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker while securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. Most SPMs consist of an anchoring system that is connected to the

<<<

 ocean floor and a fluid transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids between fixed and rotating parts of the mooring system. SPMs are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors. Revenues are earned from day

<<<

 rates consisting of a fixed facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases with oil companies, supplemented from time to time with fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned

<<<

 on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed. FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial design and

<<<

 engineering phase to final installation. Further, Bluewater engages subcontractors in the fabrication of FPSOs, SPMs and auxiliary equipment.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Reporting entity Aurelia Energy N.V. (the "Company") has its legal seat in Willemstad 

<<<

(Curasao). The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the period ended December 31,2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as "the Group" or "Bluewater" and individually

<<<

 as "Group entities") and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities.
Statement of compliance The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International

<<<

 Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements.
Basis of preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, which is the

<<<

 Company's functional currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with the

<<<

 recognition and measurement criteria of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements. The information furnished in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements

<<<

 includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of such financial statements. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make

<<<

 the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December

<<<

 31,2012.
The preparation of these interim financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and

<<<

 expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future

<<<

 periods affected.
In particular, significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are:
 Revenue

<<<

 recognition on construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned with the leased facilities;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried

<<<

 forward;  Potential impact of claims and litigation.
1. Segment information
The disclosure of segment information is consistent with the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each

<<<

 segment's performance and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments since the Company's risks and rates of return are affected primarily by differences in services and products produced.
Segment

<<<

 results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly employee benefits expense, head office expenses, investments and

<<<

 related revenue and income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues.
