, 9 February 2015
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING
Nordic Trustee ASA (previously Norsk Tillitsmann ASA) acts as trustee (the "Bond Trustee") for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above bond issue (the "Bonds", the "Bond Issue" or "IMSK

<<<

12") with I.M. Skaugen SE as issuer (the "Company" or the "Issuer").
Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement (as amended) dated 21 February 2012 (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated

<<<

 herein.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND
The Company's core operating

<<<

 market for petchem/LPG and LNG transport has been challenging since the financial crisis, and operating results and cash flow have been reflective of this. At the same time, the Company is now seeing encouraging signs of improvement. Earnings

<<<

 from vessel operations improved notably through 2014, apart from a short term dip in the fourth quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter dip was a result of rapid decline in oil prices and product prices creating a wait and see for product purchases

<<<

. The positive trend is expected to continue in 2015 on the back of a number of positive factors derived from the US shale oil and gas boom and a lower oil price. The Company is also engaged in concrete and advanced discussions regarding TC

<<<

-contracts for LNG freight for its LNG capable vessels (6 vessels in total).
The IMSK12 Bond Issue is maturing on 27 February 2015, and currently NOK 209 million (approx. USD 27.5 million) is outstanding (net of current Issuer's Bonds). To ensure

<<<

 sufficient working capital going forward, the Issuer is aiming to reduce the direct liquidity impact from the February maturity through a proposal to the Bondholders by (i) extension of the remaining outstanding principal to 30 June 2016 (ii

<<<

) a part buy back offer of minimum NOK 60 million (equivalent of USD 8 million) of principal amount.
The proposal is approved by the Board of Directors of I.M. Skaugen SE.
As part of the transaction, the Company has received and accepted an

<<<

 indicative term sheet to roll forward a USD/NOK cross currency swap against security, which will mature at the same time as the extended bond and where Swedbank is the swap counterparty. The cross currency swap is part of the company's portfolio

<<<

 of derivatives securing a constant USD nominal on the bond debt. This part of the transaction will have no liquidity effect nor any material P&L effect and the swap itself and its current underlying negative value will be secured by a 2nd priority

<<<

 lien in two of the Company's owned vessels. In the group profit and loss statement this negative value is offset by gains on the nominal value of the bonds in USD. The Proposal is subject to approval by

 committee ahead of the Bondholder's Meeting.
