USD 225,000,000 SENIOR SECURD CALLABLE BOND ISSUE 2010/2017

We refer to the loan agreement

<<<

 dated 14 May 2010 related to the above bond issue with SKDP 1 Ltd as Issuer (the "Loan Agreement"), and terms defined therein shall have the same meaning when used in this letter.

The Rig is now scheduled to be delivered on 29 September 2

<<<

010. We will inform you of any change in this date as soon as we have any new information. We will work with you and your lawyers in order to satisfy all condition precedent requirements in order to utilize the funds on the Escrow Account to

<<<

 make the delivery instalment to the Yard.

We do not expect to be able to secure an Operational Contract for the Rig before delivery, and will in such case repay USD 25,000,000 of the Bonds on the Delivery Date by release from the Escrow Account

<<<

.

Please also take notice that we expect to carry out a sale of the Rig, or a sale of the shares in SKDP 1 Ltd (in either case the "Expected Transaction") in connection with a reorganisation of the ownership of the Rig. The Expected Transaction

<<<

 will constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event, and we will make a prepayment and redeem the Outstanding Bonds upon its completion in accordance with Clause 10.4.1 of the Loan Agreement.

Please consider this letter as the notice required under

<<<

 Clause 10.4.2 of the Loan Agreement to be given "at least thirty days prior to the settlement date of any mandatory redemption". We will inform you about the exact date later, and it is expected to be on the later of 30 Business Days from the

<<<

 date hereof, or two business days after the Delivery Date.

Rowan Companies Inc. is today the owner of 97.06 % of the shares of Skeie Drilling & Production ASA, and the reorganization is initiated to integrate the Rigs into Rowan's international

<<<

 ownership structure, through a subsidiary organized in Gibraltar. Rigs that are intended to work outside of the United States are typically held in Rowan's international structure so as to maximize economies of scale, and for administrative

<<<

 and operational reasons. In addition, Gibraltar is used as jurisdiction for the international ownership for US tax reasons, and it may have significant negative tax effect if the present SKDP ownership structure with Cyprus is to be maintained

<<<

.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions to the above.

Yours Sincerely,

Finn Bjornstad (Attorney in Fact)
