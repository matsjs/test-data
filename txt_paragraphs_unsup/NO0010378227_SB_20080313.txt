Waiver of financial covenants - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned Loan (the "Loan"). All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned

<<<

 to them in the Loan Agreement or in the summons to this Bondholders' meeting.

Background Reference is made to the Summons to bondholders meeting held on 14 February 2008 where a waiver for financial covenants in the Loan Agreement was proposed

<<<

 but not accepted by the Bondholders. Wega Mining ASA (the "Borrower or Wega"), has now negotiated with Macquarie Bank Limited (the "Bank") and reached an acceptance of amended terms and conditions for the loan facility from the Bank (the "Bank

<<<

 Facility") which they also believe will be acceptable and favorable to the Bondholders.

The Bank Facility will finance the Burkino Faso company Société ("Société"), which is the holder of Wegas gold project in Belahouro in Burkino Faso (the

<<<

 "Project"). The Project includes construction of an open pit mine, processing facilities and related infrastructure to enable the production of gold-silver oré for transport and smelting/refining. The Borrower has several projects planned,

<<<

 but the Project is the project closest to being operational, i.e. bringing cash flow in to the Borrower's Group. The Project completion test is expected to be accomplished by end of May 2009.

New company structure of the Borrower. The Borrower

<<<

 will restructure the group and will after the restructuring have the following three fully owned subsidiaries: GRWA (Burkina Faso), BEAL (Burkina Faso) and a new Norwegian registered company, for the time being called Newco AS ("Newco").
Newco

<<<

 will own 90 % of the shares in Société. The Newco is established only to help facilitate the financing of the Project. Newco shall be strictly a SPV holding company, and the only assets shall be the shares in Société and certain bank accounts

<<<

. Newco shall have no other liabilities than the proposed Newco Guarantee described below. Newco and Société are collectively referred to as the project related companies (the "Project Related Companies")

The Bank Facility

To partially finance

<<<

 the cost of construction and development of the Project, Macquarie Bank

Limited (the "Bank") has offered Societe a loan facility of USD 65 million (the "Offer") with

final maturity 30 June 2012, together with swaps, hedging, foreign exchange

<<<

 etc. In addition

to the Bank Facility the Borrower has invested USD 20 million in equity in the Project

(Societe). The Bank Facility will require the following security in favor of the Bank:

· A first ranking priority security interest in

<<<

 all of Societe's tangible and intangible assets (the "Societe Asset Pledge") According to the Loan Agreement clause 13.2.d) iv) this security will not require any approval from the Bondholders.

· A pledge over all shares Newco holds in Societe

<<<

 (the Societe Share Pledge") According to The Borrower, local legislation necessitates the shares being pledged in order to make the asset pledge effective. The Borrower points out that as a consequence of all the assets of Societe being pledged

<<<

 to the Bank, a pledge over the shares in Societe will not constitute a significant effect on the rights of the Bondholders.

· A pledge over all of the assets in Newco ("Newco Asset Pledge"). Newco is a SPV company and part of the Project 

<<<

"leg" of the company structure, and all assets of Newco will be related to the Project.

· A pledge over all the shares the Borrower holds in Newco (the "Newco Share Pledge"). The only assets of Newco will be the shares of Societe and certain

<<<

 bank accounts (DSRA & Intercompany Loan Account) related to the Project and the Bank Facility.

· A guarantee from Newco (the "Newco Guarantee") to cover cost overruns of the Project as well as the fulfillment of obligations under the Bank

<<<

 Facility.

· NewCo shall maintain a Debt Service Account ("DSRA") The balance of the DSRA may be funded from excess Project cashflow prior to the first principal repayment and the account is to be maintained in USD to a minimum cash balance

<<<

 representing Societe's debt service obligations estimated for the following six-month period. The DSRA shall be pledged to the Bank. Newco shall also maintain an inter company loan account. Both the DSRA and the inter company company loan account

<<<

 shall be pledged to the Bank (the "Account Pledge").

There shall be no recourse from the Project Related Companies towards the other companies in the group

Apart from the Societe Asset Pledge, all the above securities and guarantees formally

<<<

 requires an approval from the Bondholders.

The Proposal For more detailed information about the proposal you may contact, Wega Mining ASA, CFO Sverre Slattsveen, phone: +47 23 16 01 03.

The Borrower requests a waiver of the financial covenants

<<<

 to allow for the following specific securities as described above to be established:
The Societe Share Pledge
-2 -

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
The Newco Share Pledge The Newco Asset Pledge The Newco Guarantee The Account Pledge
For the

<<<

 avoidance of doubt; the waiver is a carve-out for the defined and specified above mentioned securities to be established, and does not waive the covenants in general, all covenants remain in effect.
Provided that the summoned Bondholders' meeting

<<<

 approves the requested waivers, the Borrower will compensate the Bondholders with a finite waiver fee of 0.50 % (flat). The record date of the waiver fee will be by the end of the business day after the date of the Bondholders' meeting, and

<<<

 will be due six banking days after the day of the bondholders meeting.
The Borrower also undertakes to each year flow up the maximum of cash allowed under the Bank Facility agreement from Societe to Newco and from Newco to the Borrower.
To

<<<

 enable the Borrower to conduct the proposed waivers of the relevant covenants in the Toan Agreement, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed waivers.
In the Loan

<<<

 Trustee's opinion, the proposal adheres to the principle of isolating project related risk to the project company Societe and the Norwegian project holding company Newco. The proposed waiver isolates the project risk to the relevant company

<<<

 "leg", and should as such be in line with the ring-fencing principles in the Loan Agreement. The Societe Share Pledge, the Newco Share Pledge, the Newco Asset Pledge, the Newco Guarantee and the Account Pledge are all formally not in compliance

<<<

 with the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, but should not in reality add any significant encumbrances, as the Borrower is already allowed, according to Clause 13.2 (d), (iv) of the Loan Agreement, to mortgage or pledge the assets

<<<

 of the Project.
The Bondholders must themselves evaluate whether the proposed waiver and the offered compensation is acceptable to them.
