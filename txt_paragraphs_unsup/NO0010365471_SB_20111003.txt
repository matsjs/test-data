2. BACKGROUND
Below you will find an explanation from the Company for the Proposal. Bondholders should read such background explanation before reading the Proposal.
Rocksource has so far in 2011 drilled four exploration prospects, of

<<<

 which one is a significant gas discovery (the `Norvarg' discovery, in license PL 535, Barents Sea, Norway), and three were dry wells (PL 416 in the North Sea, Norway, PL 559 in the Norwegian Sea, and AGC Profond PSC, offshore Senegal/Guinea

<<<

 Bissau). On 19 September the Company announced the start of drilling at its fifth well (to test the Heilo prospect, PL 530, Barents Sea, Norway).
In parallel with the 2011 drilling campaign, the Company matured the next tranche of prospects

<<<

, and expects to take three to four drilling decisions in Q4 2011. Positive decisions will lead to wells in 2012/2013.
Rocksource has currently two material discoveries containing proven hydrocarbons, with mean contingent resources estimated

<<<

 at 150 million barrels of oil equivalents ("mmboe"); Norvarg (Rocksource 20 per cent) and Trident in the Gulf of Mexico (Rocksource 100 per cent).
Rocksource is currently funded throughout 2011 and into 2012 through a NOK 250 million equity

<<<

 issue completed in February 2011, the farm down of half its interest in the AGC Profond PSC which added USD 28 million to 2011 cash flow, and a NOK 850 million NCS exploration credit facility ("NCS credit facility") provided by SEB Merchant

<<<

 Bank for 2011,
The Company's aim is that monetization of discoveries will be the main source of capital going forward. In addition, it will continue to seek commercial options to reduce capital exposure and optimize the value of its portfolio

<<<

; as it achieved with the AGC farm down.
The Bond Issue was originally established to mainly support the Company's US onshore production activities. Subsequent to the sale of the US onshore assets earlier this year, the Bond Issue was partly

<<<

 repaid from NOK 200 million to NOK 182.5 million.
The Company believes the Proposal as described below is important for two key reasons:
1) to enable the Company to demonstrate sufficient financial capacity for the calendar year 2012, in order

<<<

 to be able to meet the requirements for renewal of the NCS credit facility; and
2) to align the maturity of the Bond Issue with the Company's strategy to raise capital through monetizing discoveries.
For companies exploring in Norway, an NCS

<<<

 credit facility is considered one of the most important financial vehicles. The credit facility bridges the time from when NCS exploration costs are incurred until the 78 per cent tax refund from the Norwegian Tax

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
Authorities is received the year after. The credit facility reduces short term cash flow impact of NCS

<<<

 exploration costs by approximately 74 per cent. To establish such a facility requires, inter alia, demonstration to banks providing the facility of sufficient financial capacity for the full year.
Optimal monetization of upstream oil and gas

<<<

 assets typically takes a minimum of 12 months from the date of discovery, in order to ensure a competitive process and obtain a fair price. Buyers demand the opportunity to carry out comprehensive technical due diligence prior to making a bid

<<<

, and it often takes three to six months before all necessary reports from a well are available for a data room. In a well-functioning asset market, once these reports are available, it generally takes six to nine months from initial contact

<<<

 with potential buyers to final government approval of a deal.
3. THE PROPOSAL
The Company proposes the following amendments to the terms of the Bond Agreement. In order for these amendments to take effect, the Proposal must be approved by a

<<<

 bondholders' meeting.
3.1 The Proposal:
a) The Maturity Date as defined in clause 1 Definitions shall be extended by one year, from 4 May 2012 to 4 May 2013 (the "Extended Maturity Date"). However in the event that the Company does not raise

<<<

 a minimum of NOK 50 million in new equity by no later than 1 February 2013, the Extended Maturity Date shall be this date.
b) The Margin as defined in Clause 1 Definitions shall be increased by 2.00 per cent per annum, from 5,00 per cent per

<<<

 annum to 7.00 per cent per annum. Consequently, the Interest Rate shall be three months NIBOR + 7.00 per cent per annum from the first Interest Payment Date after the date on which the Conditions Precedent, as defined below, are met.
c) The

<<<

 Company shall redeem NOK 60 million of the Bond Issue at par plus accrued interests on the redeemed amount. The redemption shall take place not later than 5 business days after the Conditions Precedent are met.
d) In the event the Company and

<<<

/or any of its subsidiaries decides to sell or otherwise dispose of any asset regardless of such asset are currently pledged or not, the net proceeds from such sale or disposal shall be split between the Bondholders and the Company on the basis

<<<

 of a ratio of 65% to the Bondholders and 35% to the Company. The portion allocated the Bondholders shall be applied to redeem the Bond Issue at 104.00% plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount. The existing clause 10.3 shall be deleted

<<<

.
e) The Call Option as described in clause 10.2 shall be substituted and a non-call provision shall apply and to be applicable from the date of which the Conditions precedent are met and up to the Extended Maturity Date.

f) The Bond Issue shall be granted additional security as agreed between the Trustee and the Company

<<<

, The new security will include inter alia share pledges in relevant subsidiaries,
g) The Company and/or any of its subsidiaries undertakes not to invest nor make any investment commitments in any additional licenses outside the Norwegian Continental

<<<

 Shelf ("NCS") unless such investment is financed by additional equity or through asset sales.

i) All redemptions of

<<<

 the Bonds shall be executed on a pro-rata basis.
3.2 Conditions
The Proposal is subject that the following conditions precedent (the "Conditions Precedent") is satisfied:
a) the approval of the Proposal by the Bondholders in the Bondholder

<<<

 Meeting, with the required majority as defined under the Bond Agreement;
b) the execution of necessary amendments of the Bond Agreement; and c) evidence satisfactory to the Trustee that an NCS exploration credit facility
agreement applicable

<<<

 for the calendar year 2012 is fully committed by a reputable bank.
4. COMPANY UPDATE In addition to this summons letter, Rocksource provides a separate document, primarily excerpts from its most recent stock exchange releases and quarterly

<<<

 reports, which is intended to give an update of the Borrower's financial and operational status, enclosed in Exhibit 1 to this summons letter. Bondholders are encouraged to read the summons letter and the exhibit, as well as the Borrower's

<<<

 latest financial reports.
For access to the latest quarterly reports and other recent presentations, please visit the Company's web site www.rocksource.com.
5. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL Rocksource's evaluation: Based on its current financial

<<<

 situation, Rocksource is of the opinion that the Bondholders are offered a fair and balanced solution by the proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement.

NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
The Company considers the Proposal to be an important step in order to create a more viable and permanent capital structure enhancing values for both the Bondholders

<<<

 and other stakeholders independent of results from the PL 530 exploration well.
The Company's intention is to redeem the remaining outstanding amount of the Bond Issue as soon as possible and the Proposal includes provisions securing redemption

<<<

 of the Bond Issue as soon as the Company is able to monetize its asset base.
Rocksource considers that the Proposal is unrelated to the outcome of the final well in the 2011 campaign. The Company advises that drilling operations on the Heilo

<<<

 prospect may have reached target reservoirs before or at the time of the Bondholders' Meeting. If so, the partnership in the Heilo prospect PL 530 may receive indications or information about the outcome of the well before or at the time of

<<<

 the Bondholders' Meeting. Rocksource will announce any information about the outcome of the well in accordance with Oslo Stock Exchange rules and regulations, and according to market practice. This means that the Bondholders' Meeting might

<<<

 take place even though information about the outcome of the well has not yet been announced by Rocksource and/or the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.
Non-reliance of Trustee: Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders

<<<

 by the Trustee. The Bondholders should independently evaluate the Proposal and vote accordingly.
The Company informs that the Proposal is supported by the largest Bondholders in the Bond Issue.
6. SUMMON FOR BONDHOLDERS' MEETING Based on the

<<<

<<<

 the outstanding Bonds being represented at the Bondholder's Meeting. Bondholders may be represented in person or by proxy.
-oOo-
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the

<<<

 printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. (If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS the custodian

<<<

 must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered).

<<<

 telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or

<<<

 enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Norsk Tillitsmann considers as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.

4. Second quarter and first half year 2011
The Rocksource Group reported operating income (excluding revenue from US onshore assets) of NOK 159.2

<<<

 million in the second quarter of 2011 and NOK 160.5 million for the first six months of 2011. The operating income includes an income of NOK 152.8 million from the farm-down agreement with Noble Energy in AGC Profond PSC in June.
Rocksource

<<<

's US onshore assets were divested in June, and income and expenses from the US onshore assets and the profit of the sale, have been presented on a separate line "Net profit/ (loss) from discontinued operations" in the income statements. Net

<<<

 profit in second quarter, including profit from sale of the assets, totalled NOK 1.2 million. In the first half year of 2011 the discontinued operations gave a loss of NOK 0.7 million.
Exploration expenses totalled NOK 123.7 million in the

<<<

 quarter, including exploration expenses previously capitalised at NOK 82.5 million. Net profit in the quarter was NOK 60.9 million, compared to a loss of NOK 136.9 million in the second quarter of 2010. Accumulated profit for the first half

<<<

 year 2011 was NOK 19.0 million.
The Company's exploration campaign embarked in April with the spud of the Norvarg well in PL 535 in the Barents Sea. The well was later reported as a gas discovery, with a current resource estimate of 10-50 recoverable

<<<

 GSm3 (billion cubic meters). Wells two and three in the campaign, the Breiflabb and Kora wells respectively, both spudded in June. Results were published in July and both wells were confirmed dry.
5. Balance sheet and liquidity
Rocksource's

<<<

 total balance sheet as of 30 June 2011 was NOK 1,185.9 million compared to NOK 960.8 million in first quarter 2011 and NOK 742.0 million at yearend 2010.
To strengthen its financial situation, Rocksource successfully completed a NOK 250 million

<<<

 equity issue in February 2011. The equity at 30 June 2011 was NOK 614.9 million compared to NOK 550.4 million at 31 March 2011 and NOK 339.6 million at the year-end 2010, giving an equity ratio of 51.9 per cent, up from 47.4 per cent at the

<<<

 end of the corresponding quarter 2010.
The cash balance at the end of the second quarter was NOK 480.8 million compared to NOK 385.3 million at the end of previous quarter. The increase is mainly due to the positive cash flow from operating

<<<

 activities as a result of the farm-down transaction with Noble Energy. The net proceeds from the sale of the US assets have been used to repay Bondholders by NOK 17.5 million in the third quarter. Most of the cash impact from the 2011 drilling

<<<

 campaign will be booked in third and fourth quarter.
Current liabilities have increased in the quarter as a consequence of a reclassification of the bond loan to short term debt due to maturity in May 2012.
Draw down on the credit facility

<<<

 was NOK 29 million in the quarter and available facility amount was NOK 300 million at the end of the second quarter 2011. In the third
8

quarter Rocksource has increased the total amount available in the exploration credit facility from

<<<

 SEB Merchant Bank from NOK 500 million to NOK 850 million.
6. Drilling update
Norvarg In June 2011, Rocksource announced a gas discovery in the Norvarg prospect in the Barents Sea license PL 535, operated by Total E&P Norge AS. On Norvarg Rocksource

<<<

's electromagnetic (EM) technology successfully identified the stacked hydrocarbon reservoirs present within the structure. A production test was conducted with encouraging results. Preliminary estimates provided by the Operator indicate the

<<<

 size of the discovery at between 10- 50 recoverable GSm3 (billion cubic meters), corresponding to ca. 63-315 million barrels recoverable oil equivalent.
Breiflabb Earlier in July 2011, Rocksource announced a dry well on the Breiflabb prospect

<<<

 in license PL 416 in the Norwegian part of the North Sea. The Breiflabb prospect was characterized by a weak EM anomaly and was estimated to have a pre drill chance of success of 44 per cent. The false positive response (EM anomaly not associated

<<<

 with hydrocarbon) is believed to have come from deeper levels that were not penetrated by the well.
Kora In July 2011, The Kora-1 well in offshore Senegal and Guinea Bissau was amiounced as unsuccessful. The prospect was found dry and the strong

<<<

 EM anomaly is believed to have been caused by a combination of lithologies (rock types) which have combined to produce unusually high resistivity. Although these lithologies were not specifically predicted pre-drill, given the lack of well

<<<

 control in this frontier area it was accounted for in Rocksource's prospect risking. Prior to drilling, Rocksource farmed down half of its interest in AGC Profond receiving as an initial consideration, USD 28 million in promoted contribution

<<<

 towards past expenditure and the costs of the Kora-1 well.
Phoenix In September 2011 the Phoenix well in the Norwegian Sea was announced as unsuccessful. The well encountered reservoir sands in the Jurassic upper Åre formation, the lower Are

<<<

 formation, the Grey Beds and in the upper part of the Triassic Red Beds, but did not encounter hydrocarbons. Data acquisition in the well is ongoing, and the information from the well will be used in further evaluation of the PL 559 license

<<<

. A final press release will be provided by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate upon completion of the well operations.
Heilo PL 530 which includes the Heilo prospect is located in the Barents Sea on trend with the Goliat discovery to the west

<<<

 and the Nucula discovery to the southeast. The license which is operated by GDF Suez was reported to be the most sought after block in the Norwegian 2.0th Licensing Round. Rocksource carries a mean volume estimate of 200 million boe and a chance

<<<

 of success of approximately 50 per cent for the Heilo prospect, A success in the initial target will trigger a sidetrack to allow further efficient appraisal of the structure.

7. Outlook On the NCS the Company has drill or drop decisions

<<<

 to be made on PL 506, 515, 528 and 588 within the coming two to six months and is currently completing the prospect evaluations in preparation for those decisions. In addition an appraisal well in PL 535 might be decided by the partnership

<<<

 to be drilled in 2012/2013. In the Gulf of Mexico the Company has high graded two leases for potential drilling. Portfolio additions following the successful awards in APA 2010 and NCS 21st Round add long term exploration opportunities to the
