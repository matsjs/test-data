1 INTRODUCTION

<<<

 AND BACKGROUND
1.1 Operational update
On the Huntington field, first oil was achieved on 12 April 2013 with gas exports commencing on 4 June 2013. While reservoir and well performance to date has been excellent, full commissioning of the gas

<<<

 export systems is taking longer time than envisaged due to some initial system issues, which the operator expects will be resolved shortly. Once resolved, the field is expected to continue ramping up from current production of around 10,00

<<<

0 boepd gross toward a plateau rate of 30,000 boepd gross. Noreco's share of this, 6,000 boepd, will give significant contribution to the Company's cash flow

NORSK TILLITSMANN

The Nini, Nini East, and Cecilie fields will be shut down for a total of 16 days in June for planned maintenance and Siri repair work. These fields have

<<<

 been producing well. The Lulita field is currently off line and has not produced this month while the operator removes wax from the oil export pipeline.
As previously reported, production from the Oselvar field is considerably lower than originally

<<<

 planned. Work is underway to understand the reason for the weak production and to identify potential improvement measures. Should there be negative conclusions from this work, this may have negative impact on the book value of the field, but

<<<

 no significant effect on the equity ratio. The Oselvar field has been shut down since 29 May 2013 due to planned Ekofisk and Ula maintenance. Production is expected to commence mid July.
Noreco's exploration program currently consists of five

<<<

 committed wells. The first well on this program is the Gotha well in licence PL492 in the Barents Sea, where drilling is expected to start during the third quarter this year. The Company will continue developing its exploration portfolio which

<<<

 will provide the basis for future exploration activity, through active portfolio management and high-grading of the portfolio, and participation in licensing rounds and potential farm-ins.
1.2 Financial update
The Company has taken important

<<<

 steps in addressing its financial position and capital structure through the recent equity issue and two new bond issues.
Through 2013, the Company expects to make significant reductions in debt level and optimize the debt portfolio, driven

<<<

 both by cash flow from operations and the special tax refund of NOK 722.7 million plus interest from discontinuation of the petroleum activities in the parent company, which will be refunded as part of the ordinary tax refund in December. This

<<<

 tax refund has been pre approved by Norwegian tax authorities, and was in April finally claimed as part of the ordinary tax reporting for the Company. Both the ordinary tax refund and this tax refund from discontinuation of the petroleum activities

<<<

 on parent level are expected to be refunded on or about 20 December 2013. Given the maturity of the NOR05 Bond on 6 December 2013, there may be a liquidity gap of approximately 14 days. On this basis, the Company has today summoned a separate

<<<

 Bondholders' Meeting in the NOR05 Bond to approve a short maturity extension to bridge such potential cash shortfall.
As previously disclosed, the gearing ratio exceeded the covenant level in the Bond Agreements at the end of Q1 2013. A default

<<<

 may only be declared if the Issuer is in breach with a covenant for two consecutive quarters and further provided that the covenant breach is not remedied within 60 days following the end of the second of such quarters. Due to the slower than

<<<

 expected ramp up of production on the Huntington field, the Company believes that the gearing ratio may still be above the 5.Ox covenant level for a short period after the 60 day's period.
1.3 Requested waivers and amendments
On the above basis

<<<

, Noreco wishes to put forward a request to the Bondholders for a temporary waiver of certain gearing ratio covenants contained in each of the Bond Agreements. As compensation for such waivers and amendment, Noreco offers a fee to the Bondholders

<<<

 upon approval in the Bondholders' Meetings to be held in each of the Bonds.
A gearing ratio covenant exists in each of the Bond Agreements, calculated as "Net Interest Bearing Debt / Adjusted EBITDA". The definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the

<<<

 NOR04 Bond Agreement differs slightly from the definition used in the NOR05, NOR06/07, NOR08 and NOR09 Bond Agreements with respect to how gains and losses from asset sales and write-downs are to be treated. Therefore, the gearing ratio of

<<<

 the NOR04 Bond ("Gearing Ratio 1" / "GR1") differs slightly from that applicable to the NOR05, NOR08, NOR09 and NOR06/07 Bond ("Gearing Ratio 2" / "GR2").
As presented in the figure below, for Q1 2013 the Gearing Ratio 1 was 5.lx and the Gearing

<<<

 Ratio 2 was 5.5x, compared to the maximum covenant level of 5.Ox for both gearing ratios. The ratios have historically been in the 3-4 range (see graph and table below). The graph below shows the development of Gearing Ratio 1 and Gearing Ratio

<<<

 2 over the recent financial quarters. The Gearing Ratios are expected to be well below covenant level within the end of 2013.

5.1 5.5

It is Noreco's view that the gearing covenant breaches are of a temporary nature, and that the situation is expected to be resolved as a consequence of the special tax refund o f NOK 722.7 million (plus interest) from discontinuation

<<<

 of the petroleum activities in the parent company. Furthermore the Company expects Huntington production to ramp up to full capacity in 2013, which will have a significant deleveraging effect. It is Noreco's view that the waiver proposal, as

<<<

 described in 2.1 will provide the Company with sufficient headroom.

 on the date of the Bondholders' Meeting) within ten (10) Business Days after the Bondholders' Meetings for the Bonds, provided that each and all such Bondholders' Meetings accepts the Waiver Proposal for the respective bonds as set out in section

2.3 Conditions

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

3

<<<

.1 The Company's evaluation

The potential breach of the gearing ratio covenants is temporary, and it will be remedied through additional production from Huntington coming on-stream. With Huntington on-stream, the additional cash flow will bring

<<<

 the Company in compliance with the gearing ratio covenants within one quarter of full production. The Company is thus using its best efforts to mitigate the breach, and to lower the total gearing in the Company over time.

The Huntington production

<<<

 is expected to substantially improve cash flow. The increased cash flow will together with the tax refund of NOK 722.7 million plus interests mitigate the potential temporary gearing covenant breach and provide the Company with a comfortable

<<<

 position towards its gearing ratios covenants and its debt obligations going forward. The Company expects to be well below the covenant level within year end.

In the Company's opinion, the compensation fee offered to the Bondholders as a compensation

<<<

 for the waivers is a fair and balanced proposal based on the temporary nature of the gearing ratio waiver and the net debt position taking account the Norwegian tax refunds to be received in December 2013.

The Company has engaged Arctic Securities

<<<

 ASA, Pareto Securities AS and Swedbank First Securities as the Company's financial advisors (the "Advisors") with respect to the Waiver Proposal. Accordingly, Bondholders may contact the Advisors as follows for further information:

Arctic

<<<

 Securities ASA, Fixed Income Sales at + 47 21 01 30 60; Pareto Securities AS, Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 00; or Swedbank First Securities, Fixed Income Sales at +47 23 11 62 73

The Advisors are acting solely for the Company and no

<<<

-one else in connection with the Waiver Proposal. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by the Advisors with respect to the Company, and the Advisors expressly disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the

<<<

 Proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein).

3.2 Non-Reliance

The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently

<<<

 evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
