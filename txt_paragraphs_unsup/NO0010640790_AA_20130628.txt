C.10 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to this clause C.10 have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price

<<<

 or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other events or circumstances which have already given or will give rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price or where more than one event which gives

<<<

 rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion of the Loan Trustee, a modification to the operation of the adjustment provisions is required to give the intended result, such modification

<<<

 shall be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be advised by an Independent Financial Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended result.
C. 11 For the purpose of any calculation of the consideration receivable

<<<

 or price pursuant to clauses C.4, C.6, C.7 and C.8, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Shares issued for cash shall be the amount of such cash;
(b) (x) the aggregate consideration receivable

<<<

 or price for Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the conversion or exchange of any Securities shall be deemed to be the consideration or price received or receivable for any such Securities and (y) the aggregate consideration

<<<

 receivable or price for Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the exercise of rights of subscription attached to any Securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or rights shall be deemed to be that part (which may

<<<

 be the whole) of the consideration or price received or receivable for such Securities or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or rights which are attributed by the Issuer to such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such

<<<

 options, warrants or rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is so attributed, the Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights as at the date of the first public announcement

<<<

 of the terms of issue of such Securities or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights, plus in the case of each of (x) and (y) above, the additional minimum consideration receivable or price (if any) upon the conversion or exchange

<<<

 of such Securities, or upon the exercise of such rights or subscription attached thereto or, as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights and (z) the consideration receivable or price per Share upon the conversion or

<<<

 exchange of, or upon the exercise of such rights of subscription attached to, such Securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights shall be the aggregate consideration or price referred to in (x) or

<<<

 (y) above (as the case may be) divided by the number of Shares to be issued upon such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate;

 Adviser to be the spot rate ruling at the close of business on the date of the first public announcement of the terms of issue of such Securities (or if no such rate is available on that date, the

equivalent rate

<<<

 on the immediately preceding date on which such rate is available); and
(d) in determining consideration or price pursuant to the above, no deduction shall be made for any commissions or fees (howsoever described) or any expenses paid or incurred

<<<

 for any underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the relevant Shares or Securities or otherwise in connection therewith.
C. 12 If the Conversion Date in relation to the conversion of any Bond shall be after any consolidation or sub

<<<

-division as is mentioned in clause C.l, or after the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for any such issue, distribution, grant or offer (as the case may be) as is mentioned in clauses C.2, C.3, C.4, C.5 or C

<<<

.9, or after any such issue or grant as is mentioned in clause C.6 and C.l, in any case in circumstances where the relevant Conversion Date falls before the relevant adjustment becomes effective under this clause C (such adjustment, a "Retroactive

<<<

 Adjustment"), then the Issuer shall (conditional upon the relevant adjustment becoming effective) procure that there shall be issued or delivered to the converting Bondholder, such additional number of Shares (if any) (the "Additional Shares

<<<

") as, together with the Shares issued or to be issued or delivered on conversion of the relevant Bond (together with any fraction of a Share not so issued), is equal to the number of Shares which would have been required to be issued or delivered

<<<

 on conversion of such Bond if the relevant adjustment (more particularly referred to in the said provisions of this clause C) to the Conversion Price had in fact been made and become effective immediately prior to the relevant Conversion Date

<<<

. Additional Shares will be delivered to Bondholders not later than 10 Banking Days following the date the relevant Retroactive Adjustment becomes effective (the "Reference Date").
C. 13 No adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where

<<<

 Shares or other Securities (including rights, warrants and options) are issued, offered, exercised, allotted, appropriated, modified or granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees (including Directors holding or formerly

<<<

 holding executive office or the personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or relatives, in each case, of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees to be held for the benefit of any such

<<<

 person, in any such case pursuant to any employees' share or option scheme.
C.14 On any adjustment, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple of USD 0.001, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of USD 0.001.

<<<

 No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent, of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which

<<<

 the Conversion Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at

<<<

 the relevant time.
Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Issuer to Bondholders and the Loan Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.
50

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
The Conversion Price shall not in any

<<<

 event be reduced to below the nominal value of the Shares and the Issuer undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price to below

<<<

 such nominal value.
C. 15 If changes are made in the share capital other than those mentioned above, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to the Shareholders, the Loan Trustee and the Issuer shall agree on a new Conversion Price

<<<

. This also applies to other transactions, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders.
C.16 If the Conversion Price is below par value of the Shares, par value of the Shares still applies, and the Issuer shall upon conversion pay the Bondholders

<<<

 the difference between the par value of the Shares and the Conversion Price.
C.17 If an adjustment of the Conversion Price requires a conversion to USD, the exchange rate shall be the Exchange Rate on the date triggering such adjustments. For

<<<

 the avoidance of doubt, when calculating weighted averages over several days, the Exchange Rate should be applied on each relevant day.
C. 18 For the sake of clarity, no further adjustment shall be made for the issue of (i) equity which by

<<<

 way of operation of the Equity Issue Price already has resulted in a change to the Conversion Price, or (ii) shares or other securities to be issued in accordance with the term sheet dated 25 April 2013 between the Issuer and its principal

<<<

 creditors in connection with the contemplated financial restructuring of the Issuer.
D Merger and de-merger
D. 1 If the Issuer prior to the expiry of the Conversion Period decides on a statutory merger (in accordance with prevailing legislation

<<<

 from time to time) in which the Issuer is the acquired company, each Bondholder has the right to require the Bonds to be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.
The Issuer shall give the Bondholders written notification through the Securities

<<<

 Depository at the latest five (5) Banking Days after notification of the merger. The notification shall refer to the regulations and deadlines of clause D.2.
D.2 Request for redemption takes place by the Bondholder notifying his Account Managers

<<<

 at the latest two (2) months after notification of the merger. Each Bondholder's Account Managers shall then promptly forward the request to the Paying Agent.
Redemption shall take place five (5) Banking Days after the acquiring company has

<<<

 notified that the merger shall be effective or, if later, five (5) Banking Days following the expiry of the two (2) months period.
D.3 In the case of any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Issuer with any other corporation (other

<<<

 than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger in which the Issuer is the continuing corporation), or in the case of any sale or transfer of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Issuer, the Issuer will take such steps as shall be required

<<<

 by the Loan Trustee (including the execution of an agreement supplemental to or amending the
51

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
Loan Agreement) to ensure that each Bond then outstanding will (during the period in which Conversion Rights may be exercised

<<<

) be converted into the class and amount of shares and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of Shares which would have become liable to be issued upon

<<<

 exercise of Conversion Rights immediately prior to such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer. Such supplemental agreement deed will provide for adjustments which will be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments

<<<

 provided for in clause C. The above will apply mutatis mutandis to any subsequent consolidations, amalgamations, mergers, sales or transfers. D.4 If the Issuer decides on a merger in which the Issuer is the acquiring company, and the shareholders

<<<

 of the acquired company receive settlement in the form of shares only, subject to confirmation from an Independent Financial Adviser that such is the case, no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price. If the shareholders of the acquired

<<<

 company receive settlement in any other form, in full or partly, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted according to such provision of clause C as an Independent Financial Adviser shall determine to be most appropriate. D.5 The provisions in

<<<

 this clause D have no limitation on the creditor's right of objection
to the merger or de-merger.
