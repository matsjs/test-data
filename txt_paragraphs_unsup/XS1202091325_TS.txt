EXECUTION VERSION
PRICING SUPPLEMENT DATED MARCH 10, 2015
Additional Tier 1 Notes are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors. In some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities have adopted

<<<

 or published laws, regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the Additional Tier 1 Notes to retail investors.
In particular, in August 2014, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") published the

<<<

 Temporary Marketing Restriction (Contingent Convertible Securities) Instrument 2014 (as amended or replaced from time to time, the "TMR"), which took effect on October 1, 2014. Under the rules set out in the TMR (as amended or replaced from

<<<

 time to time, the "TMR Rules"), certain contingent write-down or convertible securities, such as the Additional Tier 1 Notes, must not be sold to retail clients in the European Economic Area (the "EEA") and nothing may be done that would or

<<<

 might result in the buying of such securities or the holding of a beneficial interest in such securities by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the TMR Rules), other than in accordance with the limited exemptions

<<<

 set out in the TMR Rules.
The Dealers (as defined in the Program Document (as defined below)) are required to comply with the TMR Rules. By purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Additional Tier 1 Notes from the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Dealers, you represent, warrant, agree with and undertake to the Issuer and the Dealers that: (1) you are not a retail client in the EEA (as defined in the TMR Rules); (2) whether or not you are subject to the TMR Rules, you will

<<<

 not sell or offer the Additional Tier 1 Notes to retail clients in the EEA or do anything (including the distribution of this document) that would or might result in the buying of the Additional Tier 1 Notes or the holding of a beneficial interest

<<<

 in the Additional Tier 1 Notes by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the TMR Rules), other than (i) in relation to any sale or offer to sell Additional Tier 1 Notes to a retail client in or resident in the United

<<<

 Kingdom, in circumstances that do not and will not give rise to a contravention of the TMR Rules by any person and/or (ii) in relation to any sale or offer to sell Additional Tier 1 Notes to a retail client in any EEA member state other than

<<<

 the United Kingdom, where (a) you have conducted an assessment and concluded that the relevant retail client understands the risks of an investment in the Additional Tier 1 Notes and is able to bear the potential losses involved in an investment

<<<

 in the Additional Tier 1 Notes and (b) you have at all times acted in relation to such sale or offer in compliance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) ("MiFID") to the extent it applies to you or, to the extent

<<<

 MiFID does not apply to you, in a manner which would be in compliance with MiFID if it were to apply to you; and (3) you will at all times comply with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside the EEA

<<<

) relating to the promotion, offering, distribution and/or sale of the Additional Tier 1 Notes, including any such laws, regulations and regulatory guidance relating to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in the

<<<

 Additional Tier 1 Notes by investors in any relevant jurisdiction.
Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed client when purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Additional Tier 1 Notes from the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Dealers, the foregoing representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings will be given by and be binding upon both the agent and its underlying client.
