a. The filing for judicial reorganisation in Brazil by the Ultimate Parent on 11 November 2013 (which constituted an Event of Default under Clause 15.1{G){Insolvency) of

<<<

 the Bond Agreement);

b. The Issuer's failure to replenish the Retention Account in November 2013 as it was required to do so pursuant to Clause 13.4(b) of the Bond Agreement (which constituted an Event of Default under Clauses 15.1(a)(Non

<<<

-payment) and 15.1(b)(Breach o f other obligations) of the Bond Agreement); and

c. The Issuer's failure to pay (i) the interest due to the Bondholders on 20 December 2013 as it was required to do so pursuant to Clause 9 of the Bond Agreement

<<<

, and (ii) certain invoices that it is obliged to pay pursuant to Clause 14 of the Bond Agreement, (which constituted an Event of Default under Clause 15A(a)(Non-payment) of the Bond Agreement).

In each case, the Bond Trustee notified the Issuer

<<<

 of such Event of Default, but confirmed that it was not declaring the Outstanding Bonds to be due for immediate payment, nor making a demand on the Guarantees, although it reserved the right to do so at any time.

Restructuring Discussions

<<<



In consultation with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders who together hold in excess of 66 2/3% of the Bonds (the "Committee"), the Bond Trustee has, on behalf of the Bondholders, engaged, amongst others:

a. Bingham McCutchen (London

<<<

) LLP ("Bingham") to act as legal counsel to the Bond Trustee; and

b. AlixPartners LLP ("Alix" and together with Bingham, the "Advisers") to act as financial advisers to the Bond Trustee,

in each case, to represent the interests of the Bond

<<<

 Trustee and the Bondholders in connection with the financial position of the Issuer and its affiliates (the "OSX Group") including (without limitation) restructuring discussions and negotiations regarding the Bonds.

The Bond Trustee and its

<<<

 Advisers have been in discussions with the OSX Group for a number of months in connection with the outstanding Events of Default and a potential restructuring of the Bonds.

On 24 December 2013, the Charterer and Charterer Parent (together

<<<

, "OGX") announced that it had entered into a plan support agreement with holders of 8.500% Senior Notes due 2018 8.375% and Senior Notes due 2022 both issued by the Charterer Parent (the "OGX Noteholders"). The plan support agreement, and the

<<<

 plan of reorganisation which was subsequently filed by OGX on 14 February 2014 with the Brazilian restructuring court, contemplates a senior secured super priority post-petition DIP financing in two tranches in an aggregate amount of US$21

<<<

5 million (collectively, the "DIP Financing"). On February 7, 2014, OGX announced the entry into the DIP Financing. The proceeds of the DIP Financing are to be used to fund capital and operating expenses of OGX, including payment of charter

<<<

 rates for continued operations of the FPSO.

Since December 2013, and in light of the OGX developments, the restructuring discussions have involved not only the OSX Group and the Bond Trustee (in consultation with the Committee), but also OGX

<<<

 and certain of the OGX Noteholders, together with their respective advisers.

NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

As a result of the restructuring discussions, the Issuer wishes to propose the terms of a potential restructuring solution

<<<

 to the Bondholders (the "Restructuring"), the detailed terms of which are set out in:

a. the OGX-side restructuring termsheet set out at Appendix 1 (the "OGX Termsheet"); and

b. the OSX-side restructuring termsheet set out at Appendix 2 

<<<

(the "OSX Termsheet" and together with the OGX Termsheet, the "Termsheets").

As is contemplated in the Termsheets, the Issuer hereby convenes a Bondholders' Meeting in order to obtain the requisite approval of the Bondholders to the amendments

<<<

 provided for in the Termsheets (together, the "Amendments") and the other restructuring provisions.

Purpose of this Summons

The purpose of this Summons is to convene a Bondholders' Meeting pursuant to which the Bondholders can:

a. approve

<<<

 the terms of the Restructuring as set out in the Termsheets;

b. authorise and instruct the Bond Trustee (in consultation with its Advisers and, if necessary, the Committee) to agree the definitive documentation with OGX and the OSX Group 

<<<

(as applicable) that is necessary to document the terms of the Restructuring (on terms agreed between the relevant parties, the "Definitive Documentation");

c. approve and instruct the Bond Trustee to enter into the Definitive Documentation

<<<

;

d. authorise and instruct the Bond Trustee to enter into such agreements, documents and amendments and do all things necessary on behalf of the Bondholders as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to and implement the Restructuring

<<<

;

e. agree that the Bond Trustee may, at its discretion and in consultation with its Advisers and, if necessary, the Committee, consent to amendments to the terms of the Termsheets on behalf of the Bondholders where such amendments are of a

<<<

 minor or technical nature or are otherwise consistent with the Termsheets and are required in order to implement the Restructuring, including agreeing to a reasonable extension of the deadline by which the Definitive Documentation is to be

<<<

 agreed; and

f. agree that the Bond Trustee may, in consultation with its Advisers and, if necessary, the Committee, exercise (or refuse to exercise) any discretion, consent or approval required or contemplated in connection with the matters

<<<

 referred to in the Termsheets and that neither the Bond Trustee, its Advisers nor any members of the Committee shall have any liability whatsoever to any Bondholder or any other person in connection with the exercise (or non-exercise) of any

<<<

 such discretion which is exercised in good faith.

BACKGROUND TO RESTRUCTURING

The FPSO was delivered by OSX-3 to OGX on 19 November 2013 and has been producing oil since December 2013. Two well heads are currently connected to the Tubarao

<<<

 Martelo field with a further two scheduled to be connection in the near future. Production commenced on 6 December 2013 with output steadily declining from an initial peak and since mid-January has settled at an average of between 10,000 and

<<<

 11,000 barrels a day through to 28 February

NORSK TILLITSMANN

4/34

NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

2014. `Up time' has been consistently high with the exception of two days in February which, according to the OSX Group, was caused by a battery fault

<<<

. The FPSO continues to be fuelled by diesel as gas reserves from the two active wells are not sufficient to power the FPSO.

As was reported earlier in 2013, the oil field consultancy DeGolyer and MacNaughton certified that the Tubarao Martelo

<<<

 field has probable reserves of 87.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. This is significantly less than had been anticipated when the terms of the Charter Contract had been negotiated at the time that the Bonds were issued in March 2012.

Consequently

<<<

, it has become clear to all parties that the original charter rate of approximately $440,000 per day is not commercially sustainable given the production circumstances and that certain amendments will need to be made to the Charter Contract

<<<

 in order for the FPSO to continue to operate on the Tubarao Martelo field on a commercially viable basis.

4. SUMMARY OF RESTRUCTURING

Set out below is a summary of key terms of the Restructuring. The Bondholders should read the Termsheets

<<<

 in full in order to properly understand the terms of the Restructuring; the key terms below are not exhaustive.

A. OSX Termsheet

i. The coupon on the Bonds shall be increased from 9.25% to 13.00%, to be paid in cash and to accrue from 30

ii. A consent fee of 2.50% shall be paid to all Bondholders in the form of additional Bonds to be issued on the date that the amendment to the Bond Amendment is signed.

iii. There shall be a mandatory prepayment event in the

 event of a sale of OSX1 or OSX2, and excess proceeds from the sale of these vessels (subject to repayment in full of secured creditors at OSX1 and OSX2 and certain other obligations and retention amounts) shall be applied towards prepayment

<<<

 of principal of the Bonds.

iv. As long as the Bonds remain outstanding, the Bond Trustee shall appoint an independent director at OSX 3 Holding B.V., OSX 3 Holdco B.Y. and OSX 3 Leasing B.Y., and a board observer at OSX Leasing Group B.V.

<<<

, and each shall be afforded certain corporate governance rights and protections.

v. Inclusion of a buyout right in favour of OGX in certain circumstances where the Bonds have not been refinanced at maturity1.

B. OGX Termsheet

<<<

 failure to pay the charter rate under the Charter Contract (as amended).
