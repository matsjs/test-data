 Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010

Oslo, 10 November 2009
Proposal to affirm Authorisation of Petition for Bankruptcy of PetroMena ASA Summons to Bondholder's Meeting

1. BACKGROUND
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"/"Norsk Tillitsmann") is appointed

<<<

 loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of bonds (the "10.85% Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001039578.3 (the "10.85% Bond Loan") where PetroMena ASA is the borrower (the "Borrower").
All capitalized terms used herein

<<<

 shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement related to the 10.85% Bond Loan (the "10.85% Loan Agreement") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.
The 10.85% Loan Agreement was declared to be in

<<<

 default on 3. April 2009 after NTM received instruction to declare such a default by a majority of the Bondholders. The declaration of default has been upheld through two court decisions (first instance and appeal).
After having initiated several

<<<

 enforcement steps in Norway, Singapore, Scotland and Mexico, NTM decided, following consultation with a majority of the Bondholders to file a petition for the bankruptcy of the Borrower as it was assessed that the Borrower was no longer willing

<<<

 and capable to protect the interests of its creditors (including the Bondholders), either directly or through providing appropriate instructions to its subsidiaries, and in particular Petromena Limited being the owner of the "Petrolia" rig

<<<

 over which a mortgage has been granted to secure obligations owing to the Bondholders.
As Bondholders will be aware, on 15. September 2009 NTM filed the petition for bankruptcy of the Borrower, PetroMena ASA (the "Original Bankruptcy Proceedings

<<<

"). After the issuance of the Original Bankruptcy Proceedings, the Norwegian Court of Appeals (Lagmannsretten) found in another case that NTM is not the real creditor of the underlying claim with respect to bonds where it acts as loan trustee

<<<

, and therefore can not file legal proceedings for payment in its own name in the Norwegian courts under current Norwegian legislation. The Court of Appeal's decision has since been further appealed by NTM to the Supreme Court, from which judgment

<<<

 is awaited.

However, NTM had previously established a foundation (stiftelse) solely set up with the purpose to protect bondholders' rights through processes of restructuring (the "Foundation"). The Foundation therefore

<<<

 acquired, through its wholly owned subsidiary NTM Refectio III AS ("Refectio") certain 10.85 % Bonds, and announced in a supplementary pleading of 7 October 2009 to the bankruptcy court, its joinder as a new party to the Original Bankruptcy

<<<

 Proceedings.
The Bankruptcy Court indicated that it felt bound by the previous decision of the Court of Appeals referred to above, and found that NTM was not entitled to file the Original Bankruptcy Proceedings. The Bankruptcy Court concluded

<<<

, however, that Refectio had a cause of action according to the Civil Procedure Act, and that Refectio was also as a creditor who, according to the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act Section 60 had the right to file for bankruptcy. In particular, the

<<<

 court found that notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 15.5 of the 10.85 Loan Agreement that prevents individual Bondholders from recovering their Bonds directly from the Borrower, since the case was dismissed as far as NTM was concerned

<<<

, the 10.85% Loan Agreement must be revised in accordance with the Norwegian Contract Act section 36 and non-statutory law regarding subsequently failed contractual assumptions. However, the court argued that this does not imply that any given

<<<

 bondholder may, at its own discretion, engage in enforcement, and that that the 10.85 Loan Agreement prevented a single bondholder enforcing its individual claim where it was not apparent that this action was supported by Bondholders generally

<<<

.
Thus, since Refectio filed the petition in its own name without documenting that this was an act in accordance with / by consent from the Bondholders and NTM, the petition was deemed to be in conflict with Clause 15.5.
In view of the court

<<<

's decision, NTM propose that the Bondholders' meeting makes a decision that since Refectio already is deemed to have the standing to sue and to be a claimholder in substantive terms in accordance with the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act, NTM propose

<<<

 that Bondholders affirm NTM's consent and themselves consent that Refectio may file a bankruptcy petition against the Borrower in its own name and on its own behalf as an individual Bondholder.
2. INFORMATION ON NTM REFECTIO III AS AND ITS

<<<
