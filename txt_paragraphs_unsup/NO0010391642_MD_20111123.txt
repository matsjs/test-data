<<<

 occurring, the record date for the Voyageur Bonds will, pursuant to the terms of the Bondholder Summons and the Bondholder Term Sheet, be the Oslo business day immediately prior to the payment of the Voyageur Recovery Amount (the "Voyageur

<<<

 Record Date"). Under the terms of the proposed restructuring, as described in the Bondholder Summons, the Voyageur Recovery Amount will be paid on the earlier to occur of (i) 12 months from the date of First Completion; (ii) 15 December 20

<<<

12; (iii) the date on which Voyageur Completion occurs; and (iv) such earlier date as Teekay may determine. Accordingly, the Voyageur Record Date will not be set until a point in the future when it is know when the Voyageur Recovery Amount is

<<<

 due to be paid.

Pending payment of the Voyageur Recovery Amount, the Voyageur Bonds can continue to be traded such that Voyageur Bondholders (including the holders of claims for overdue payment of interest) of record on the Voyageur Record

<<<

 Date will be eligible to receive the Voyageur Proceeds and interest will, technically, continue to accrue on the Voyageur Bonds during this period. However, Voyageur Bondholders should be aware that the amount of principal, default premium

<<<

 and accrued interest in respect of the Voyageur Bonds to be applied for the purpose of allocation of payments in respect of each Voyageur Bond and each claim for overdue payment of interest in respect of a Voyageur Bond, will be fixed at an

<<<

 earlier date.

Therefore, assuming that First Completion will occur as scheduled on 30 November 2011, the amount of principal, default premium and accrued interest in respect of the Voyageur Bonds to be applied for the purpose of allocation

<<<

 of payments in respect of each Voyageur Bond and each claim for overdue payment of interest in respect of a Voyageur Bond, will be fixed as of 29 November 2011. Thus, no

interest or default interest accruing on the Yoyageur Bonds after 2

<<<

9 November 2011 will be taken into account for the purpose of allocating the amount of the Voyageur Recovery Amount to the Voyageur Bondholders (including the holders of claims for overdue payment of interest) of record as of the Voyageur Record
