 ASA Senior Callable Bond Issue 2010/2016
Oslo, 6 January, 2015
Summons to Bondholders' Meetings - Proposed changes to loan agreement and consent to proposed equity issue
Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Bond Trustee") for the holders

<<<

 of the abovementioned bond issue with ISIN NO 001 0584683 (the "Bond Loan") issued by Interoil Exploration and Production ASA (the "Issuer", the "Company" or "Interoil").
All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein (including

<<<

 any attachment hereto) shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Bond Loan dated 8 September 2010 (as amended) (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer is provided solely by the

<<<

 Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
Reference is made to the Issuer's press release of 23 December 2014 concerning the process

<<<

 to refinance the business and the offer that has been received by the Issuer from Andes Energia pic. ("Andes"), and to the Issuer's notice for an extraordinary general meeting to be held on 20 January 2015.
As explained in the press release

<<<

, Andes has made an offer to subscribe for 330,000,000 new shares in the Issuer for a subscription price of NOK 0.11 per share, in total NOK 36,300,000. It is a condition for Andes' offer that the bondholders in the Bond Loan (the "Bondholders

<<<

") convert a portion of the Bond Loan into 65,000,000 new shares in the Issuer by way of a partial set-off against the outstanding amount under the Bond Loan, and that the remaining outstanding amount under the Bond Loan is converted into a

<<<

 new bond loan with new terms as further explained below (the "New Bond Loan"). It is also a condition that the Company's debt of USD 6,200,000 towards the former shareholders of Proseis AG (the "Proseis Debt") is converted to the New Bond Loan

<<<

. After completion of the private placements Andes will own approximately 51% of the total number of shares in the Issuer, the Bondholders will own approximately 10% of the shares, and the current shareholders of the Issuer will own approximately

<<<

 39% of the shares.

The New Bond Loan will be based on the terms of the Bond Agreement, but with certain amendments to the commercial and legal terms as further described below. The New Bond Loan will have a principal amount of USD 32,000

<<<

,000, of which the Bondholders will own USD 30,000,000 and the former shareholders of Proseis AG will own USD 2,000,000. It is proposed that the Bondholders will receive the interest coupon of NOK 11,625,000 under the Bond Loan originally due

<<<

 on 14 December 2014 on the fifth Business Day after the issue date for the New Bond Loan, after deduction for settlement of advisor fees and other costs and expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee or by or on behalf of the Bondholders. Any interest

<<<

 from 14 December 2014 to the date of the implementation of the New Bond Loan shall be waived and not paid.

Andes intends to offer to the Bondholders that they guarantee the mandatory offer, against giving the Bondholders the right to acquire

<<<

 the shares that are sold to Andes under the mandatory offer. This option will be subject to a separate arrangement between the Bondholders and Andes.

It is a condition for the offer from Andes that the Bondholders undertake not to accept the

<<<

 mandatory offer from Andes for the 65,000,000 new shares that are acquired by the Bondholders through the partial conversion of the Bond Loan. It is proposed that the lock up is facilitated by the Bond Trustee, or an entity designated by the

<<<

 Bond Trustee, holding the shares on behalf of the Bondholders until the expiry of the offer period for the mandatory offer.

The equity issue towards Andes will constitute a change of control event under clause 16.5 of the Bond Agreement, and

<<<

 the Bondholders will therefore be required to waive the put option.

2.

<<<

 include:

(a) Amending the currency of the new bonds from NOK to USD. (b) The aggregate amount of the new bonds will be USD 32,000,000, of which USD
30,000,000 will be held by the Bondholders in the same proportion as they currently hold in

<<<
