<<<

 amount outstanding of SEK 750,000,000) (the "Bonds") issued by Candyking Holding AB (publ) (the "Issuer"). In its capacity as Agent, and as requested by certain Holders in accordance with Section 17 (b) of the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds

<<<

 (the "Terms and Conditions"), the Agent hereby convenes the Holders to a Written Procedure, whereby Holders can vote for or against the Requests (as defined below).
All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this notice

<<<

 (the "Notice") shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms and Conditions.
Holders participate by completing and sending the voting form, attached hereto as Schedule 1 (the "Voting Form"), and, if applicable, the power of attorney

<<<

/authorisation, attached hereto as Schedule 2 (the "Power of Attorney") or other sufficient evidence, if the Bonds are held in custody other than by the CSD, to the Agent. Please contact the securities firm you hold your Bonds through if you

<<<

 do not know how your Bonds are registered or if you need authorisation or other assistance to participate.
The Agent must receive the Voting Form no later than 17:00 (CET) on 17 January 2017 either by mail, courier or e-mail to the Agent using

<<<

 the contact details set out in Section 5.7 (Address for sending replies) below. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.
To be eligible to participate in the Written Procedure, a person must meet the criteria for being a Holder on 27 December

<<<

 2016 (the "Record Date"). This means that the person must be registered on a Securities Account with the CSD, as a direct registered owner (Sw. direktregistrerad ägare) or authorised nominee (Sw. förvaltare) with respect to one or several Bonds

<<<

.

Disclaimer: The Requests are presented to the Holders, without any evaluation, advice or recommendations from the Agent whatsoever. The Agent has not reviewed or assessed this Notice or the Requests (and their effects, should they be adopted

<<<

) from a legal or commercial perspective of the Holders and the Agent expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to the content of this Notice and the Requests (and their effects, should they be adopted). The Holders are recommended

<<<

 to seek legal advice in order to independently evaluate whether the Requests (and their effects) are acceptable or not.
1. Background
The market in which the Issuer operates is highly competitive. In order to improve its financial results,

<<<

 the Issuer has initiated discussions regarding its long term financing with its main shareholders AccentTwo Holding Limited and Accentfifteen Holding Limited (collectively "Accent") and certain beneficial owners of Bonds, representing approximately

<<<

 62.8 per cent. of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount (the "Committee"). The discussions have resulted in a proposed restructuring of the Issuer's ownership and financing structure (the "Restructuring"). As part of the Restructuring, and as announced

<<<

 by way of press release on 30 November 2016, Dani Evanoff, through his wholly owned company Off The Shelf 10012 AB ("Off The Shelf'), has agreed with Accent to acquire all of Accent's shares (representing 99.6 per cent. of the total number

<<<

 of shares in the Issuer) and all other securities and instruments in the Issuer (the "Share Transfer"). Closing of the Share Transfer is conditional upon that the Holders consent to the Share Transfer prior to 31 January 2017 and that approval

<<<

 is received in relation to Off The Shelf acceding as party to the Intercreditor Agreement in respect to the Remaining Mezzanine Loan (the "Intercreditor Approval"). Such approval will be granted by the Security Agent under the Bonds, being

<<<

 the Agent.
As part of the Restructuring, Off The Shelf has also undertaken to, in connection with closing of the Share Transfer, in favour of the Holders (represented by the Agent), pledge all shares and all other securities and instruments

<<<

 in the Issuer, directly or indirectly held by Dani Evanoff, as security for the fulfilment of Off The Shelf s obligations in relation to the contemplated Restructuring (the "Pledge").
The discussions on the Restructuring are still ongoing and

<<<

 the details regarding the process are confidential. No further information may therefore be disclosed at the moment, but will be announced within short. Later on, the further steps of the Restructuring will also be presented to the Holders

<<<

 for their approval.
According to the Terms and Conditions, the occurrence of an event whereby (i) AccentTwo Holding Limited and EQT, acting in concert, cease to control the Issuer, or (ii) one or more persons, not being EQT (or an Affiliate

<<<

 of EQT), acting in concert, acquire control over the Issuer, constitutes a Change of Control Event. In accordance with Section 10.4 (Mandatory Repurchase due to a Change o f Control Event) of the Terms and Conditions, upon a Change of Control

<<<

 Event, each Holder has a right to request that all, or only some, of its Bonds are repurchased at a price per Bond equal to 101.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. In order to finalise the Share Transfer

<<<

, the Holders must resolve to waive certain conditions in the Terms and Conditions to the effect that the Share Transfer may be carried out without this constituting a Change of Control Event.
As a consequence of the Share Transfer (if approved

<<<

 by the Holders), certain provisions of the Terms and Conditions will become obsolete. The Holders are therefore further requested to approve certain consequential amendments to the Terms and Conditions, to
2 (6)

the effect that certain definitions

<<<

 will no longer be related to AccentTwo Holding Limited or EQT.
The Committee has communicated to the Agent that Holders representing approximately 62.8 per cent. of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount will vote in favour of the Requests (as defined

<<<

 below).
2. Requests
In order to finalise the Share Transfer, the Holders are hereby requested to waive certain terms of the Terms and Conditions in accordance with Section 2.1 below (the "Waivers") and agree to amend the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 as specified in Section 2.2 below (the "Amendments"). The Amendments have been approved by the Issuer. The Waivers and the Amendments are jointly referred to as the "Requests".
The Holders' approval of the Requests shall constitute a required

<<<

 waiver in relation to any Event of Default or any breach of the Issuer's obligations under the Terms and Conditions, which could otherwise occur due to the implementation of the Requests.
2.1 Waivers
The Holders are hereby requested to resolve

<<<

 as follows.
Regardless of what is stated in the Terms and Conditions, Accent shall be permitted to transfer all of Accent's shares and other securities and instruments in the Issuer to a company wholly owned by Dani Evanoff, without this transaction

<<<

 constituting a Change of Control Event. For the avoidance of doubt, this transaction shall thus not lead to a right for the Holders to have their Bonds repurchased by the Issuer in accordance with Section 10.4 (Mandatory Repurchase due to a

<<<

 Change o f Control Event) of the Terms and Conditions.
2.2 Amendments
The Holders are hereby requested to approve the amendments to the Terms and Conditions set out below. In the below, blue and underlined text indicates additions whereas red

<<<

 and crossed-out text indicates removals.
1.1 Definitions
"Change of Control Event" means the occurrence of an event or series of events whereby (i) Dani Evanoff the Parents (acting in concert) cease to control the Issuer (for the avoidance

<<<

 of doubt, it being understood that any Parent may control the Issuer itself) or (ii) one or more persons, not being EQT (or an Affiliate of EQT), acting in concert, acquire control over the Issuer.
For the purpose of this definition, "control

<<<

" means (a) acquiring or controlling, directly or indirectly, more than fifty (50) per cent. of the voting shares of the Issuer, or (b) the right to, directly or indirectly, appoint or remove the whole or a majority of the directors of the board

<<<

 of directors of the Issuer, and "acting in concert" means a group of persons who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal), actively co-operate, through the acquisition directly or indirectly of shares in the Issuer

<<<

 by any of them, either directly or indirectly, to obtain or consolidate control of the Issuer.
3 (6)

"Parents" means AccentTwo Holding Limited, with registered office at Lime Grove House Green Street St Helier Jersey JE1 2ST, and EQT.
2.

<<<

3 Effective Date
The Waivers shall take effect on 4 January 2017, provided that (i) a sufficient majority has been obtained, (ii) the Intercreditor Approval has been received and (iii) a pledge agreement has been entered into, according to which

<<<

 the Pledge will be effected immediately after closing of the Share Transfer. If items (i)--(iii) have not been fulfilled on 4 January 2017, the effective date shall be postponed until items (i)--(iii) have been fulfilled. However, if items

<<<

 (i)--(iii) have not been fulfilled prior to 31 January 2017, the Waivers shall expire.
The Amendments shall take effect immediately after closing of the Share Transfer, i.e. when all of Accent's shares and all other securities and instruments

<<<

 in the Issuer have been transferred to Off The Shelf.
3. Conditions
It is acknowledged that the consent by the Holders to the Requests is subject to that each of the Waivers and the Amendments are approved.
4. Consent
The Holders are hereby

<<<

 asked to, subject to Section 3 above, agree to the Requests.
5. Written Procedure
The following instructions need to be adhered to under the Written Procedure.
5.1 Final date to participate in the Written Procedure
The Agent must have received

<<<

 the votes by mail, courier or email to the address indicated below no later than 17:00 (CET), 17 January 2017. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.
5.2 Decision procedure
The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to

<<<

 participate under the Written Procedure as valid votes.
When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent, the Requests shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies

<<<

 in the Written Procedure has not yet expired. As the Agent, when issuing this Notice, has been informed that Committee members representing approximately 62.8 per cent. of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount will vote in favour of the Requests

<<<

, the Agent deems it probable that the Written Procedure will be terminated before the expiry of the time period for replies.
Information about the decision(s) taken under the Written Procedure will (i) be sent by notice to the Holders and 

<<<

(ii) be published on the websites of (a) the Issuer and (b) the Agent.
4 (6)

A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Holders, irrespective of them responding in the Written Procedure or not.
5.3 Voting rights and

<<<

 authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (27 December 2016) in the debt register:
(a) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities Account; or
(b) be registered as authorised

<<<

 nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.
5.4 Bonds registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary

<<<

, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power

<<<

 of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the

<<<

 intermediary that is registered in the debt register as holder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a holder of the Securities

<<<

 Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and

<<<

 the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do

<<<

 not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or their Affiliates do not entitle to any voting rights.
5.5 Quorum
To approve the Requests, Holders

<<<

 representing at least twenty (20.00) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the Requests under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.
If a quorum does not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure

<<<

, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Holders initiating the procedure. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure.
5 (6)

5.6 Majority Fifty (50) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount

<<<

 for which Holders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to the Requests.
5.7 Address for sending replies Return the Voting Form, Schedule 1, and, if applicable, the Power of Attorney/Authorisation in Schedule 2 or other sufficient

<<<
