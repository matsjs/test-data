 Senior Secured Callable and Putable Bond Issue 2007/2012

Oslo, 16 December 2008

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Amendment of Loan Agreement
1. Introduction
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" or the "Trustee") acts as Loan Trustee for the loan

<<<

 mentioned above (the "Loan") where Cecon ASA and its subsidiaries Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 is the borrower and/or guarantor (the "Borrower" or the "Company").
All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings

<<<

 assigned thereto in the agreement for the Loan (the "Loan Agreement").
2. Background
On 5 November 2008, Cecon announced that it was not able to pay the semi-annual interest payment due on November 4th 2008. However, the Company informed the

<<<

 Trustee that it was in negotiations with an industrial investor for a solution which was expected to constitute a major step in the refinancing of Davie Yards, and that the company believed that this would be essential in order to resume normal

<<<

 operations at the yard, and hence for Cecon.
On this basis the Company was given a waiver to postpone this interest payment until December
1 9 th.
With reference to the press release on December 8th, Cecon announced that it has entered into

<<<

 a Heads of Agreement with Bergen Group ASA to secure delivery of Cecon's vessels under construction at Davie Yards in Canada. As part of the agreement, the two parties will establish a Newco which will invest USDm 10 in Davie Yards. An agreement

<<<

 has also been made between Newco and Davie Yards for the terms of this investment.
The delay in closing the agreement with the industrial investor had several implications, most importantly that no commitment on refund guarantees from EDC could

<<<

 be issued before the industrial investor was in place, and hence, Cecon could not start any financing activities.
The agreement with Bergen Group is subject to, among others, the provision of refund guarantees from EDC ensuring that the Company

<<<

 can draw on its existing USD 200 million senior bank facility. Following the agreement with Bergen Group, these guarantees are expected to be given within 19 December.

N O RSK TILLITSM ANN ASA

As previously communicated, following Davie's Q2 financial report

<<<

, Cecon has repaid a bridge loan used to finance a USDm 14.4 installment, as well as paid partial installments of a total of approx. USDm 4, both of which were taken from the company's working cash. Following the issuance of refund guarantees

<<<

 for these amounts, Cecon expects to draw on debt facilities for these installments, which will restore working capital by approx. USDm 20 and enable the company to pay interest on the bond loan and resume normal operations.
The company currently

<<<

 has short-term payables of approx. USDm 8.067 (excluding the coupon on the bond loan) and short-term receivables of approx. USDm 8.292. Remaining payments on the three vessels ordered amounts to USDm 232.72, of which USDm 200 is covered by

<<<

 the DnBNOR facility.
For the hulls related to the Loan the outstanding amount to be paid is USDm 131.98 whereof USDm 79.560 is expected to be covered by refund guarantees. The outstanding amount will be covered by the DnbNOR first loan of which

<<<

 USDm 130 is allocated for the two first vessels (i.e. the vessels financed by the Loan). USDm 1.98 is to be paid on final installment from the Company's working capital. A partial payment of USDm 4 has already been made, and when the bankfinancing

<<<

 is released, the working capital will be strengthened by this amount. The Company will not require refund guarantees for the final installments of USDm 52.42, which for each vessel is made up o f the original final installment of USDm 13.2

<<<

6 and the accepted price escalation of USDm 12.95. The refund guarantee expires at final installment for each vessel.
The outstanding amount on the third vessel is USDm 100.74 whereof USDm 79.42 is expected to be covered by refund guarantees

<<<

. Included in the refund guarantee is USDm 14.44 which is already paid to the yard. When financing is released this amount will be available as working capital.
The Company furthermore expects to generate a positive operating cash flow during

<<<

 2009. However, the Company will need to raise equity from shareholders to cover expenditures required to establish Newco, and additional financing to cover the gap between the outstanding payments to the yard and the first loan (bank loan)

<<<

.
The current cash balance of the Company is currently insufficient to pay interest due under the Loan, but the Company has through the Bergen Group agreement established a roadmap for restoring working cash to enable paying the interest coupon

<<<

 on February 4th once the refinancing has been completed. Cecon is therefore proposing the following amendments of the Loan Agreement (the "Proposal");
(1) Re. Interest Payment due December 2008
Unpaid interest due December 19th (the "Due Interest

<<<

 Amount") shall bear overdue interest equal to the original coupon plus 5% p.a. The Due Interest Amount (including overdue interest) falls due no later than 5th February 2009.
