Oslo, 25 February 2016
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the abovementioned bond issue of USD 300 million issued by Sanjel Corporation (the

<<<

 "Issuer") and guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries, which is documented in a bond agreement dated 18 June 2014 (as amended, amended and restated and supplemented from time to time, the "Bond Agreement") between the Issuer and the Bond

<<<

 Trustee, as trustee on behalf of the Bondholders.
Capitalised terms used in this summons and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Bond Agreement.
The Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability

<<<

 whatsoever related to the information in this summons.
1. BACKGROUND
The Issuer was in breach of certain financial covenants under both its senior secured Revolving Credit Facility and under the Bond Agreement as at 31 October 2015 and the

<<<

 Issuer did not pay the semi-annual interest payment on the Bonds of USD 11,250,000 due on 21 December 2015 (the "Defaults"). The breach remains unremedied. As a consequence of the Defaults, the Bond Trustee may, pursuant to the applicable provisions

<<<

 of Clause 15 of the Bond Agreement, declare the Bonds to be in default and due for immediate payment.
The Issuer has presented a forbearance agreement (the "Standstill Arrangements") which provides for a "standstill" or forbearance period during

<<<

 which the Bondholders will agree not to exercise or enforce any default related rights or remedies with respect to various past or prospective default events (being the Covered Events as defined below), pursuant to the Bond Agreement or any

<<<

 other Finance Document or otherwise in respect of the Bonds. The Standstill Arrangements will terminate on 15 June 2016, subject to earlier termination in certain circumstances.
The Issuer has also presented an amending agreement (the "Secured

<<<

 Lender Agreement") with the administrative agent and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, the "Secured Lenders") to effect certain amendments to the Revolving Credit Facility and includes an agreement by the Secured Lenders

<<<

 to forbear from exercising any rights and remedies under the Revolving Credit Facility and related loan documents against the Issuer and other loan parties with respect to various past or prospective default events. The agreed "standstill"

<<<

 or forbearance period with the Secured Lenders will run until 30 April 2016, subject to earlier termination in certain circumstances. A condition precedent to the Secured Lender Agreement is execution of the Standstill Arrangements by Bondholders

<<<

 holding not less than 66 2/3% of the outstanding Bonds.
