Re: Pemex Press Release

Dear Mr. White

:

As you know, we represent an ad hoc group o f holders (the "A d Hoc Group") representing approximately 50% o f the 7.50% Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2019 (the "Bonds"") issued by Oro N egro Drilling Pte. Ltd. (collectively with Integradora

 de Servicios Petroleros Oro N egro S.A.P.I. de C.V. and its respective subsidiaries and affiliates, the " Company"").

The A d H oc Group has reviewed the Company

<<<

' s recent release on Stamdata, dated August 28, 2017, announcing the Company' s proposal for a comprehensive restructuring o f the Bonds (the " Company Proposal"). The Company Proposal is not a viable restructuring proposal as there is no justification

<<<

 for holders of the Bonds to undertake a material debt for equity conversion given the Company' s current financial and operational condition, including the A d H oc Group' s support for the latest proposal o f Petroleos Mexicanos ("Pemex""

<<<

) concerning certain amendments to the drilling contracts
between the Company and Pemex for the Primus, Laurus, Fortius, Decus, and Impetus
rigs (the "Pemex Proposal").
Accordingly, in an effort to advance discussions towards a realistic solution

<<<

 that benefits all o f the Company' s stakeholders, the A d Hoc Group attaches hereto a copy o f the Term Sheet referenced in last w eek' s " Letter from the bondholder group to the Issuer," which Nordic Trustee A S A posted to Stamdata on behalf

<<<

 o f the group on August 23, 2017 (the "Bondholder Proposal"). As the A d Hoc Group explained in its prior letter to the Company, the A d Hoc Group believes the Bondholder Proposal w ill allow the Company to implement the Pemex Proposal while

<<<

 maintaining the uninterrupted operational performance o f the affected drilling rigs.
Although the Company received the Bondholder Proposal over two weeks ago, the Ad Hoc Group has not had any meaningful engagement with the Company before the

<<<

 announcement o f the Company Proposal. Notwithstanding this lack o f engagement, the A d H oc Group remains ready and willing to engage with the Company and its stakeholders on a consensual restructuring. The A d Hoc Group is committed to a

<<<

 restructuring that w ill ensure the continuous and safe operation o f the Company' s rigs, and minimize the economic impact on all o f the Company' s stakeholders.
Sincerely,
