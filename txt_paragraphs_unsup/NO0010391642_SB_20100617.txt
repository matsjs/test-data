A. the maximum amount of Preferred Senior Debt - (being obligations

C. a third priority mortgage over the FPSO together with a third priority assignment of

 insurances be granted in favour of E.ON as security for actual and contingent liabilities, in each case ranking behind the interests of the Bondholders, provided, however, that E.ON (subject to coordination arrangements between the bank lenders

 and E.ON) may be granted a better ranking priority security interest over the FPSO and its insurances within the maximum amount of the Preferred Senior Debt if and to the extent E.ON elects to fund the project in an event where the bank lender

D. in the event the Company (or relevant subsidiary) is in default under the terms of the Bank Facility and/or the Loan Agreement, and fails to remedy such breach within any applicable grace period, E.ON

 at Maturity Date at 105.00% of par value.
I. the coupon Margin is increased from 5.50 percentage points to 10.00 percentage points with effect from the Effective Date
3.1 The Company's evaluation
In the Company's opinion, the new Charter Contract

<<<

 is clearly positive and represents an attractive opportunity for the Company and the Bondholders. The fact that the FPSO was selected by E.ON for the Huntington field demonstrates that the Sevan technology and concept is now accepted by first

<<<

 class operators even in harsh environments. This bodes well for the Company and its stakeholders going forward.
If the Proposal were to be turned down, the FPSO would be without employment from the imminent expiry of the Current Contract. Alternative

<<<

 chartering opportunities take time to identify and conclude. The cost coverage offered under the Charter Contract from termination at the Shelley Field until commencement at the Huntington field is attractive in itself, and supreme relative

<<<

 to the alternative.
The estimated EBITDA from the Charter Contract will be -USD 75 million per year. The Company considers this to be a strong charter contract, and the solid cash flow underlines the significant asset values that the Company

<<<

's FPSOs represents in general and this FPSO in particular.
The accumulated dividend capacity of -USD 113 million from the FPSO Subsidiary to the Company during the firm period of the Charter Contract should, in itself, make the refinancing

<<<

 of the Bond Issue (which will be NOK 545 million / -USD 90 million at final Maturity Date in October 2012) manageable.
The Company holds the view that the increased EBITDA contribution from the Charter Contract supports the increased leverage

<<<

 of USD 80 million, and that Bondholders should be at least equally or better off under the new capital structure, compared to the existing capital structure in a scenario where the FPSO would have been un-contracted from Q3 2010.
The Charter

<<<

 Contract is subject to the financing of the relevant upgrades and investments being in place. The Company believes the Bank Facility provides for excellent terms in today's financial market, and that the Charter Contract in combination with

<<<

 the Bank Facility on the conditions proposed constitute opportunities which are in the best interest of all stakeholders, including those of the Bondholders.

If the financial and technical conditiohS 'fo'rthc

<<<

 E.ON Charter Contract are not satisfied within 30 June 2010, the Letter of Intent with E.ON will expire.
The requirements of E.ON reflect the critical nature of the FPSO's availability relative to the plans and commitments in the Huntington

<<<

 project. From a creditor perspective, the rights required by E.ON should be regarded as adding certainty that the project will be executed and delivered according to plan. The purchase option required by E.ON can be seen as potentially providing

<<<

 additional protection to the creditors.
Under the Existing Senior Debt (as defined in the Company Update), the bank lenders have (as is customary) given quiet enjoyment undertakings in favor of the charterer under the Current Contract. In exchange

<<<

 for a direct undertaking even by the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), a second priority assignment of earnings (which is not provided under the current structure) will be granted to the Bondholders, thus improving the security package

<<<

. The restrictive nature of the coordination agreement basically reflect the fact that the Preferred Senior Debt ranks with better priority, except that the potential access to cashflows in case of delayed enforcement (and assuming contractual

<<<

 performance by E.ON) provides an improvement and some security.
The Company considers the Proposal to be very attractive for investors. The Company recognizes that Bondholders demand a compensation for the increased carve-out. In the Company

<<<

's opinion, a new Margin as offered under paragraph "I" in the Proposal chapter represents a very solid compensation to Bondholders. The increased redemption price as described under paragraph "H" in the Proposal should also be attractive for

<<<

 investors.
The Company emphasizes that the Charter Contract is jeopardized if the Company is not able to get acceptance from the Bondholders on these terms. In such scenario, the FPSO will be unemployed from 3Q 2010.
The Company has engaged

<<<

 Pareto Securities AS as the Company's financial advisor (the "Advisor") with respect to the Proposal. Accordingly, Bondholders may contact Pareto Securities AS Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70 for further information. The Advisor is acting

<<<

 solely for the Company and no-one else in connection with the Proposal. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by the Advisor with respect to the Company and the Advisor expressly disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in

<<<

 connection with the Proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein).
For further information about the Company, please visit the Company's website www.sevanmarine.com.
3.2 Norsk Tillitsmann's evaluation
The Proposal

<<<

 is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel

<<<

 from their legal and financial advisers regarding the effect of the Proposal.

Company Proposal Memo
(Terms defined in the summons letter from Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 to the Bondholders dated 1 7 June 2010 or in the Loan Agreement shall have the same meaning herein unless otherwise stated)

1. BACKGROUND FOR THE PROPOSAL
On 30 April 2010 the Company, on behalf of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, and E

<<<

.ON, as operator on behalf of the Huntington field owners, entered into a Letter of Intent whereby they agreed to progress negotiations on a charter party for the potential use of the FPSO as the production unit for the Huntington Field in block

<<<

 22/14 on the UK continental shelf. These negotiations take place on a mutually exclusive basis up to June 30, 2010, during which period certain technical and financing conditions need to be satisfied.
The proposed charter contract (the "Charter

<<<

 Contract") will be for a firm fixed term of five years with extension options for the Huntington owners. The estimated contract value is approximately USD 535 million for the fixed period. Expected start-up under the Charter Contract is 4Q

<<<

 2011.
The Charter Contract requires certain necessary upgrades and investment to be made in the topside module on the FPSO at a total cost of approximately USD 90 million. The resulting increase in capacities and capabilities will increase

<<<

 the value of the FPSO and significantly improve the earnings potential and the cash flow from the unit.
The Company and ING Bank N.Y. have agreed on a term sheet which is subject to final credit approval and loan documentation for a secured

<<<

 bank facility of USD 230 million (the "Bank Facility"). This Bank Facility is intended to replace the current USD 105 million and USD 45 million of 1st lien bank and bond loan (together the "Existing Senior Debt"), secured by, inter alia, the

<<<

 FPSO. In addition, the Bank Facility will, together with an equity contribution of USD 10 million by the Company, provide Sevan 300 Pte Ltd (the "Owner") (being the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary which owns the FPSO) with the necessary funding

<<<

 to complete the required upgrading of and investments in the FPSO.
The Bank Facility will have a 5 year linear repayment schedule, an interest rate at LIBOR + a margin of 4% up to E.ON's acceptance of the FPSO under the Charter Contract, and

<<<

 thereafter a margin of 2.5%. The Bank Facility will be secured on first priority by collateral in all available assets relating to the FPSO and the Charter Contract.
ING Bank N.V. as well as E.ON require certain conditions to be fulfilled in

<<<

 order to enter into definitive agreements, some of which impact the Loan Agreement.

2. EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSAL

The FPSO is currently contracted to Premier Oil for operation on the Shelley Field in the UK sector of the North Sea. The Shelley

<<<

 Field is scheduled for decommissioning at the end of July 2010 due to the field nearing end of life. Absent a new contract, the FPSO would have to be laid up, with resulting costs accruing and loss of income.

Under the terms of the Charter Contract, E.ON will cover the cost of mobilizing the FPSO and its mooring system from the Shelley Field to the Huntington Field, hook-up costs at the Huntington Field, and opex

 relating to the FPSO until commencement of operations under the Charter Contract.

During the interim period between the expiry of the Current Contract and start-up under the Charter Contract, the FPSO will be upgraded with gas injection to

<<<

 serve the Huntington field. The upgrade will take place at a European yard to be selected shortly.

The Charter Contract will generate an average annual EBITDA, available for service of debt (interest and repayments) of approx. USD 75 million

<<<

 of which approx. USD 50 million will be allocated to serve the first priority collateral annually in average. The annual operating cash flow, as well as annual dividend capacity from the Owner to the Company is shown below. Furthermore, the

E.ON pursues an aggressive timeline for the Huntington project, and requires certainty both that the FPSO will be delivered in a timely fashion and that it remains available to it for

<<<

 the term of the Charter Contract. The Company and E.ON have therefore agreed to certain measures that will add certainty for the project being executed and delivered according to plan:
E.ON will be provided with step-in rights in equipment

<<<

 supply and yard contracts relative to the upgrading so as to be able to complete the works for its own account in the unlikely event that relevant Sevan entities were unable to complete the works. For the same reason, E.ON will have step-in

<<<

 rights in the management agreement with Wood Group during the operational stage. Correspondingly, E.ON requires that the bank lenders as well as Norsk Tillitsmann (on behalf of the bondholders) provide quiet enjoyment undertakings in E.ON's

<<<

 favor in customary formats to ensure the quiet, peaceful and uninterrupted use of the FPSO as long as E.ON performs its obligations under the Charter Contract. E.ON also requires the right to make available to the Owner any part of the Bank

<<<

 Facility which the banks may not advance. In return, E.ON expects to rank pari passu as Preferred Senior Debt for any such amounts it may advance within the total maximum amount of USD 230 million (plus related costs, interest and any interest

<<<

 swap liabilities relating thereto up to 75% of the interest liabilities under the Preferred Senior Debt). If advances from E.ON, together with the advances made by the banks, exceed USD 230 million, any such E.ON excess amount will be secured

<<<

 by the third priority mortgage.

As security for any claims E.ON may get against Sevan entities under or in connection with the Charter Contract, a third priority mortgage and assignment

 of insurances - ranking after the Bank Facility and the Bond - is required.

The Preferred Senior Debt will mature in 2016, with amortization of USD 12.1 million per quarter, starting 6 months after the FPSO having been accepted by E.ON under

<<<

 the terms of the Charter Contract. First amortization is therefore expected to take place in March 2012, with final maturity date on or about 31st December 2016. Thus, the maturity profile for the Preferred Senior Debt is pushed forward compared

<<<

 to the Existing Senior Debt which matures in 2014. The actual refinancing of the Existing Senior Debt is scheduled to take place in Q4 2010.
