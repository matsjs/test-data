 Bond Issue 2007/2012 with Warrants
Oslo, 13 November 2008
REQUEST FOR AMENDMENT OF THE LOAN AGREEMENTSUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned Bond issue (the "Loan"), where Biofuel

<<<

 Energy ASA is the borrower (the "Borrower"). All capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement dated 6 June 2007 (the "Loan Agreement '') or in this summons.
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to

<<<

 convene a Bondholders' meeting to amend the Loan Agreement so that the so called Urnoe group with related persons and companies to be considered the dominating owner of Biofuel with regards to the Change of Control clauses. Further it is proposed

<<<

 to lift the restrictions on upstream intra group loans to enable the Borrower to service the Loan and cover other expenditures made in the ordinary course of business. Further it is proposed to release the pledge over, and sell, a piece of

<<<

 land owned by the Project Company, which is no longer needed for the purpose for which it is was acquired.
CHANGE OF CONTROL CLAUSES
The Borrower has incurred substantial overruns on the forecasted capital expenditures to complete the Project

<<<

 and required an additional NOK 500,000,000 to fund the remaining payment obligations arising under the EPC Contract (as defined in the Loan Agreement) as well as for other working capital needs through October of 2008 (the "Funding Requirement

<<<

").
The Borrower has raised additional funding of NOK 500,000,000 through bridge loans (the "Bridge Loans") extended directly to Destilaria Paranapanema S.A (the "Project Company") by the Borrower's majority shareholder, Umoe Invest AS ("UMQE

<<<

"). The Bridge Loans are secured by a first priority lien over the sugar cane assets of the Project Company.
The Borrower proposes a repayment of the Bridge Loans through a payment in kind with shares in the Borrower. The issuance of 47,333

<<<

,775 new shares for repayment of the Bridge Loans (the "Tranche 1 Offering"), shall be followed by an offering to all other shareholders and warrantholders (the "Tranche 2 Offering").

The Tranche 2 Offering will consist of up to 24,000,000 new

<<<

 shares being offered at NOK 11 on a pro rata basis to the shareholders not comprised by the Tranche 1 Offering, and the warrantholders.
The Tranche 1 Offering and the Tranche 2 Offering were approved by the Extraordinary General Meeting of

<<<

 the Borrower held 22 October 2008 subject to the approval by the bondholders of amendments to the Change of Control clauses of the Loan Agreement, as further explained below.
Pursuant to the waiver granted by the Bondholders' Meeting held 

<<<

16 May 2008, UMOE ownership of up to 76% of the shares in the Borrower shall not be considered a Change of Control Event that triggers a Put Option for the Bondholders. The Tranche 1 Offering would, if no other shareholders or any warrantholders

<<<

 participate in the Tranche 2 Offering, bring UMOE's ownership share in the Borrower to approximately 86%, which is significantly above the permitted ownership level and would, therefore, trigger a Put Option for the Bondholders. As a Put Option

<<<

 would defeat the purpose of the Bridge Loans, the Borrower proposes to amend the Change of Control clauses in a manner that recognizes UMOE as the new majority owner. If the proposal is adopted, a Change of Control Event is constituted by shareholders

<<<

 other than UMOE, Jens Ulltveit- Moe or companies controlled by him or his immediate family, gaining the right to cast more than 50 per cent of the votes in a general meeting of the Borrower.
UPSTREAM LOANS
The Borrower holds 100% of the shares

<<<

 in Christiania Bioenergia Participacoes S.A. (the "Holding Company") (except for four (4) shares held by the Holding Company's directors as required under Brazilian law). The Holding Company in turn holds 100% of the Shares in the Project Company

<<<

.
The Borrower has no assets of its own except for the indirect ownership in the Project Company. The proceeds of the Loan as well as the proceeds from certain equity issues of the Borrower have been transferred as loans or equity down to the

<<<

 Holding Company and subsequently as equity down to the Project Company. The Project Company is expected to generate the cash necessary for the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Loan Agreement.
The Project Company could, when it

<<<

 has distributable profits, declare and pay dividends to the Holding Company, which could then in turn either repay certain Intra-Group Loans to the Borrower or declare and pay dividends to the Borrower. However, the Project Company is not expected

<<<

 to generate sufficient distributable profits (as distinct from free cashflow) in a timely manner to permit the Borrower to service its payment obligations under the Loan Agreement and to meet other expenditures of the Borrower in the ordinary

<<<

 course of its business.
The Loan Agreement does not provide for upstream loans to permit cash from the Project Company or the Holding Company to be lent up to the Borrower. This restriction effectively prevents the Borrower from accessing cashflow

<<<

 from operations needed by the Borrower to service interest payments / fee payments on the Loan as well as to pay other expenditures incurred by the Borrower in the ordinary course of business.
The Borrower proposes amendments to the Loan Agreement

<<<

 to allow the Project Company to extend loans to the Holding Company as well as to the Borrower, and to allow the Holding
2

NORSK. T ILLITSM A N N ASA
Company to extend loans to the Borrower. The receivables arising under such upstream intra

<<<

 group loans shall be pledged on first priority in favor of the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), as currently provided for under Section 8.2(c) of the Loan Agreement.
RELEASE OF PLEDGE
In 2007, the Project Company acquired a land

<<<

 parcel of approximately 98.6 hectares from the Jacintho family (the "Jacintho Land") as the intended location of the second distillery ("Unit 2").
According to the Borrower, the Project Company currently owns in the aggregate approximately

<<<

 2700 hectares of land. The Jacintho Land, therefore, represents less than 4 per cent of the land assets.
The Project Company decided at a later time not to construct Unit 2 on the Jacintho Land, but in a different location approximately IT

<<<

 kilometer from the Jacintho Land and also on land purchased by the Project Company for the Project. Consequently, the Project Company considers selling the Jacintho Land back to its original owners, who are important sugar cane producers and

<<<

 suppliers to the Project Company for the Project. As the Jacintho Land is no longer needed for the original purpose, the Project Company considers that the funds tied up in the asset could be used more productively, for the benefit of shareholders

<<<

 and Bondholders, if the asset is sold.
The Jacintho Land is currently pledged as security for the Loan, in accordance with the Loan Agreement's clauses requiring that the Loan shall be secured partly by a first priority Lien over the land where

<<<

 the second distillery will be / is erected, and by a first priority lien in all land directly owned by the Project Company.
Further, the Loan Agreement places restrictions on the Project Company's right to sell the Jacintho Land as it is part

<<<

 of the Loan Security.
The Borrower proposes that the Bondholders release the pledge over the Jacintho Land, and consent to a sale of the Jacintho Land.
BONDHOLDERS' MEETING:
To enable the Borrower and Loan Trustee to agree amendments to, and

<<<

 to waive certain provisions of, the Loan Agreement, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes.
In the opinion of the Loan Trustees, a formal recognition of

<<<

 UMOE's current role as majority shareholder will enable UMOE to exercise its ownership responsibilities, and also allow UMOE to capitalise the Borrower without being restricted by the Loan Agreement, which should be in the interest of the Bondholders

<<<

. Further, facilitating the upstream intra group loans to enable the Borrower to service the Loan etc, should also be in the interest of the Bondholders. Regarding the sale of the Jacintho Land, it seems that selling the land which is not needed

<<<

 for its original purpose allows for a more efficient use of the Project Company's funds, although the Loan Security is reduced. The reduction seems to be modest as the Jacintho Land represents less than 4% of the Project Company's land assets

<<<

 by area. All things considered the proposed amendments / waivers should, in the opinion of the Loan Trustee, be

NO RSK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA

<<<

 the information given from the company, whether the proposed amendments/ waivers should be accepted.
