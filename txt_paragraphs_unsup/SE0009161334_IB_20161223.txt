 19(c) of the Terms and Conditions.
We hereby inform you that we, in our capacity as Agent, have agreed to amend the definition "Final Maturity Date" set out in Clause 1.1 of the Terms and Conditions to read as follows:
"Final Maturity Date

" means 3 May 2020.
Our approval of the amendment is made in accordance with Clause 19(a)(ii) of the Terms and Conditions, since the amendment is made solely for the purpose of rectifying an obvious error of the definition Final Maturity Date
