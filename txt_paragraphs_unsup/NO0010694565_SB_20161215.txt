 Secured Callable Bond Issue (the "Bonds")

Oslo, 15 December 2016

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

We refer to the bond agreement dated 27 November 2013 (as amended) for the bond issue, ISIN NO 001 069456, USD 150,000,000, 7.75 per cent World

<<<

 Wide Supply AS 13/17 Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue (the "Bond Agreement") between World Wide Supply AS (the "Issuer") and Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") on behalf of the Bondholders (as defined in the Bond Agreement). All capitalised

<<<

 terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement.

This summons is being issued at the request of Bondholders holding more than 50% of the Outstanding Bonds (the "Instructing Bondholders"

<<<

).

The information in this summons and the Proposal (as defined below) is provided by the Instructing Bondholders, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

ATT. BONDHOLDERS ARE MADE AWARE

<<<

 THAT A DEADLINE FOR REQUESTING NON-BINDING INFORMATION ABOUT A SHARE ISSUE AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 3 BELOW EXPIRES ON 22 DECEMBER 2016 AT 13.00 CET. PLEASE SEE SECTION 3 BELOW FOR DETAILS. UNLESS INFORMATION IS REQUESTED WITHIN SUCH DATE, THE

<<<

 OPPORTUNITY TO SUBSCRIBE FOR SHARES IS FORFEITED. THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS NON-BINDING.

1.

BACKGROUND

The Issuer, through its Subsidiaries (together the "Group"), owns six platform supply vessels (the "Vessels"), the World Diamond

<<<

, the World Emerald, the World Opal, the World Pearl, the World Peridot and the World Sapphire.

On 28 December 2015 WWS Recovery AS ( "Holdings") acquired all the outstanding shares in the Issuer, in accordance with the resolutions passed at

<<<

 the Bondholders' Meeting held on 6 January 2016. This acquisition was financed by the issuance of a bond, ISIN NO 001 0754765, USD 5,000,000 18 per cent WWS Recovery AS (the "Super-priority Bond").

At the time of the acquisition of the Issuer

<<<

 by Holdings, four of the Vessels were in lay up in western Norway and two were contracted to Petrobras. On 31 August 2016 and 10 October 2016, World Emerald and World Sapphire respectively were redelivered from Petrobras and are now in lay

<<<

 up in Cadiz, Spain. As such there are currently no commercial operations in the Group.

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

The main costs of the Group are the lay up costs related to the Vessels, and

<<<

 general management costs in relation to the group entities. The Group has a complicated corporate structure including 27 legal entities, a number of which, including those owning the Vessels, are domicilied in the Netherlands. This structure

<<<

, is considered sub-optimal and not an efficient structure for long term ownership of the Vessels.

The cash balance of the Group is expected to be approximately USD 6.3 million at 31 December 2016. In addition, other than the Vessels, the Group

<<<

 has certain other assets, mainly consisting of a tax claim against the City of Rio de Janeiro in the approximate amount of BRL 11.5 million and a claim for unpaid charter hire from Petrobras for approximately USD 350,000, (the "Contingent Assets

<<<

"). Any recovery from the Contingent Assets as well as the timing and amount of any potential recovery from the Contingent Assets is uncertain and may require litigation in Brazilian courts. The tax claim is disputed by the City of Rio de Janeiro

<<<

 and is already the subject of litigation. Furthermore, the cash balance of Holdings is currently approximately USD 2.7 million.

The current structure is, as set out above, complicated, inefficient and consequently un-attractive to any potential

<<<

 purchasers in the current market. Furthermore, without new employment for the Vessels, the remaining cash in the Group will gradually be expended merely on lay-up costs for the Vessels and general management for the group entities.

The Issuer

<<<

 has not made any payments of interest since 26 August 2015 as required under Clause 12.1 (iCovenant to pay) of the Bond Agreement and is also in breach of other covenants under the Bond Agreement including, inter alia, (i) making the required

<<<

 payments to the Cash Retention Account as required under Clause 14.5(b) (Cash Retention Account) as such payments have not been made, (ii) ensuring that the Market Value of the Vessels exceed 120% of the Outstanding Bonds as required under

<<<

 Clause 14.11(a) (Asset Cover Ratio) as the Market Value clearly does not, (iii) ensuring that the Group (on a consolidated and 12 months rolling basis) maintains an Interest Coverage Ratio of minimum 110% from the fiscal quarter ending 30 June

<<<

 2015 and thereafter as required under Clause 14.11(b) (Interest Coverage Ratio) which it clearly does not, (iv) ensuring that the Group (on a consolidated basis) at all times maintains Liquidity of minimum USD 7,500,000 as required under Clause

<<<

 14.11(c) (Liquidity) which it does not (expected cash balance at 31 December 2016 being approximately USD 6,300,000) and (v) ensuring that the Group (on a consolidated basis) maintains a Market Adjusted Equity Ratio of minimum 30% as required

<<<

 under Clause 14.11(d) (Market Adjusted Equity Ratio), which it clearly does not.

The lack of payment of interest constitutes an Event of Default under Clause 16.1(a) (Non-payment) and the other listed breaches under (ii) to (v) above constitute

<<<

 Events of Default under Clause 16.1(b) (Breach o f other obligations).

2.

DECLARATION OF DEFAULT AND SALE OF THE VESSELS

In light of the above situation, the Instructing Bondholders propose that the Bond Trustee is instructed to (i) declare

<<<

 the Bonds to be in Default and (ii) request the Issuer to sell the Vessels to a new structure set up by Bondholders that wish to participate as set out below.

The Instructing Bondholders have informed the Bond Trustee that Bondholders holding

<<<

 60.7% of the Bonds have committed to voting in favor of the Proposal as set out below.

2

Proposed transaction

New World Supply Ltd. ("Newco"), a Cayman Island exempted company being set up by certain Bondholders, has offered to purchase

<<<

, through its subsidiaries, the Vessels en bloc on a "where is / as is basis", with minimal representations or warranties required on the part o f the sellers.

The Instructing Bondholders propose that, following a declaration of Default under

<<<

 the Bond Agreement, the Bond Trustee requests the Issuer to sell the six Vessels owned by it for a total price of USD 27,500,000 (the "Purchase Amount") to Newco, in line with the fleet valuation from NorOcean, an affiliate of Arctic Securities

<<<

, attached hereto as Schedule 1 (the "Transaction").

Upon completion of the sale, which will be settled in cash, the Mortgages on the Vesssels held by the Bond Trustee on behalf on the Bondholders shall be released. Should the Issuer not comply

<<<

 with the request to sell, the Bond Trustee shall summon a Bondholder's Meeting to decide whether the Mortgages held by the Bond Trustee over the Vessels shall be enforced. A resolution by a Bondholders' Meeting to enforce Security Interests

<<<

 requires, under the terms of the Bond Agreement, a simple majority of Voting Bonds to pass, and the Bond Trustee has been informed by the Instructing Bondholders, which hold more than a simple majority of the Bonds, that they would vote in

<<<

 favour of a proposal to enforce the Mortgages in such a case.

The sales proceeds from the Transaction shall be paid directly to the Bond Trustee as consideration for release of the mortgages. It is expected that shortly after the closing of

<<<

 the Transaction, the Bond Trustee will distribute the Purchase Amount (net of any fees and costs related to the Transaction). The Bond Trustee will, as required under an intercreditor agreement as set out in the summons to Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

 dated 17 December 2015 (the "Intercreditor Agreement"), firstly distribute the received proceeds to the bond trustee of the Super-priority Bond to cover all outstanding principal and interest in order to fully redeem the Super-priority Bonds

<<<

. Net o f the cash currently held by Holdings, the portion of the Purchase Amount expected to be used for redeeming the Super-priority Bonds is expected to be approximately USD 3.3 million plus accrued interest from 22 December 2016 until the

<<<

 repayment date. The balance of the proceeds, expected to be approximately USD 24.1 million, will be available for distribution to the Bondholders.

Following completion of the Transaction, there will be no commercial activities in the Group

<<<

. The Transaction will therefore put the Issuer in a position to be wound down in an orderly fashion, and distribute its remaining cash to its creditors, which is expected to mainly consist of the Bondholders. The winding down of the Group,

<<<

 the plan for dealing with the Contingent Assets and further distributions will be subject to the resolutions by the Bondholders' Meeting at a later date.

Should the Proposals not be approved by the Bondholders' Meeting, the Transaction will

<<<

 not proceed. In that event the structure of the Issuer will likely stay as is, and the Super-priority Bond will continue to accrue interest which will be payable ahead of any proceeds to the Bondholders in any future sales transaction and the

<<<

 Instructing Bondholders will evaluate future steps.

Completion of the Transaction will occur subsequent to the share issue described in Section 3 below and is expected to close by the end of January 2017, but timing remains subject to change

<<<

.

3.

PARTICIPATION IN NEW WORLD SUPPLY LTD.

Each Bondholder as of the date of the Bondholders' Meeting will be given the opportunity to participate in the share issue of Newco. No prospectus will be prepared for the issue of the shares in

<<<

 line with relevant exemptions from prospectus requirements, such as, inter alia, minimum

3

subscription amount in the USD equivalent of EUR 100,000. In the event that the share issue is oversubscribed, allocations, if permissible under the

<<<

 applicable exemptions from prospectus requirements, will be made pro-rata based on holdings o f the Bonds as o f the date o f the Bondholders' Meeting.
The initial capitalisation of Newco is expected to exceed the amount necessary to settle

<<<

 the Purchase Amount by at least USD 5,000,000 in order to ensure that Newco is properly funded for its operation going forward, so that initial share issue amount is expected to be at least USD 32,500,000. Because the company will be capitalized

<<<

 with more funds than the Purchase Amount and because part of the Purchase Amount will be used to repay the Super-priority Bonds, those Bondholders wishing to maintain the same ownership percentage of Newco that they hold in the Bonds will need

<<<

 to invest more funds than will be distributed to them in the period immediately following the Transaction. Furthermore, due to the timing of the Transaction, those investing will be required to fund Newco prior to receiving any distribution

<<<

 from the Bonds.
Newco is an exempted company incorporated under the laws o f the Cayman Islands. Bondholders under common management and holding 52.6% of the Bonds have declared their interest to participate in the subscription of shares in

<<<

 Newco and subsequently will receive at least 52.6% of the shares and voting rights in Newco. There is no intention to list the shares of Newco, there is no expectation that there will be any liquidity in the trade of Newco shares and no dividends

<<<

 or other distributions to shareholders from Newco are expected in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, in the future Newco may need to raise additional capital to fund its business. While Newco shareholders will have pre-emptive rights with

<<<

 respect to any equity offerings, should any shareholder choose not to participate, their ownership stake will be diluted and/or subordinated.
Any Bondholders that consider subscribing for shares in Newco must contact David Bulley of Appleby

<<<

 (Cayman) Ltd. by emailing dbulley@applebyglobal.com with a copy to snoly@bahr.no by no later than 13.00 CET on the day of the Bondholders' Meeting to request further information regarding the share subscription (the "Subscription Information

<<<

"). When requesting the Subscription Information each interested Bondholder must include proof of its holdings of Bonds as per a date no earlier than 5 Business Days before the Bondholders' Meeting and confirm the jurisdiction of the legal entity

<<<

 that would hold the shares on its behalf, should it choose to subscribe. The request for Subscription Information is non-binding.
Completed subscription documentation must be provided to David Bulley of Appleby (Cayman) Ltd. by emailing dbulley

<<<

@applebyglobal.com with a copy to snoly@bahr.no within 10 Business Days after the receipt by the subscriber of the Subcription Information.
The Subscription Information is expected to be provided within the first half of January 2017 and settlement

<<<

 of the share issue is expected to be completed by the end of January 2017, but timing remains subject to change. Allocation of shares will be made to participating Bondholders pro rata to their holdings of Bonds as of the date of the Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting and the share issue will be settled in cash only.
NOTHING IN THIS SUMMONS SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS AN OFFER TO PURCHASE SHARES OR ANY OTHER SECURITY.
