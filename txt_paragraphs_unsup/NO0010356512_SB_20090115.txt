 Shipping ASA Senior Unsecured Callable PIK Bond Issue 2007/2012 ISIN NO 001 035651.2
Oslo, 15 January 2009
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING - PROPOSED APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF FINANCIAL COVENANT REQUIREMENT
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed loan

<<<

 trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN NO001035651.2 (the "Loan") where American Shipping Company ASA (the "Borrower") is the issuer. (Prior to 21 July 2008 the registered name of the Borrower was Aker American Shipping ASA

<<<

).
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") entered into on 23 February, 2007 between the Borrower and the Loan Trustee, unless otherwise stated in this summons.
The

<<<

 Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders meeting to consider a request for consent to disregard, for a limited time, any effect o f any non cash gain or loss from the change in fair market value o f interest rate hedging

<<<

 agreements in connection with the equity covenant. Currently non-cash gains or losses from the periodic valuation (mark-to market) o f interest rate swap agreements influence the calculated Equity due to IFRS standards. Due to the market development

<<<

 (falling interest rates) the subsequent non-cash effect will cause the Equity o f the Borrower to be below requirements o f the Loan Agreement. The Borrower requests a consent which allows them to disregard the non-cash effects of such swap

<<<

 valuations when calculating Equity under the Loan Agreement clause 13.2 for the next four financial reporting periods.
Background
Pursuant to Clause 13.2 of the Loan Agreement the Borrower shall:
"based on the quarterly accounts (unless the

<<<

 Loan Trustee or the Bondholders ' meeting (as the case may be) in writing has agreed to otherwise) comply with the followingfinancial covenants:
(a) ensure that the Group maintains Equity o f more than USD 140 million. "

Pursuant

<<<

 to Clause 1 of the Loan Agreement, Equity is defined as
"the aggregate book value (on a consolidated) basis o f the Group's total equity in accordance with IFRS. "
According to the Borrower, it has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge

<<<

 the fluctuation of interest rate movements on its debt service. These interest rate swap instruments, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), are marked-to-market as of the last day of each reporting period. Consequently

<<<

, any resulting gains or losses from the change in fair market value of the hedge are non cash and unrealized and are recorded on the books and records of the Borrower through the income statement. Thus, the balance sheet impact is either an

<<<

 increase or decrease in equity. As of December 31, 2008, the mark-to-market valuation of those interest rate swap instruments was approximately USD 101 million in favour of the swap counterparty, of which approximately USD 58 million will be

<<<

 attributable to the fourth quarter income statement. As a result of the IFRS requirement, the consolidated group equity may be reduced below the minimum requirement of USD 140 million.
The interest rate swaps have been entered into to fix the

<<<

 interest rates under a USD 770 million loan facility in order to protect stakeholders against interest rate fluctuations. It was however not foreseen that the unprecedented volatility in the USD credit market would result in significant non

<<<

-cash, unrealised losses related to these interest rate swaps, particularly when such interest rate swaps have been entered into to protect investors against negative interest rate fluctuations.
The Proposal
The Borrower proposes that it shall

<<<

 be permitted, when computing Equity for the purpose of calculation in Clause 13.2 (a) for the next four financial quarters (the reporting periods ending on 31 December 2008 through and including the period ending on 30 September 2009), to disregard

<<<

 any non-cash gain or loss in the market value of any interest rate swaps in order for the accounts to reflect actual cash disbursements for interest hedging purposes. The change of the Equity calculation will furthermore allow the Borrower

<<<

 to disregard unforeseen non-cash adjustments to Equity resulting from market changes and thereby also provide a more accurate Equity position including the maintenance of the USD 140 million equity covenant.
An approval will avoid a possible

<<<

 technical breach under the Loan Agreement, which (according to the Borrower) might affect relationships between the Borrower and others who do not otherwise consider these unrealized, non-cash gains and losses as material to the financial condition

<<<

 of the Borrower. In the opinion of the Borrower, avoiding these unintended consequences will benefit the Borrower and therefore ultimately benefit the Bondholders.
According to the Loan Agreements, the proposed consent requires approval from

<<<

 the Bondholders. Such approval ought to be given if the Bondholders find the overall risk assessment and risk compensation (if any) to be fair.

The Loan Trustee notes that the Borrower requests a consent

<<<

 from the Bondholders which temporarily relaxes the requirements to the financial position of the Borrower without offering any compensation to the Bondholders for the proposed changes. The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further

 evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
