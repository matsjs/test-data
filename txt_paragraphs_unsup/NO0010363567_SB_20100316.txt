1.1 Enforcement of the Loan Security
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"/"Norsk Tillitsmann") is appointed loan trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned loan with

<<<

 ISIN NO 001 036356.7 (the "Loan"), established under the loan agreement dated 27 April 2007 (the "Loan Agreement") with Interoil Exploration and Production ASA as borrower (the "Borrower").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning

<<<

 assigned to them in the Loan Agreement unless otherwise stated in this summons.
The Borrower failed to make repayment of the instalment of the Loan on the Payment Date falling on 5 May 2009, as required by Clause 10.1 of the Loan Agreement

<<<

.

Exploration and Production Latin AméfrlchAS, Interoil Exploration and Production Africa AS, and Interoil Exploration and Production Ghana AS (together the "Shares"), was denied

<<<

.
The Enforcement Officer found that Norsk Tillitsmann is not "entitled'pursuant to Section 46, Subsection lo f the Enforcement Act.
According to the Enforcement Officer's reasoning, Norsk Tillitsmann is granted power by the share pledge agreement

<<<

 to request enforcement of the Shares, but this must be interpreted as "on behalf o f the bondholders" and does not award Norsk Tillitsmann the position of "entitled" in the sense of the Enforcement Act.
The Enforcement Officer's decision is

<<<

 based on the enforceable claim and the security interest in the Shares both being vested with the Bondholders.
From the Enforcement Officer's reasoning we quote: "The owners o f the bonds become bound by the loan agreement and grant an authority

<<<

 to Norsk Tillitsmann on subscription to the bonds. In the agreement, Norsk Tillitsmann is referred to as"the Loan Trustee".
[ ]
This means that, on disbursement o f the loan to the borrower, the bondholders become the owners o f both the secured

<<<

 claim and the security interest itself'.
As a consequence the Enforcement Officer finds that only the Bondholders are "entitled" pursuant to the Enforcement Act to request the forced sale of the Shares.
The decision of the Enforcement Officer

<<<

 has been appealed to the courts of first instance by a complaint from Norsk Tillitsmann dated 9 March 2010 (the "Complaint").
In order to avoid further delay in the enforcement proceedings, GLG Pendragon Event Driven Fund, GLG Atlas Macro Fund

<<<

, GLG Atlas Value & Recovery Fund, QVT Fund LP and Quintessence Fund L.P and any of their successors as the case may be (together the "GLG/QVT Funds") are prepared to file a petition for the forced sale of the Shares in their own names, in parallel

<<<

 to the Complaint.
1.3 Separate filing for enforcement proceedings by the Bondholders
It is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting authorises the filing of a separate petition for a forced sale of the Shares from one/ more of the Bondholders

<<<

 directly, provided that the principle of equality among the Bondholders is maintained and the enforcement proceedings are for the benefit of all the Bondholders.
In order to ensure that the enforcement proceedings are opened by the Enforcement

<<<

 Officer of Asker and Bserum, the GLG/QVT Funds are prepared to file a petition for the forced sale of the Shares from the GLG/QVT Funds directly, as creditors under the Loan Agreement and "entitled" pursuant to the share pledge agreement (the

<<<

 "Separate Enforcement").
It is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting consents to the separate petition for the enforcement of the Loan Security against the Borrower, filed by the GLG/QVT Funds and any of the other Bondholders jointly.

<<<

 any of the Bondholders (other than the GLG/QVT Funds), in their own discretion, against the Borrower.

<<<

 enforcement petitions, such costs and expenses are to be recovered and reimbursed as, and to the extent, provided for by the Loan Agreement, the share pledge agreement of 2 May 2007 and applicable law.
In order to ensure that the distribution

<<<

 of the sales proceeds from the forced sale of the Shares is for the benefit of all the Bondholders in the Loan, it is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting authorises Norsk Tillitsmann to, on behalf of the Bondholders, (i) file with the Enforcement

<<<

 Officer the total outstanding claim under the Loan Agreement, including accrued interest, default interest, costs and expenses to the enforcement authorities, and (ii) accept and receive payment from the forced sale of the Shares.
