Over the last weeks there have been constructive

<<<

 discussions and meetings between the Company, the Bondholders in the Bonds (including their legal and financial advisers Bingham and AMA, respectively) and the lenders under the bank facility (the "Banks") in order to seek an acceptable solution

<<<

 to the challenges that Nexus and its stakeholders are facing. Despite this, additional time is needed as no solution has yet been agreed.
Accordingly, the Banks have agreed with the Loan Trustee and the Company to further extend its stand-still

<<<

 agreement and thereby not treating Nexus as being in default until 7 August 2009 at 5:00 pm Singapore time, the Banks are releasing the required funds to finance the operational expense for the Company until 7 August 2009, and that the Banks

<<<

 are agreeing to continue its discussions with the Bondholders Committee. Based on this, the Company summons a Bondholders' meeting asking the Bondholders in the Bonds to further defer the interest payments, for the USD 175 million Bond (originally

<<<

 due 7 June 2009, and currently deferred to 17 July 2009), until 7 August 2009, and for the USD 75 million convertible Bond (originally due 25 June 2009, and currently deferred to 21 July 2009) until 11 August 2009. In each case the deferrals

<<<

 are subject to (a) the Banks not treating Nexus as being in default until the earlier of 7 August 2009 and 7 days prior to the proposed actual date of delivery of the Vessel from the shipyard, (b) the Banks releasing the required funds to finance

<<<

 the operational expense for the Company until the earlier of 7 August 2009 and 7 days prior to the proposed actual date of delivery o f the Vessel from the shipyard, and (c) the Banks agreeing to continue discussions with the Bondholders Committee

<<<

.
At the same time, the Company is conscious that the current situation is challenging and involves discussions with the different stakeholders, as well as evaluating and discussing various strategic alternatives, and accordingly it is quite

<<<

 possible that further extensions of interest payments and consents from the Banks may be required after 7 August and 11 August 2009. In particular, this consumes time for the management of Nexus in preparing for and implementing summons to

<<<

 Bondholders' meetings.
To facilitate a more flexible handling of the Company's requests related to any further deferral of interest payments related to the Bonds, Nexus is asking the Bondholders to give the Trustee the power o f attorney to

<<<

 agree to further deferrals of the interest payments for the Bonds for a period of maximum o f 10 Banking Days each time such deferral is given, subject to a long-stop date of 18 September 2009. Such decision for further interest payment deferrals

<<<

 by the Trustee shall be in agreement with a majority of the Bondholders in each of the USD 175 million Bond and the USD 75 million Convertible Bond, subject to there being a contemporaneous acceptable stand-still agreement with the Banks similar

<<<

 to the stand-still agreements that have been given up until now.
Proposal
The Company therefore also proposes the following (the "Proposal"):
For the USD 175 million Bond:
