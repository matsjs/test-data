 Bond Issue 2013/2018
Oslo, 4 May 2016
NOTICE OF A WRITTEN BONDHOLDERS' RESOLUTION: PROPOSAL TO GRANT ISSUER ACCESS TO RESTRICTED CASH IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bondholders (the

<<<

 "Bondholders") in the "7.5 per cent BassDrill Alpha Ltd. Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2018" - ISIN: NO 001068432.7 (the "Bond Issue"), issued by BassDrill Alpha Ltd, Bermuda (the "Issuer").
All capitalised terms used herein and not

<<<

 otherwise defined in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the bond loan agreement for the Bond Issue dated 3 July 2013 (the "Bond Agreement").
The Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to issue this request

<<<

 for a written Bondholders' resolution pursuant to clause 16.5 (Written Resolution) of the Bond Agreement to consider the approval of the Proposed Resolution, as further set out below.
The information in this Summons regarding the Issuer and

<<<

 market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. THE PROPOSAL
1.1 Access to Restricted Cash We refer to the summons to the Bondholders' Meeting dated

<<<

 29 March 2016 and the Bondholders' Meeting held on 12 April 2016, in which, inter alia, payment of the interest and principal instalment payments due on the Interest Payment Date of 5 April 2016 were temporarily waived until 20 May 2016 and

<<<

 certain other waivers of the Issuer's obligations under the Bond Agreement were granted.
Over the past few weeks, the Issuer's holdings of free cash have been severely depleted and the Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that it now has an

requirement. The Issuer's current unrestricted cash reserves amount to only USD 19,000, although the Issuer currently has restricted cash reserves of approximately USD 7,800,000.
In particular

<<<

, the Issuer has provided to the Bond Trustee and an ad hoc committee of Bondholders holding more than 58% of the outstanding Bonds (the "Committee") a six week cash-flow indicating aggregate payments of up to USD 1,480,787 that are required

<<<

 to be made up to and including 12 June 2016 to meet certain upcoming operational expenses of the Company (the "Cash Flow Forecast", and the payments contemplated therein being the "Permitted Payments"). Payment of the Permitted Payments will

<<<

 secure the ongoing warm stacking of the BassDrill Alpha tender drilling barge while the Issuer and the Bondholders seek to agree on a longer term financial restructuring proposal. Subject to Bondholders providing the Trustee with satisfactory

<<<

 proof of their holdings of Bonds, the Cash Flow Forecast will be made available for inspection by any Bondholder upon request to the Bond Trustee.
The Issuer is requesting that the Bondholders therefore grant the Issuer authority to withdraw

<<<

 up to USD 1,480,787 of restricted cash from the Reserve Account, for the sole puipose of funding the Permitted Payments as further detailed in the Cash Flow Forecast.
The Committee have already indicated their support for the proposal as outlined

<<<

 below (the "Proposal").
1.2 The Proposed Resolution The Issuer requests that the Bondholders adopt the following resolution (the "Proposed Resolution"):
(a) Bondholders agree to waive on the terms set out below, the requirements set forth in

<<<

 clauses 13.4(e) (Reserve Account) and 13.6(b) (Liquidity) of the Bond Agreement, which require the Issuer to ensure that the amount standing on the Reserve Account less any Initial Dividend still standing on the Reserve Account at all times

<<<

 equals a minimum of USD 5 million, such that this amount may be reduced to USD 3,519,213 for the purpose of making the Permitted Payments (the "Reserve Account Waiver").
(b) After giving effect to the Reserve Account Waiver, Bondholders agree

<<<

 to permit the Issuer access to funds in the Reserve Account in an aggregate amount of up to USD 1,480,787 for the sole purpose of funding the Permitted Payments as further detailed in the Issuer's Cash Flow Forecast (the "Waiver Condition"

<<<

).
(c) The Reserve Account Waiver shall (if applicable) be terminated on the date that is the earlier of the date on which (i) the Bond Trustee gives written notice of the same to the Issuer with the approval of Bondholders holding a simple

<<<

Bonds (whether through written instructions or at a Bondholders' Meeting); or (ii) the Waiver Condition is breached. In either such event, the Reserve Account Waiver shall immediately cease to be effective

<<<

 with respect to any further payments from the Reserve Account.
The Bond Trustee shall be instructed to do all things and take such steps on behalf of the Bondholders as may be necessary or desirable in connection with the Proposal, including

<<<

, without limitation, negotiating and approving the final terms of, and entering into, any and all documentation and agreements deemed necessary or desirable by the Bond Trustee.
Other than any waivers and amendments prompted by the Proposal
