<<<

4.1.2.

The right to payment in respect of the Bonds is subordinated in the event of the liquidation, dissolution, administration or other winding-up of the Issuer by way of public administration to the claims of Senior Creditors

<<<

 and (except in the event of the liquidation, dissolution, administration or other winding-up of the Issuer by way of public administration) all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Bonds are conditional upon the Issuer being

<<<

<<<

 in respect of Other Pari Passu Claims, and still be Solvent immediately thereafter. The payment of interest on the Bonds is also subject to the provisions of Clause 5.1 (Deferral o f Payments).

4.1.3.

The provisions o f this Clause 4.1 apply

<<<

 only to the principal and interest in respect o f the Bonds and nothing in this Clause 4.1 shall affect or prejudice the payment of the costs, charges, expenses, liabilities or remuneration of the Bond Trustee or the rights and remedies of

<<<

4.2.1. The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Bonds will be performed in

<<<

4.2.2.

Pursuant to the Norwegian Act on Guarantee Schemes fo r Banks and Public Administration o f 6 December 1996 (the

<<<

 Act), Section 3-1(1), the Board o fDirectors and the Managing Director o f afinancial institution (such as the Issuer) are separately obliged to notify Kredittilsynet i f there is reason to think that:

6

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
1. there may

<<<

 he afailure in the ability o f the institution to meet its liabilities as they fa ll due; or 2. the institution will not be able to meet the minimum requirements on capital adequacy or other statutory requirements on solidity or security; or

<<<

 3. events have occurred that may lead to a serious depletion o f confidence or losses that will significantly reduce or threaten solidity.
Pursuant to Section 3-1 (2) o f the Act, i f the external auditor o f the institution becomes aware o

<<<

 f any such conditions, he shall notify Kredittilsynet unless he has already been informed by Kredittilsynet that such notice has been receivedfrom the Board o fDirectors and the Managing Director o f the institution.
Section 3-2 o f the Act

<<<

 provides that Kredittilsynet, upon receipt o f the notice referred to in Section 3-1 or Kredittilsynet itselfhaving reason to believe that the conditions stipulated under Section 3-1 have occurred, shall, in consultation with the institution

<<<

, consider what measures are necessary. I f no required measures are implemented by the institution itself, Kredittilsynet may summon a shareholders' meeting without observing set notice periods to require a change in the composition o f the

<<<

 corporate bodies o f the institution as well as stipulate such conditions and guidelines that it deems necessaryfor the continued operation o f the institution on a sound economic basis and in an otherwise proper way.
Section 3-4 o f the Act

<<<

 states that a shareholders' meeting shall be called i f a significant part o f the institution`s equity has been lost or i f the audited statement offinancial position shows that more than 25 per cent, o f the share capital o f the institution

<<<

 has been lost. The shareholders 'meeting shall decide whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue its operations in a proper way. A decision to such effect requires a qualified majority and approval by Kredittilsynet. I f such

<<<

 decision is not reached, the shareholders 'meeting may by a simple majority resolve that the total business o f the institution shall be taken over by another institution. In the absence o f any such decision, the institution shall be liquidated

<<<

 by a board appointed by Kredittilsynet.
Section 3-5 o f the Act provides that i f the audited statement o ffinancial position shows that only 25 per cent, or less o f the share capital o f afinancial institution is intact, the board shall present

<<<

 to the general meeting a description o f the institution'sfinancial position, accompanied by a proposal to write down the share capital against losses shown in the audited statement offinancial position. I f the general meeting does not pass

<<<

 a resolution pursuant to the write-down proposal within the period stipulated by Kredittilsynet, the Ministry o f Finance may decide that the share capital shall be written down by the amount o f capital shown to have been lost by the audited

<<<

 statement o ffinancial position.
Pursuant to Section 3-6 o f the Act, subordinated capital (which term under the Act includes, but does not distinguish between, dated and undated subordinated indebtedness) may be written down i f the audited

<<<

 accounts o f afinancial institution show that a substantial part o f the institution's subordinated capital has been lost. Such a write-down may be resolved by a shareholders 'meeting acting upon a proposal which the Board o f Directors is

<<<

 obliged to submit under such circumstances. I f the shareholders 'meeting does not resolve on a write down, the Ministry o fFinance may decide that the subordinated capital shall be written down to the extent required to cover the loss o fsuch

<<<

 capital.
I f the Board o fDirectors were required to submit such a proposal, the Issuer has undertaken that such a proposal would include a recommendationfrom the Board o f Directors that principal in respect o f tier one indebtedness should

<<<

 be written down prior to
7

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
any principal in respect o f undated tier 2 subordinated indebtedness (including the Bonds). It should be noted that such a recommendation would not bind the decision to be taken at such a

<<<

 shareholders 'meeting which could resolve to write-down principal in respect o f subordinated indebtedness (whether dated or undated and whether tier one or tier two) in such order as the shareholders determine. I f the shareholders 'meeting

<<<

 does not resolve on a write-down, the Ministry o fFinance may decide that the subordinated capital shall be written down to the extent required to cover the loss o fsuch capital. Section 3-6 will apply irrespective o f whether an institution

<<<

 is under public administration or not. However, in view o f the circumstances under which the board o f an institution mustpropose a write down to the shareholders 'meeting, it seems reasonable to assume thatpublic administration o f the relevantfinancial

<<<

 institution will be one o f the alternatives that will be considered by the regulaloty authorities at such time.
Pursuant to Section 4-5 o f the Act, the Ministry o fFinance may place afinancial institution such as the Issuer under public administration

<<<

 i f the Issuer cannot meet its liabilities as theyfall due and the economic conditionsfor future activity are not present. The same applies i f the Issuer will not be able to satisfy capital adequacy or solvency (if applicable) requirements

<<<

, unless a temporary dispensation is given. I f the Issuer is placed under public administration Kredittilsynet shall appoint an administration board, which replaces all the corporate bodies o f the institution. Pursuant to Section 4-6 o f the

<<<

 Act, while under public administration, no payment may be made to creditors without the consent o fKredittilsynet. A public administration proceeding may result in one o f the following three outcomes (i) the institution is allowed to resume

<<<

 operation (Section 4-9) after, i f necessary, afinancial restructuring, (ii) the institution may be merged with or taken over by another institution, or (in) i f (i) or (ii) has not materialised or does not seem imminent within one year o f

<<<

 being placed under public administration, the institution shall be dissolved.
Note: The above is a summary o f the provisions o f the Act as such provisions apply to a Norwegian insurance companyfacing equity/liquidity problems as described

<<<

. The summary does notpurport to reflect all relevant and detailed rules o fsuch Act.
Pursuant to the above, and subject to applicable provisions of Norwegian law, the Issuer undertakes that it will recommend that its shareholders cancel all

<<<

 principal in respect of all Tier 1 Capital and all paid up equity and equity fund/retained earnings of the Issuer before cancelling any principal in respect of the Bonds. Cancellations of principal in respect of the Bonds shall occur pari passu

<<<

 amongst the Bonds and on a pro rata basis with all other pari passu claims.
The Issuer shall give not more than 30 nor less than 5 Business Days' prior notice to the Bond Trustee, the Paying Agent, to the Bondholders and to the Exchange in

<<<

 accordance with Clause 8.7 (Notices) of any cancellation o f principal in respect of the Bonds pursuant to this Clause 4.2. To the extent that only part o f the principal amount of the Bonds has been cancelled as provided above, interest will

<<<

 continue to accrue in accordance with these Conditions on the remaining outstanding principal amount of the Bonds.

4.3. Limitation on other undated subordinated indebtedness

4.3.1.

The Issuer shall not, without the prior approval of a resolution

<<<

 of a simple majority o f the Bondholders create, assume, grant or permit to be outstanding any further Undated Subordinated Indebtedness (whether actual or contingent) unless such Undated Subordinated Indebtedness is subordinated in right of

<<<

 payment, subject to applicable law,
