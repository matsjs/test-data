USD 450,000 in respect of the Standstill Fee for September;

·

pursuant to Additional Clause 27 of the MoA, the Additional Deposit shall be released to the

Issuer on completion of the Sale, unless the Vessel

released back to Ocean following receipt of evidence to the Issuer's reasonable satisfaction

that (i) hull &

<<<

 machinery cover for the Vessel is in place and all premiums paid in an amount

at least equal to the insured value of the Vessel and (ii) that a bona fide claim in respect of the

total loss has been made by the Charterer to the Vessel's hull

 & machinery insurers in an

amount at least equal to the insured value of the Vessel. The Initial Deposit shall, in any

event, be retained by the Issuer;

amount of USD 56 million (the "Purchase Price Balance") for the Vessel and the BOP. The

Purchase Price Balance will be paid in addition

<<<

 to the Additional Deposit;

·

the Issuer shall release Ocean and the Charterer from any liability they may have in respect of

the Charterparty, the BOP and the Standstill Letter (including the unpaid Standstill Fee for

October);

·

<<<

 other terms and conditions of the MoA to remain unamended.

The Issuer does not intend to seek consent from Bondholders to the Revised Conditions until such time as Ocean has formally confirmed in writing in such terms as are acceptable to

<<<

 the Issuer. Thus far, it has not. The Issuer will advise Bondholders should circumstances change.

All rights of the Issuer under the Charterparty have been reserved.
