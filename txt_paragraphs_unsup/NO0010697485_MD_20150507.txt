Results and main developments for the three months ended M arch 31, 2015
First quarter results The net result after tax for the first quarter of 2015 amounted

<<<

 to U.S.$(15.0) million loss compared to a loss of U.S.$(3.3) million for the first quarter of 2014. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2015 w as U.S.$56.1 million compared to U.S.$40.0 million for the first quarter of 2014. The financial results

<<<

 for the first quarter of 2015 w ere mainly impacted by the follow ing:
The SPM division generated U.S.$10.3 million EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 compared to U.S.$1.4 million EBITDA in the first quarter of 2014. SPM results for the first

<<<

 quarter of 2015 w ere driven by tw o large projects that started during 2014 and have achieved significant progress. These projects are expected to continue to contribute to EBITDA during the remainder of this year. In the first quarter of

<<<

 2014, progress on SPM projects w as in early stages, resulting in less significant recording of EBITDA. Additionally, the SPM result for the first quarter of 2015 w as impacted positively due to the final close-out of earlier delivered projects

<<<

.
EBITDA for the FPSO division for the first quarter of 2015 amounted to U.S.$45.9 million compared to U.S.$40.3 million for the first quarter of 2014. The U.S.$5.6 million increase in EBITDA compared to the first quarter of 2014 w as mainly

<<<

 driven by a U.S.$13.9 million increase in EBITDA for the FPSO Haew ene Brim. This increase in EBITDA w as due to U.S.$18.3 million amortization of deferred income in relation to the capitalized Brynhild project costs, partly offset by increased

<<<

 maintenance costs and reduced income due to constraints in production levels during the first quarter of 2015. EBITDA for the FPSO Glas Dow r reduced by U.S.$4.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2014, due to increased operational expenditures

<<<

 and accrued credits on the daily hire rate. These foreseen discounts to the hire rate w ill, once commercial agreement including terms for a contract extension is reached w ith the operator, become effective from January 1, 2015. Additionally

<<<

, EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm decreased by U.S.$2.3 million due to the decreased day rate follow ing the contract amendment that became effective August 1, 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, the low er day rate w as not fully offset by the

<<<

 higher tariff income. EBITDA of the FPSO Aoka M izu remained at the same level compared to the first quarter of the previous year. Finally the FPSO tender costs in 2015 increased by U.S.$1.6 million, mainly due to the tender activities in relation

<<<

 to redeployment the FPSO M unin and of the FPSO Aoka M izu.
During the first quarter of 2015, overhead costs w ere fully recovered, compared to U.S.$1.6 million unallocated expenses for the first quarter of 2014. The higher overhead recovery

<<<

 w as driven by a increased project activity and utilization of the engineering staff compared to the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, Euro denominated costs decreased as a result of the decreasing Euro --- Dollar exchange rate during the

<<<

 first quarter of 2015.
Depreciation expenditure for the first quarter of 2015 amounted to U.S.$36.7 million compared to U.S.$22.9 million for the first quarter of 2014. The increase w as driven by the additional U.S.$18.3 million depreciation

<<<

 for the FPSO Haew ene Brim follow ing completion of the Brynhild project, partly offset by one of the assets being fully depreciated since April 2014.
Finance expenses for the first quarter of 2015 w ere U.S.$3.1 million low er compared to

<<<

 the previous year, at U.S.$15.3 million versus U.S.$18.4 million in the first quarter of 2014. Finance expense for the bond loan decreased by U.S.$1.4 million, from U.S.$11.4 million for the first quarter of 2014 to U.S.$10.0 million for the

<<<

 first quarter of 2015. The bond loan interest in the first quarter of 2014 included U.S.$1.4 million interest in relation to the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond loan that w as repaid on January 27, 2014 and U.S.$10.0 million interest on the

<<<

 new U.S.$400 million bond loan. Additionally, finance expense for the first quarter of 2014 included U.S.$0.4 million of non-recurring costs in relation to the cancellation of the interest rate sw ap on the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond loan

<<<

. Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$1.3 million compared to the previous year, due to further reduction of net debt, resulting from steady operating cash flow .
2

Currency exchange results w ere U.S.$16.3 million negative in the first

<<<

 quarter of 2015 compared to U.S.$0.2 million positive in the first quarter of 2014. The currency exchange results relate mainly to the negative fair value of Euro denominated forw ard exchange contracts that w ere entered into to hedge the

<<<

 currency exposure on SPM projects. Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2015 amounted U.S.$2.8 million versus U.S.$2.2 million for the first quarter of 2014. The income tax expense in the first quarter of 2015 relates to U.S.$1.5 million

<<<

 w ithholding tax in relation to the Glas Dow r revenues, U.S.$0.6 million w ithholding tax incurred in relation to SPM revenues and U.S.$0.7 million corporate taxes in other jurisdictions. The U.S.$2.2 million income tax expense in the first

<<<

 quarter of 2014 included U.S.$1.6 million w ithholding tax in relation to the Glas Dow r revenues and a U.S.$0.6 million Dutch corporate tax payment. Other developments On April 15, 2015, an insurance claim amounting to U.S.$2.3 million (EUR

<<<

 2.1 million) w as aw arded to the Company by its insurers, in relation to the fire in Bluew ater's test facility in 2014. As most costs incurred due to this incident have already been recognized during 2014, in accordance w ith the Company

<<<

's accounting policy, these insurance proceeds w ill contribute to the 2015 SPM result.

General information Aurelia Energy N.V. (``the Company'') is the holding company of the Bluew ater group (Bluew ater), a specialized service provider

<<<

 to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluew ater designs, develops, ow ns and operates floating production storage and offloading units (``FPSOs''), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops, performs

<<<

 project management and constructs single point mooring systems (``SPM s''). An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either new ly

<<<

 built or converted tankers upon w hich production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and w ater) are processed onboard the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported to an off take system utilizing shuttle

<<<

 tankers. Bluew ater's fleet of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- and long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts

<<<

. SPM s are used to transfer fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker w hile securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. M ost SPM s consist of an anchoring system that is connected

<<<

 to the ocean floor and a fluid transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids betw een fixed and rotating parts of the mooring system. SPM s are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors. Revenues are earned

<<<

 from day rates consisting of a fixed facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases w ith oil companies, supplemented from time to time w ith fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues

<<<

 are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed. FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial

<<<

 design and engineering phase to final installation. Further, Bluew ater engages subcontractors in the fabrication of FPSOs, SPM s and auxiliary equipment.

Statement of compliance The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent w ith International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual

<<<

 financial statements.
Basis of preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, w hich is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented has been

<<<

 rounded to the nearest thousand. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent w ith the recognition and measurement criteria of the International Financial Reporting

<<<

 Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements. The information furnished in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments w

<<<

 and underlying assumptions are review ed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in w hich the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, significant areas of estimation

<<<

 uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the unaudited interim financial statements are:
 Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on the

<<<

 percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned w ith the leased facilities;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forw ard;  Potential impact of claims and litigation
