 the previously announced sale of the entire issued share capital of Sterling Resources (UK) Ltd. ("SRUK") pursuant to the share purchase agreement dated March 3, 2017 between the Company, SRUK Holdings Ltd. and Oranje-Nassau Energie B.V. (the

<<<

 "Transaction"). The purchase price paid to SRUK Holdings Ltd. at closing of the Transaction was US$97.0 million. In addition, intercompany debt was settled between SRUK and the Company of US$16.8 million bringing the total cash proceeds at

<<<

 of the net proceeds from the Transaction to the Sterling shareholders (the "Shareholders"), after payment of all Transaction costs and satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Company. The Company does not intend to apply for delisting

 of the Common Shares from the TSX Venture Exchange (the "TSXV"), but the TSXV may on its own initiative delist the Common Shares or transfer the listing to the NEX Board prior to the completion of the distributions of the Company's assets 

<<<

(including the net proceeds of the Transaction) and the subsequent winding-up.

 by SRUK with Nordic Trustee ASA as bond trustee, with ISIN NO 001 0675671 and ticker STRE01 PRO on Nordic ABM. The settlement date for the bond redemption is expected to be May 19, 2017, after which all bonds will be cancelled and cease to
