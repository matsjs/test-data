 Ltd FRN Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012

Oslo, 16 March 2009

Proposal to Approve Sale of FPSO - Summons to Bondholders Meeting

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" or the "Loan Trustee") acts as Loan Trustee for the US$ 150,000,000 bond loan (the 

<<<

"Loan" and the "Bonds") mentioned above issued by PetroProd Ltd as borrower (the "Borrower").

All capitalized terms used herein, and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement dated January

<<<

 5, 2007 in respect of the Loan (the "Loan Agreement").

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information

<<<

.

The Borrower is calling for the Bondholders' meeting in the Bond Loan.

1. Introduction and background

Reference is made to a previous stock exchange announcement to the market by the Borrower dated 14 January 2009, pursuant to which it

<<<

 was made known that the Borrower has entered into an agreement (the "FPSO Sale Agreement") with an undisclosed operator (the "Buyer") to sell the FPSO (the MT "Arc II") which is currently under conversion from an Aframax tanker to a floating

<<<

 production storage and off-loading unit (the "FPSO") at the Jurong Shipyard (the "Shipyard") in Singapore (the sale transaction concerning the FPSO hereinafter referred to as the "FPSO Sale").

The purpose of the Meeting is to seek the approval

<<<

 of the holders of the Bonds (the "Bondholders") to the FPSO Sale and certain matters relating thereto which will affect the Bondholders.

In recognition of the complexity of the proposal and the FPSO Sale, NTM has (on behalf of the Bondholders

<<<

) engaged AMA Capital Partners ("AMA") as financial adviser and Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham") as legal adviser, to review the Proposal, and to provide their assessment of the Proposal prior to the Meeting. The Borrower has agreed

<<<

 to co-operate with and meet the fees of AMA and Bingham, and to provide them with the information required to enable them to make such assessment. Indeed, the Borrower and its advisers have held an initial meeting with AMA and Bingham regarding

<<<

 the terms of the Proposal, and following that meeting are continuing to discuss how the Proposal might be further developed in a manner which is beneficial to Bondholders and mutually satisfactory

to the Borrower. In connection herewith, it may

<<<

 also be explored whether a one time cash settlement by way of a redemption and write off of the Loan is a viable solution.
Accordingly, it is anticipated that, prior to the Meeting, further terms, conditions and clarifications, which are in

<<<

 the interests of and to the benefit of Bondholders may be added to the Proposal and circulated to Bondholders, and that further information regarding the Proposal and AMA and Bingham's assessment of the Proposal will be made available to Bondholders

<<<

 (access to certain information may be subject to Bondholders signing appropriate confidentiality documentation).
However, as can be seen from the description below, the Company is very short of time, and this Proposal is therefore being distributed

<<<

 now to ensure that the Meeting can take place when required in accordance with the notice provisions under the Bonds.
2. The FPSO Sale
The FPSO is currently owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Borrower, Larog (Cyprus) Ltd ("Larog"), and

<<<

 the FPSO Sale shall according to the FPSO Sale Agreement be structured by way of a sale, and/or issuance, of shares in Larog (the "Larog Shares") to the Buyer.
The purchase price for the Larog Shares under the FPSO Sale Agreement is US$ 21

<<<

6,000,000, less commission and sales expenses (the "Purchase Price"), to be paid by the Buyer in installments as follows: (i) 20 per cent of the Purchase Price within 30 days after the effective date of the FPSO Sale Agreement which was March

<<<

 3, 2009 (the "Effective Date") and issuance of invoice, (ii) 20 per cent of the Purchase Price within 60 days after payment of the first installment; (iii) 15 per cent of the Purchase Price after delivery of project topsides modules to the

<<<

 shipyard, within 30 days after invoice, (iv) 15 per cent of the Purchase Price after commencement of FPSO pre-commissioning, within 30 days after invoice (v) 10 per cent of the Purchase Price after delivery of anchors and chains for mooring

<<<

 system, (vi) 10 per cent of the Purchase Price after FPSO sail away from shipyard, (vii) 5 per cent of the Purchase Price upon FPSO arrival to delivery destination and (ix) 5 per cent 30 days after commencement of successful operation. However

<<<

, from each invoice an amount of 5 per cent of the invoiced amount shall be deducted and kept by Buyer as good performance guarantee, until the end of the guarantee period being 12 after issuance of completion certificate.
Upon payment of each

<<<

 installment of the Purchase Price by the Buyer, an equal percentage of the shares in Larog shall be transferred and/or issued to the Buyer.
The Buyer has expressed to the Borrower that it intends to pay the first installment of US$41,040,0

<<<

00 of the Purchase Price (the "First Installment'') to an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") on March 25, 2009 in anticipation of settlement.
A total amount of approximately US$181,000,000 out of the Purchase Price shall be sourced to Larog

<<<

 to cover estimated costs for completion of the conversion process for the FPSO, leaving approximately an estimated total of US$35,000,000 out of the Purchase Price retained by the Borrower. Certain equipment purchased by the Borrower for use

<<<

 in the FPSO (the main parts of which is delivered from the suppliers but not incorporated into the FPSO), is not included in the specifications for the FPSO subject to the FPSO Sale. This relates to the turret, swivel and certain process equipment

<<<

 acquired by the Borrower for a total cost of
2

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
approximately US$ 50,900,000. No assurance can be given as to the amount for which such equipment may be sold for, but any revenues from a potential sale of such

<<<

 equipment will add to the above mentioned US$ 35,000,000 to be retained by the Borrower.
From the time of payment by the Buyer of the First Installment and up until the completion date for the FPSO on or around the first quarter of 2010 (the

<<<

 "Completion Date"), the Buyer may not dispose of any of its Larog Shares to a third party and may not change the board of directors of Larog.
Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower (or the FPSO owning subsidiary) may not dispose of the FPSO

<<<

 or the shares in the vessel owning subsidiary without prior consent from the Bondholders.
The Loan is secured by, inter alia, (i) the Aframax Vessel # 1 Mortgage, (ii) the Assignment of Contracts, (iii) a Guarantee from Larog for the Borrower

<<<

's obligations under the Loan Agreement (the "Larog Guarantee"), and (iv) a pledge of all outstanding shares in Petroprod 1 Ltd ("PetroProd 1") and Larog (the "Larog Share Pledge").
The FPSO was transferred from PetroProd 1 to Larog (the "Intra

<<<

 Group FPSO Sale") during the first quarter of 2009 in order to facilitate the FPSO Sale, for a purchase price of US$50,500,000 subject to deferred settlement by a seller's credit (the "Seller's Credit"). The Seller's Credit is also pledged

<<<

 in the favor of the Bondholders (the "Seller's Credit Pledge"). The Seller's Credit is expected to be converted into shares in Larog if the Proposal is approved. The Bondholders are kindly asked to consent to such conversion and discharge of

<<<

 the Seller's Credit Pledge. It is not expected that this will have any negative tax implications for Larog or the Borrower.
The payment of the First Installment of the Purchase Price by the Buyer will require a corresponding transfer, and/or

<<<

 issuance, of an amount of shares in Larog equaling 19 per cent of the outstanding shares in Larog to the Buyer. Further installments will require transfer and/or issuance of further shares in Larog as described above.
On this basis, the Bondholders

<<<

 are kindly asked to consent to the transfer and/or issuance of shares in Larog to the Buyer upon the Buyers payment of installments as described above, and the proportional discharge the Larog Share Pledge, and issuance of new shares in Larog

<<<

 to the Buyer not comprised by the Larog Share Pledge (as applicable), as part of settlement procedure under the FPSO Sale Agreement as described above. If the approvals from the Bondholders, as discussed under the heading "Proposal" below are

<<<

 not obtained, the Borrower will not be able to deliver 19 per cent of the Larog Shares to the Buyer within April 3, 2009, and the First Installment will not be released from the Escrow Account. In such case, the FPSO Sale Agreement will terminate

<<<

 and the FPSO Sale will not be completed.
Finalization of the FPSO Sales Agreement will also require the (i) discharge the Aframax Vessel # 1 Mortgage, (ii) discharge the Assignment of Contracts, and (iii) release of Larog of its obligations

<<<

 under the Larog Guarantee. The Borrower is of the opinion that, in light of the present financial situation of the Borrower, no payment should take place under the FPSO Sales Agreement prior to the Bondholders having pre-consented to such discharges

<<<

/releases of security interests related to the FPSO upon the payment by the Buyer of the second installment of US$ 41,040,000 of the Purchase Price on or about May 25, 2009 (the "Second Installment").

3. Proposal

<<<


The Borrower acknowledges that the Bondholders have limited time available to consider and vote on the Proposal, and regrets that it has taken time to issue the Proposal. The Borrower's preference was to achieve a global solution (see "Global

<<<

 solution sought by the Borrower" below) for all bondholders in the bond loans issued by the Borrower at an earlier stage, however this process has taken more time than initially anticipated.
The Borrower will humbly respect any decision made

<<<

 by the Bondholders with respect to the Proposal, and if not agreed by the Bondholders, will use its best endeavors to find an alternative solution to its debt situation and the FPSO project. However, the Borrower is of the opinion that the

<<<

 FPSO Sale as proposed is the best achievable solution for the FPSO project, the Borrower and the Bondholders.
The Borrower has requested NTM to summon the Meeting for the purpose of considering and approving (i) the FPSO Sale, (ii) the discharge

<<<

 of the Aframax Vessel # 1 Mortgage with effective date no later than the date for payment of the Second Installment for the purposes of completing the FPSO Sale, (iii) the discharge of the Assignment of Contracts with effective date no later

<<<

 than the date for payment of the Second Installment for the purposes of completing the FPSO Sale, (iv) the release of Larog's obligations under the Larog Guarantee with effective date no later than the date for payment of the Second Installment

<<<

 (v) the conversion of the debt of US$ 50,500,000 plus accrued interest (at a rate of 5 per cent per annum) owed by Tarog pursuant to the Intra Group FPSO Sale to new shares in Larog and discharge of the Seller's Credit Pledge and (vi) the 

<<<

(partial, as applicable) discharge of the Larog Share Pledge, and issuance of new shares in Larog not to be comprised by the Larog Share Pledge to the Buyer, to the extent required for delivery of the Larog Shares to the Buyer in accordance

<<<

 with the settlement procedure under the FPSO Sale Agreement.
The Borrower acknowledges that the approvals above most likely will require a more complete restructuring solution. The Borrower suggest that the approvals are conditioned thereupon

<<<

 and that the Meeting mandates NTM to negotiate and enter into an amendment agreement to the Loan Agreement for such purpose and any other matter reasonably required for implementing the above facilitating the FPSO Sale.
4. Rationale for the

<<<

 FPSO Sale
The FPSO sale will result in the exit by the Borrower from the FPSO market for the time being. This is due, in part, to (i) recent market developments within that segment, (ii) the magnitude of the investments required in order to

<<<

 complete the conversion works, (iii) the current turmoil in the financial markets, as well as (iv) the desire on part of the Borrower to seek the best possible, firm solution for its stakeholders in a period with continuing and fundamental

<<<

 uncertainty for the period going forward.
Acknowledging that the Borrower has embarked upon capital-intensive projects with an exposed risk profile both in terms of availability of financing, market opportunities within the FPSO segment, and

<<<

 conversion completion risk, the Borrower has come to believe that it would be a better solution for bondholders and shareholders alike to abandon the FPSO strategy, cut the losses, and exit on terms which in the Borrower's opinion are more

<<<

 attractive than the alternative.
4

N O R SK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
The current budget for the FPSO project forecasts a total capital expenditure (including financing cost) in the total amount of US$ 290,000,000, of which US$ 171,000,000 has

<<<

 been spent to date, and an expected additional US$ 119,000,000 will need to be injected into the project over the next 8 months up to scheduled completion of the conversion works at the Shipyard in the fourth quarter of 2009. Depending on whether

<<<

 and what sort of employment contract that can be secured, it must be expected that another US$ 10,000,000 - 20,000,000 must be spent prior to the FPSO coming into a revenue-earning position, if at all.
Under the proposed arrangements, the Buyer

<<<

's obligation will be limited to contribution of the Purchase Price, and the Borrower will carry the risk of being able to complete the project on time and on budget, in accordance with the specifications under the conversion contract with the

<<<

 yard.
The Borrower recognizes that for the reason stated above, there will be substantial and continued risk in the project.
The Borrower regretfully admits that the proposal represents a major disappointment compared to initial plans and ambitions

<<<

. The Borrower believes that the FPSO Sale as proposed is the best achievable sale in today's market, and that there is additional risk in awaiting another and better alternative in the uncertain future. For the Bondholders to withhold consent

<<<

 to the proposed FPSO Sale will result in a rather immediate cash problem, which will inter alia suspend and jeopardize the conversion project.
5. Global solution sought by the Borrower
The Borrower has engaged Pareto Securities AS and Bugge

<<<

, Arentz-Hansen & Rasmussen (legal advisor as to Norwegian law) to assist the Borrower in restructuring the Loan and the bond issues "PetroProd Ltd 07/13 10.85% USD C ISIN NO 001036899.6" and "PetroProd Ltd 07/12 8.50% CONV 1S1N NO 00103986

<<<

5.4". NTM has, on behalf of the Bondholders in the Loan as well as the bondholders in the bond issue "PetroProd Ltd 07/13 10.85% USD C ISIN NO 001036899.6", engaged AMA and Bingham, in order to seek such a global solution.
The Borrower intends

<<<

, in co-operation with AMA and Bingham on behalf of NTM and the bondholders, if possible to present such global solution for the three bond loans and the Borrower's equity holders, with the aim of balancing the interests of such parties, as

<<<

 soon as possible.
6. Evaluation of the Proposal
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders should independently evaluate whether the Proposal are acceptable

<<<

.
It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with tax, financial and other advisers as to the possible consequences of the Proposal. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Borrower still has challenges going

<<<

 forward and the Issuer might be unable to meet its commitments in the future. Further information to the Bondholders may be published on www.stamdata.no
