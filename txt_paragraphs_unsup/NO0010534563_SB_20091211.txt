 Callable Bond 2009/2012

Oslo, 11 December 2009

Temporary Waiver of the Leverage Ratio covenant - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issue 

<<<

(the "Loan") where Havila Shipping ASA) is the borrower (the "Borrower" or the "Company").

All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the agreement for the Loan (the "Loan

<<<

 Agreement").

The information in this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.

1. Background

As stated

<<<

 by the company in the report for the third quarter of 2009, the spot market for offshore service vessels was weak during the quarter. Day rates have been low, and over supply of vessels has resulted in low utilisation for both PSVs and AHTS

<<<

. O f owned vessels, the group had two PSVs and one AHTS vessel in the spot marked during the quarter. One of the PSV vessels has in average achieved day rates lower than the operating costs. The AHTS vessel had acceptable day rates, but low

<<<

 utilisation. The spot market in the fourth quarter has also been weak. The company currently has four vessels operating with a loss in the spot market. The weaker spot market for supply vessels during the last couple of quarters, results in

<<<

 need for change in the Leverage Ratio covenant.

The objective o f the group is now to achieve longer contracts for several of the vessels that are

operating in the spot market. The company has announced three new contracts since the

release

<<<

 o f the third quarter results, whereof two on long term. Havila Princess (PSV) and

Havila Faith (PSV) have both entered into three year contracts with Petrobras, with start up in

the first quarter of 2010. The two contracts have an estimated

<<<

 combined value of NOK 300

million. The rate level for longer contracts is better than in the short term market. Increased

subsea activity, will result in an increased demand for vessels specially designed for such

operations. Strict requirements

<<<

 for tonnage quality, emissions and technical competence will

be key factors in the period ahead.
