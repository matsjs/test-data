Update to Bondholders We refer to our previous update to bondholders of 15 September 2016. In that update, we advised that an extension to the backstop date

 in the sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with Bridge Petroleum 2 Limited ("Bridge") had been agreed to 31 October 2016 in return for exclusivity and Bridge agreeing to cover operating costs. Since our last update, substantial work was undertaken

 to complete prospective funders' due diligence. However, on reaching 31 October there were several outstanding components. Accordingly, we elected not to further extend the backstop date to the SPA in order to have greater flexibility to assess

 alternatives. Bridge has now advised that they are unable to complete the transaction under the SPA as a result of one of their proposed funders determining that the Orlando development no longer met their investment criteria. We have been

<<<

 assessing, and continue to assess, alternative options available and will provide further updates as soon as we are in a position to do so.
