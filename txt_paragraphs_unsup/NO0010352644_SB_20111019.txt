The 9.75% Bonds are secured by, inter alia, an assignment of construction contracts in

<<<

 relation to two ultra deep water vessels (as more fully described below). The FRN Bonds are secured by, inter alia, an assignment of construction contracts in relation to a further ultra deep water vessel (as more fully described below). The

<<<

 10.85% Bonds are secured by, inter alia, a pledge over the shares in PetroRig I Pte Ltd ("Rig I"), PetroRig II Pte Ltd ("Rig II") and PetroRig III (the "Pledges").
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Commencement o f Chapter 11 Proceedings
The Debtors are each

<<<

 Singapore incorporated entities, organised as private limited liability companies, for the primary purpose of financing and taking delivery of a new ultra-deepwater, semi-submersible, harsh environment drilling oil rig (each, a "Rig" and collectively

<<<

, the "Rigs").
On May 17, 2009 (the "Petition Date"), each of PetroRig I, PetroRig II and PetroRig III (each individually a "Debtor" and collectively, the "Debtors") filed a petition for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States

<<<

 Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") with the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 filing was made after the 10.85% Bondholders had instructed the 10.85% Loan Trustee to exercise enforcement rights to replace the board of directors at each of the PetroRig

<<<

 entities.
As of the Petition Date, the Debtors estimated that PetroRig I, PetroRig II and PetroRig III each had assets with book values of approximately USD 278,498,656, USD 264,500,516 and USD 366,372.245, respectively.
2.2 The Debtors'Businesses

<<<


The Debtors each contracted with Jurong Shipyard Pte, Ltd ("Jurong") for the construction of their respective Rig. Each Debtor's principal asset was its rights under its respective Rig construction contract with Jurong (each a "Construction

<<<

 Contract" and collectively, the "Construction Contracts"). The total contract price for the first rig ("Rig I") under PetroRig I's Construction Contract ("Construction Contract I") was USD 464,000,000. The total contract price for the second

<<<

 rig ("Rig II") under PetroRig II's Construction Contract ("Construction Contract II") was USD 483,400,000. The total contract price for the third rig ("Rig III") under PetroRig III's Construction Contract ("Construction Contract III") was USD

<<<

 527,300,000. The Rig construction projects were funded by the bonds issued by PetroMena and PetroRig III. Following the sale of Rig I and the Construction Contracts relating to Rigs II and III, the Debtors' principal assets are the proceeds

<<<

 of such sales, which are described further below.
2.3 Larsen Oil & Gas Ltd.
Prior to the Petition Date, Larsen Oil & Gas Ltd. ("LOG") and affiliates (collectively, the "LOG Group") provided project management and business management services

<<<

 to the Debtors pursuant to various management agreements (the "LOG Management Agreements"). On August 13, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Debtors' motion to reject the LOG Management Agreements, as well as a motion to employ Seadrill

<<<

 Deepwater Units Pte Ltd to provide management services with regard to Construction Contract II and Construction Contract III.
The LOG Group submitted proofs of claim in the Debtors' cases totaling over USD 300,000,000. The Debtors filed extensive

<<<

 objections to the proofs of claim. Throughout the bankruptcy proceedings, the LOG Group consistently objected to relief requested by the Debtors, filed numerous of their own contested pleadings and resisted demands for the turnover of critical

<<<

 documents, all of which had the effect of delaying the reorganisation proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court.

<<<

 loans from: (i) PetroRig III to PetroRig I in the amount of USD 18,679,991.61, (ii) PetroRig II to PetroRig I in the amount of USD 1,531,477.62 and (iii) PetroRig III to PetroRig II in the amount of USD 8,821,164.24.
Immediately prior to the

<<<

 Petition Date, the FRN Bondholders provided a secured loan in the aggregate amount of USD 470,000 to PetroRig I, PetroRig II and PetroRig III to fund the filing of the Debtors' bankruptcy petitions.
2.5 Proceeds from Rig Sales
A. Rig I Rig

<<<

 I was sold at a private sale conducted by Jurong in Singapore, pursuant to a settlement agreement that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court. PetroRig I received the excess proceeds of the sale, in the amount of approximately USD 206,000,00

<<<

0, net of certain agreed amounts owing from PetroRig I to Jurong.
B. Rig II Construction Contract II was sold through an open auction process. Following the auction for Construction Contract II, held on September 25, 2009, PetroRig II sold and

<<<

 assigned all of its right, title and interest in Construction Contract II to Diamond Offshore Drilling Limited for approximately USD 238,000,000, plus the assumption of certain liabilities (including approximately USD 251,000,000 owed to Jurong

<<<

).
C. Rig III Construction Contract III was sold through an open auction process. Following the auction for Construction Contract III, held on December 3, 2009, PetroRig III sold and assigned all of its right, title and interest in Construction

<<<

 Contact III to Memolife International - ExploracoesTecnologicas e Investimentos, LDA for USD 271,300,000, plus the assumption of certain liabilities (including approximately USD 288,700,000 owed to Jurong),
D. Other Assets 2,500 linear feet

<<<

 of risers and accompanying buoyancy devices and other rig equipment related to the operation of Rig I (collectively, the "Riser") was sold to Seadrill Offshore AS, Lokkeveien ("Seadrill Offshore") for USD 14,000,000, pursuant to an asset purchase

<<<

 agreement, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on March 25, 2010.
With respect to additional assets in connection with Construction Contract III, PetroRig III sold all of its right, title and interest therein to Rubicon Drilling Services

<<<

 - Aluguer De Equipamentos Technologicos, Unipessoal, LDA (Zona Franca da Madeira) for USD 2,000,000, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on April 27, 2010.
2.6 Bondholder andPetroMena Claims
The

<<<

 Loan Trustee filed claims against the Debtors on behalf of the 9.75% Bondholders and the FRN Bondholders of USD 692,416,286 and USD 274,180,557, respectively. The 10.85% Bondholders do not have a direct claim against the Debtors, but, as a

<<<

 result of the Pledges are entitled to receive any amounts which are payable by the Debtors on account of equity interests in those entities. The bankrupt estate of PetroMena has also filed an unsecured claim of USD 8,250,364 against the Debtors

2.7 The Court Approved Pay-Downs to Bondholders
On August 6, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court approved the payment to the 9.75% Loan Trustee, in the manner provided in the 9.75% Loan Agreement, of USD

<<<

 130,000,000 out of available cash onhand to be applied in payment of amounts due and owing under the 9.75% Bonds.
On April 1, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorising (a) PetroRig I and PetroRig II, collectively, to pay USD 

<<<

210,161,456.27 to the 9.75% Loan Trustee on account and in full satisfaction of all claims for principal and non-default interest under the 9.75% Loan Agreement, and (b) PetroRig III to pay USD 243,596,267.13 to the FRN Loan Trustee on account

<<<

 and in full satisfaction of all claims for principal and non-default interest under the FRN Loan Agreement. Bondholders should be aware that the apportionment of amounts against interest and principal by the Bankruptcy Court is different to

<<<

 how amounts were applied in repayment of the 9.75% Bonds and FRN Bonds by the Loan Trustee.
3. PLAN OF REORGANISATION
The Debtors have filed a liquidation plan of reorganisation under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The purpose of the Plan

<<<

 is to enable the Debtors to liquidate their assets for the benefit of creditors and accomplish the objectives of Chapter 11, in their best interests and the interests of their creditors and interest holders. The Plan will need to be approved

<<<

 by certain classes of creditors that have filed claims against the Debtors but, importantly, not all classes of creditors are entitled to vote on the Plan and, even if they are not entitled to vote, they will still be bound by the terms of

<<<

 the Plan (see further section 3.2 below). In order to become effective, the Plan must be approved by the necessary creditor classes and must be approved or `confirmed' by the Bankruptcy Court. The hearing at which the Bankruptcy Court will

<<<

 be asked to confirm the Plan is scheduled for 2 November 2011 (the "Confirmation Hearing").
3.1 Settlement with Larsen
Prior to the Confirmation Hearing, each of the Debtors and each member of the LOG Group will have executed a claims settlement

<<<

 stipulation (the "LOG Claims Stipulation"). The LOG Claims Stipulation will effect, amongst other things, (i) a settlement of the proofs of claim filed by members of the LOG Group and (ii) a discontinuation of litigation between the Debtors

<<<

 and LOG. The Loan Trustee is not a party to the stipulation.
The LOG Claims Stipulation follows years of litigation amongst the parties, as well as multiple lengthy efforts to negotiate a consensual resolution of the many claims and legal actions

<<<

 between them. Pursuant to the LOG Claims Stipulation, members of the LOG Group will be entitled to an aggregate recovery from the Debtors of USD 5,000,000 to be payable in cash, and to be funded as further described below (the "LOG Distribution

<<<

"). The LOG Claims Stipulation also provides for, amongst other terms, a full release of any and all claims by and among the Debtors and each member of the LOG Group. The stipulation does not impact any ongoing or future litigation between and

<<<

 there are no releases by or to the Loan Trustee incorporated in the LOG Claims Stipulation.
4

NO RSK Tl LLITSM AN N
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
The LOG Distribution shall be funded as follows: (i) USD 4,500,000 will be paid by the Debtors based on

<<<

 an allocation of funding amongst the separate Debtors to be determined by the Debtors, in their sole discretion, prior to the Confirmation Hearing. It is expected that funds in PetroRig II will be used to pay the USD 4,500,000 part of the LOG

<<<

 Distribution. This will reduce the amount of funds available to repay the intercompany loans owed by PetroRig II to PetroRig III, thus resulting in lower available proceeds at PetroRig III and (ii) USD 500,000 shall, effectively be funded by

<<<

 the general class of unsecured creditors of the Debtors by way of a deduction of such amount from the funds which would otherwise be payable to the class of general unsecured creditors (the "Unsecured LOG Contribution").
3.2 Plan Voting
The

<<<

 Plan is subject to creditor vote, and Bankruptcy Court approval for each of the Debtors.
Under a typical plan of reorganisation in US bankruptcy cases, claims paid in full in cash are considered unimpaired and they are not entitled to vote

<<<

 on the plan of reorganisation. Claims that are due to receive less than the full payment due and owing are referred to as impaired, and are entitled to vote on the plan. Claims that receive no distribution at all are deemed to have voted against

<<<

 the plan.
For PetroRig I, there are two classes that will vote on the Plan: (i) a class of general unsecured creditors of PetroRig I, and (ii) the LOG Group. For PetroRig II, there are three classes that will vote on the Plan: (i) a class of

<<<

 general unsecured creditors of PetroRig II; (ii) the LOG Group; and (iii) the 10.85% Bondholders on account of their equity interests in PetroRig II. For PetroRig III, there are four classes that will vote on the Plan: (i) the FRN Bondholders

<<<

 in respect of the secured portion of their claim; (ii) the general unsecured creditors of PetroRig III; (iii) the LOG Group; and (iv) the FRN Bondholders on account of the FRN Deficiency Claim (as discussed further below). Other creditors are

<<<

 either paid in full, and therefore not entitled to vote, or receiving no recovery, and presumed to reject the Plan.
3.3 Plan Confirmation
The results of the voting, and the Plan will be submitted to the Bankruptcy Court on November 2, 2011

<<<

 for approval. If the Bankruptcy Court rules that the Plan does not discriminate unfairly against, and is otherwise fair and equitable, to any impaired class that does not accept the plan, then the Bankruptcy Court may approve the Plan, and

<<<

 the Debtors would then exit the bankruptcy proceedings.
Once the Plan is approved, it is expected that the Debtors will be in a position to distribute payments to the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the 9.75% Bondholders and FRN Bondholders) within

<<<

 a matter of weeks (see further sections 3.4 and 3.5 below).
3.4. Distributions under the Plan
Distributions expected pursuant to the Plan are described below: A. The Secured Claims at Rig I, Rig II and Rig III and the 9.75% Bonds will be paid

<<<

 in full in cash. The 9.75% Bond Claims have been accepted in the aggregate amount of USD 42,980,428.36, representing the aggregate amount of the 9.75% Bond Claims remaining as of August 15, 2011, together with daily interest of USD 11,244.

<<<

60 which accrues from August 15, 2011 until payment to the 9.75% Loan Trustee, using an exchange rate of 1USD : 6.5391 NOK (being the prevailing rate as the date the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions was filed on 17 May 2009).
B. Priority Non

<<<

 Tax Claims (as defined in the Plan) will be paid in full in cash.
5

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
C. The General Unsecured Claims (as defined in the Plan) will be paid in full, less their pro rata share of the Unsecured LOG Contribution

<<<

. The Debtors estimate that holders of a General Unsecured Claim will receive (approximately) a 97.39% recovery on their claim. The claims filed by PetroMena constitute General Unsecured Claims and, accordingly, it is expected that PetroMena

<<<

 will recover in the region of USD 7,500,000 - USD 8,200,000 from the Debtors.
D. The LOG Distribution (the USD 5,000,000 payable in accordance with the terms of the LOG Claims Stipulation) will be partly paid from the Unsecured LOG Contribution

<<<

, and the remainder will be paid by the Debtors.
E. The FRN Bondholders will be paid from the Rig III Proceeds. The total amount of the accepted FRN Bond Claim is USD 40,000,000 Approximately USD 15,000,000 - USD 20.000. 000 will be paid by

<<<

 PetroRig III in cash under the Plan. The FRN Bondholders will retain an unsecured claim for the residual amount of monies owed to them by PetroRig III (in an amount of approximately USD 20,000,000 - USD 25,000,000) (the residual claim being

<<<

 the "Deficiency Claim"). The Deficiency Claim will be paid, to the extent of available funds, from the Liquidation Trust, see section 3.5 below.
F. Intercompany claims owed by and between the Debtors will be paid from the Liquidation Trust

<<<

 (see section 3.3 below). The intercompany claims are due from PetroRig I and PetroRig II to PetroRig III. In aggregate the intercompany claims are over USD 28.000. 000. Recovery on the intercompany claims due from PetroRig I will be from the

<<<

 Liquidation Trust after the claims of all other PetroRig I creditors are paid in full. Recovery on the intercompany claims due from PetroRig II will be paid in full, in cash. It is expected that a total amount of USD 10,000,000 - USD 15,00

<<<

0,000 will be paid by PetroRig I and PetroRig II to PetroRig III on account of intercompany claims.
G. The 10.85% Bondholders will receive interests in the Liquidation Trust on account of their equity interest in PetroRig II.
3.5 Liquidation

<<<

 Trust
After the Plan is approved and consummated, the property of the Debtors, including any cash and any remaining assets of the Debtors, shall vest automatically in a Liquidation Trust for the express purpose of, among other things, enabling

<<<

 a Liquidating Agent to make distributions pursuant to the terms of the Plan. The Liquidating Agent shall be permitted to: (i) wind-up the Debtors' affairs, including making the distributions contemplated by the Plan, (ii) liquidate any remaining

<<<

 assets in a commercially reasonable manner, (iii) investigate, enforce and prosecute any causes of action, (iv) analyse claims filed against the Debtors, and objections thereto, and (v) settle, compromise, dispute, and prosecute claims filed

<<<

 against the Debtors which are disputed, as applicable. As of the Effective Date, the Liquidation Trust is expected to consist of 1) approximately USD 14,000,000 in remaining assets; 2) a disputed claims reserve consisting of approximately USD

<<<

 4,000,000; and 3) a pool of retained proceeds to cover administrative costs of the Liquidation Trust of USD 4,000,000. It is expected that the USD 14,000,000 will be distributed to FRN Bondholders on the effective date of the Plan. Following

<<<

 the effective date, the administrator of the Liquidating Trust will prosecute remaining claims objections. When the claims objections are resolved, any unused administration costs, and amounts remaining in the disputed claims reserve after

<<<

 payment of all outstanding claims, will be distributed to the FRN Bondholders.

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
3.6 Releases and Exculpations
There are also releases and exculpations into the Plan. The Debtors, will release the Loan

<<<

 Trustee, the Bondholders, the Official Creditors Committee and the Liquidating Agent (and each of the parties' professionals, advisors, employees, directors and officers) from any and all claims, interests, obligations, rights, suits, demands

<<<

, damages, causes of action, remedies and liabilities that exist as of the effective date of the Plan or thereafter arising from any act, omission, event or other occurrence that occurred on or prior to the effective date.
Additionally, the

<<<

 Debtors, the Loan Trustee, the Bondholders, the Official Creditors Committee and the Liquidating Agent are exculpated for any acts or omissions taken in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings. Please note, as discussed above, there are

<<<

 no releases between the LOG Group and the Loan Trustee or the Bondholders pursuant to the terms of the Plan.
3.7 Alternative to Plan Approval
If the Plan as presented is not approved, the two (likely) possible alternate outcomes are: (a) the

<<<

 Debtors go into liquidation proceedings; or (b) the Debtors present an alternative plan of reorganisation. If the Debtors were to enter liquidation proceedings, a "chapter 7 trustee" would be appointed, and he/she would hire professionals to

<<<

 review all the transactions before and during the bankruptcy. Either alternative will result in lengthy delays to distributions and could result in decreased distributions to creditors.
5. PAYMENT BY 9.75% BONDHOLDERS TO 10.85% BONDHOLDERS

<<<


As referred to in section 2.1 above, the Chapter 11 proceedings were filed by the Debtors after the 10.85% Bondholders had instructed the 10.85% Loan Trustee to exercise voting rights under the Pledges to replace the boards of directors of

<<<

 those companies. If the boards had not been replaced, it is unlikely that the Chapter 11 petition would have been filed and this may have resulted in lower recoveries for the 9.75% Bondholders.
AMA Capital Partners, the advisor to the Bondholders

<<<

 has therefore proposed that the 9.75% Bondholders make an aggregate USD 5,000,000 payment to the 10.85% Bondholders in recognition of steps taken by them which may have resulted in increased recoveries for the 9.75% Bondholders.
The purpose

<<<

 of the 9.75% Bondholder meeting is to authorise the 9.75% Loan Trustee to make this payment from 9.75% Bond recoveries.
6. EVALUATION
Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by any o f the Loan Trustee, Bingham McCutchen

<<<

 (London) LLP or AMA Capital Partners. Bondholders should independently evaluate the proposals and vote accordingly.
