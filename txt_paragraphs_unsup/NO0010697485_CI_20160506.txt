Aurelia Energy N.V.
Quarterly report For the period ended March 31,2016
FPSO Glas Dowr

Results and main developments for the three months ended March 31, 2016
First quarter results The net result after tax for the first quarter of 2016 amounted

<<<

 to U.S.$37.1 million profit compared to a loss of U.S.$15.0 million for the first quarter of 2015. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2016 was U.S.$80.1 million compared to U.S.$56.1 million for the first quarter of 2015. The financial results

<<<

 for the first quarter of 2016 were mainly impacted by the following:
The SPM division generated U.S.$7.9 million EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 compared to U.S.$10.3 million EBITDA for the first quarter of 2015. SPM results for 2015 were

<<<

 driven by tw o large projects which started in 2014 and achieved significant progress during 2015. In 2016, progress on these SPM projects were in final stages, resulting in lower EBITDA recognition.
EBITDA for the FPSO division for the first

<<<

 quarter of 2016 amounted to U.S.$75.5 million compared to U.S.$45.9 million EBITDA for the first quarter of 2015. The U.S.$29.6 million increase in EBITDA compared to the first quarter of 2015 was mainly driven by a U.S.$23.9 million increase

<<<

 in EBITDA for the FPSO Glas Dowr. This increase in EBITDA was due to the recognition of the largest part of the termination fee following the termination for convenience by ENI. EBITDA for the FPSO Haewene Brim increased by U.S.$8.8 million

<<<

 compared to the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2015 the Haewene Brim suffered from increased maintenance costs and reduced income due to constraints in production levels which was not the case in the first quarter of 2016. EBITDA

<<<

 of the FPSO Aoka Mizu reduced by U.S.$4.8 million as a result of lower tariff income which ceased as of October 1,2015 and lower lease income which ceased as of March 4, 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm

<<<

 increased by U.S.$0.3 million due to higher tariff income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. EBITDA of the FPSO Munin increased by U.S.$0.3 million as a result of cost savings on the lay-up of the vessel in

<<<

 the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. Furthermore FPSO tender costs in 2016 decreased by U.S.$0.8 million, mainly due to lower tender activities compared to the first quarter of 2015. Finally cost savings were achieved

<<<

 on general FPSO costs of U.S.$0.3 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015.
During the first quarter of 2016, unallocated expenses amounted to U.S.$3.4 million, compared to U.S.$0.1 million for the first quarter

<<<

 of 2015. The unallocated expenses for the first quarter of 2016 include a reorganization provision of U.S.$1.3 million. Because of the lower number of contracted staff in the first quarter of 2016 the overall recovery percentage also decreased

<<<

. In the first quarter of 2015 the overhead recovery was relatively high, which was driven by increased project activity and utilization of the engineering staff. Additionally, euro denominated costs decreased as a result of the lower euro 

<<<

- dollar exchange rate during the first quarter of 2015 while in the first quarter of 2016 the euro denominated costs increased.
Depreciation and amortization expenditure for the first quarter of 2016 amounted to U.S.$29.5 million compared to

<<<

 U.S.$36.7 million for the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was mainly driven by impairment of the FPSO Glas Dowr and FPSO Aoka Mizu in December 2015, resulting in a lower depreciation base going forward for both vessels. Furthermore the

<<<

 depreciation for FPSO Glas Dowr ceased as per March 1,2016 as a result of finalization of the decommissioning following the termination of the Glas Dowr contract. FPSO Glas Dowr is now classified as FPSO under construction.
Finance expenses

<<<

 were U.S.$0.3 million higher compared to the previous year, at U.S.$15.6 million versus U.S.$15.3 million in the first quarter of 2015. The amendment agreements to the senior secured project finance facility and to the corporate credit facility

<<<

 have led to one off additional amortization expenditures of debt arrangement fees of U.S.$1.3 million due to recalculation of the debt arrangement fees over the remainder period of the facility's. In total an amount of U.S.$6.5 million was

<<<

 added to the debt arrangement fees.
2

Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$1.0 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to further reduction of net debt. Currency exchange results were U.S.$2.5 million positive in the first quarter

<<<

 of 2016 compared to U.S.$16.3 million negative in the first quarter of 2015. The currency exchange results relate mainly to positive or negative fair market value of euro denominated forward exchange contracts that were entered into to hedge

<<<

 the currency exposure on SPM projects. Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2016 amounted U.S.$0.3 million versus U.S.$2.8 million for the first quarter of 2015. The income tax expense in 2016 fully relates to withholding tax in relation

<<<

 to the Glas Dowr revenues. The U.S.$2.8 million income tax expense in 2015 relates to U.S.$1.5 million withholding tax incurred in relation to the Glas Dowr revenues, U.S.$0.6 million withholding tax incurred in relation to SPM revenues and

<<<

 U.S.$0.7 million corporate taxes in other jurisdictions. Other developments On February 9, 2016, the Company entered into amendment agreements to the senior secured project finance facility and to the corporate credit facility. The repayment

<<<

 schedule for the senior secured project finance facility has been updated in accordance with the provisions of the facility to reflect the current position in relation to prepayments. The corporate credit facility had an original expiry date

<<<

 of March 4, 2016 and the Company has agreed an extension until March 31,2017. The corporate credit facility is split between a U.S.$22.2 million RCF 1 and a U.S.$44.5 million RCF 2. Interest on RCF 1 is 3-months USD Libor plus 4% margin per

<<<

 annum plus an additional margin (the deferred margin) of 1% per annum, interest on RCF 2 is 3-months USD Libor plus 3% margin per annum. On March 1,2016, the Company received a notice of termination of the contract with Nexen for the FPSO Aoka

<<<

 Mizu producing from the Ettrick field. Production will cease on June 1,2016 and decommissioning of the vessel will start from that date. Redeployment opportunities for the FPSO Aoka Mizu are actively being pursued. FPSO Glas Dowr left the Kitan

<<<

 field on February 27, 2016. The Company is addressing outstanding contractual matters with the client to establish final close out and reach settlement of the last portion of the remaining termination fee payment.

General information Aurelia

<<<

 Energy N.V. (``the Company'') is the holding company of the Bluewater group (Bluewater), a specialized service provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates floating production storage

<<<

 and offloading units (``FPSOs''), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops, performs project management and constructs single point mooring systems (``SPMs''). An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used

<<<

 by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either newly built or converted tankers upon which production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and water) are processed on board

<<<

 the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported to an off take system utilizing shuttle tankers. Bluewater's fleet of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling phase of oil field

<<<

 development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- and long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts. SPMs are used to transfer fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker while

<<<

 securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. Most SPMs consist of an anchoring system that is connected to the ocean floor and a fluid transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids between fixed and rotating parts of the mooring

<<<

 system. SPMs are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors. Revenues are earned from day rates consisting of a fixed facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases with oil companies, supplemented

<<<

 from time to time with fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various

<<<

 FPSO and SPM projects being managed. FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial design and engineering phase to final installation. Further, Bluewater engages subcontractors in the fabrication of FPSOs, SPMs and auxiliary equipment

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Reporting entity Aurelia Energy N.V. (``the Company

<<<

'') has its legal seat in Willemstad (Curasao). The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the period ended March 31,2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as

<<<

 ``the Group'' or ``Bluewater'' and individually as ``Group entities'') and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities.
Statement of compliance The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using

<<<

 accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements.
Basis of preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are

<<<

 presented in thousands of US dollars, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared

<<<

 using accounting policies consistent with the recognition and measurement criteria of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements. The information furnished in the unaudited

<<<

 interim condensed consolidated financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of such financial statements. Although the Company

<<<

 believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements

<<<

 and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31,2015.
The preparation of these unaudited interim financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies

<<<

 and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in

<<<

 the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the

<<<

 amounts recognised in the unaudited interim financial statements are:
 Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned with

<<<

 the leased facilities;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forward;  Potential impact of claims and litigation;  Going concern considerations.

1. Segment information
The disclosure of segment information is consistent

<<<

 with the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segment's performance and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments since the

<<<

 Company's risks and rates of return are affected primarily by differences in services and products produced.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on

<<<

 a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly employee benefits expense, head office expenses, investments and related revenue and income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues.
