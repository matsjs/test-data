To approve the

<<<

 resolutions, Bondholders representing a simple majority of the Voting Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to form a quorum, at least half (1/2) of the Voting Bonds must be represented

<<<

 at the Bondholders' Meeting. Please find attached a Bondholder's form from the Securities Register (VPS), indicating your holding of Bonds at the printing date. The form will serve as proof of ownership of Bonds and of the voting rights at

<<<

 the Bondholders' Meeting. If the Bonds are held by a custodian, i.e. that the owner is not registered directly in the VPS, the custodian must confirm: (i) the owner of the Bonds; (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds; and (iii) the

<<<

 account number in VPS in which the Bonds are registered. The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's form, authorising

<<<

 the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is shceduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this summons for further details). If the Bonds have been transferred

<<<

 to a new owner after the Bondholder's form was completed, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership

<<<

 of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or email (as set out on the first page

<<<

 of this summons) within 16:00 hours (4 p.m.) CET on the Business Day before the date of the Bondholders' Meeting. Yours sincerely
Enclosed: Bondholder's form
