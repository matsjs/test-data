2. BACKGROUND
SeaBird's parent, Seabird Exploration PLC (the "Parent"), recorded a 36.4% active vessel utilisation during the first quarter of 2017, with three vessels

<<<

 contracting lead-time remains long with substantial competition and high market uncertainty. The Group continues to proactively optimise its cost base to improve its relative cost position in the 2D and source markets.
As a result o f significant

<<<

 market uncertainty, negative cash flow development for the first half of the year as well as upcoming debt maturities in 2017 and Q1 2018, the Issuer has together with its financial advisors set forth a restructuring proposal to the Bondholders

<<<

 (the "Restructuring"), as

 f the Bonds in the form o f additional Bonds, and (iii) a standstill for the payment of the interest payment due 3 June 2017 (including for the avoidance of doubt any default interest) until 15 August 2017.

Risk factors
ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS In addition to the risks set out in the prospectus for

<<<

 the 2015 equity offering, the risks set out below also apply to the current bond issue. Further, any risks to the operations and financial position of the Group set out hereunder or in the 2015 Prospectus may materially adversely affect the

<<<

 Issuer's ability to service its bonds and other debt, the Obligors' ability to meet their obligations under the Company's finance documents and the trading price of the Company's bonds. This section is not intended to be exhaustive - additional

<<<

 risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Issuer, or that they currently deem immaterial, may also impair the Issuer's business operations or the trading price of the Bonds. All risks to the Issuer's ability to service bonds and other

<<<

 debt may also apply to the other Obligors' ability to meet their obligations under the Company's finance documents.
RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY
The Company and Group's ability to service its debt obligations is fully dependent upon a successful

<<<

 restructuring of the Group and of additional financing in the near future. The Company and Group is currently unable to service certain of its financing agreements. The survival of the Group, and its future financial condition and profitability

<<<

 of its operations is reliant on a successful restructuring of the Group, including its debt arrangements, financial and operational agreements including renegotiation and termination of certain chartering arrangements, as well as successful

<<<

 refinancing. Additional financing will not have been obtained by the date of the restructuring. If any part of the restructuring is not completed or otherwise successful, it is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition

<<<

 of the Group and the Issuer's ability to obtain required additional financing.
The Com pany's ability to service its debt obligations is fully dependent upon a continued successful implementation of the business plan. The Issuer is following

<<<

 a comprehensive business plan aimed at bringing the Group to profitable operations upon improvement of general market conditions. The continued successful implementation of this business plan and meeting the targets set out therein is highly

<<<

 important for the Company and Group's financial condition, future profitability and ability to service the Company's debt obligations. The business plan contains several sensitive issues and assumptions, many of which will be decisive for its

<<<

 success. If the Group is unable to continue to adapt to prevailing market conditions and implement the business plan in full, any part of the business plan fails to deliver the anticipated results or any of the assumptions on which it is based

<<<

 prove to be incorrect, it is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Group and the Company's ability to service its debt obligations.
Further issu e of shares in th e Com pany is required and the term s are

<<<

 not clarified The Company requires additional capital, and will seek to issue shares to investors in the near future. It is not clear at what terms new equity will be available (if at all), and shareholders may therefore be subject to transactions

<<<

 which significantly dilute their shareholding. There can be no assurance of the level of dilution of the shareholders which will be the result of any new share issue. In the future, further share capital increases may be necessary, and the

<<<

 same considerations would apply in such case.
Share price volatility and liquidity The SeaBird share price could experience substantial fluctuations caused by a number of factors. Many of these will be outside the Company's control and may

<<<

 be independent of its operational and financial development. The factors which may affect the share price include, but is not limited to, matters such as reactions to quarterly and annual reports published by the Company, changes in analysts

<<<

' estimates, changes in the seismic industry in general, changes in market and financial prospects, rumours and speculation in the market and the general sentiment in the stock market. There can be no assurance as to the liquidity of the market

<<<

 for the Company's shares or shareholders' ability to sell the shares.
Market conditions in the Com pany's industry The market conditions for the Company continues to the very challenging, and there can be no assurance of whether, or when, such

<<<

 conditions will improve. Said market conditions severely and adversely affect the Company's ability to generate backlog and profits, and said conditions may continue in the future.

Risk factors cont'd
RISKS RELATED TO THE COM PANY'S DEBT
The Group will continue to have substantial indebtedness Pursuant to the Com pany's debt obligations,

<<<

 including its bonds, the Group w ill have substantial indebtedness which may lim it the flexibility of its operations, its business, its financial capability and its ability to satisfy its obligations under the bond agreem ent and its other

<<<

 agreem ents, which could have negative consequences for the creditors and other stakeholders. Further, cross default provisions may be triggered by non-performance of any m em ber of the Group and m ay in certain situations be continuing even

<<<

 if the original default has been rem edied. This m ay cause a situation w here the Group and the Company are required to prepay a substantial am ount of their total indebtedness prior to its scheduled maturity.
The Com pany's cash flow m ay

<<<

 not be sufficient to service the Com pany's debt obligations In addition to additional equity capital in the near future, the Com pany is reliant on its subsidiaries to provide revenue and cash flow for it to service its debt obligations. If

<<<

 the subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or such cash flow is not available to the Issu er to service its debts, the Issuer m ay need to obtain further financing than scheduled. Inability to obtain such

<<<

 refinancing or financing may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, and going concern position.
Th ere is only a lim ited tra d in g m arket fo r the C om p an y's bonds The liquidity of the m arket for

<<<

 the Com pany's bonds will depend on the num ber of holders of those bonds, investor interest at large and relative to the Issuer and its business segm ent in particular, and the interest of securities dealers in m aking a m arket in those securities

<<<

 and other factors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of the m arket for the Com pany's bonds or bondholders' ability to sell the bonds.
The m arket price of the Com pany's bonds m ay be volatile The m arket price of

<<<

 the Com pany's bonds could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to actual o r anticipated variations in the G roup's operating results and those of its com petitors, adverse business developm ents, changes to the regulatory environm

<<<

 ent in which the Group operates, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and the actual or expected sale of a large num ber of bonds, interest rates as well as other factors.
The Group m ay incur additional indebtedness Despite

<<<

 the Group's current levels of indebtedness, Group com panies m ay in the future incur substantially more debt, including in relation to new vessel and equipm ent leases, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with its substantial

<<<

 indebtedness and adversely affect its ability to service the bonds and their trading price.

The bond agreem ent fo r the Com pany's bonds w ill contain provisions perm itting the Trustee or certain defined m ajorities to m ake decisions binding fo r all bondholders The bond agreem ent contains provisions for calling m eetings

 of bondholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions perm it defined m ajorities to bind all bondholders, including bondholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant m eeting and bondholders who voted

. However, it is possible that the Issuer m ay not have sufficient funds at the tim e of the change of control event to m ake th e required redemption of bonds. The Company's failure to redeem tendered bonds would constitute an event of default

<<<

 of a m andatory prepaym ent event, it m ay not be possible fo r bondholders to reinvest such proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the bonds and m ay only be able to do so at a significantly low er rate. It

<<<

 is further possible that the Com pany will not have sufficient funds at the time of the mandatory prepaym ent event to make the required redemption of bonds.
The Com pany's bonds and their security m ay rank ju n io r to certain preferred claim

 s As a general m atter, the Com pany's liabilities in respect of the Com pany's bonds may, in the event of a bankruptcy o r insolvency proceeding o r sim ilar proceeding, rank junior to certain of the Issuer's liabilities that may be entitled

 to priority under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, including maritim e liens. Further, the laws the jurisdictions in which the Com pany's vessels may operate m ay give rise to the existence of m aritim e liens which m ay take priority

<<<

 over the liens securing the Com pany's bonds. Such liens may arise in support of, among other things, claim s by unpaid ship builders o r ship repairers rem aining in possession o f the vessels and claim s for salvage. Maritim e liens can som

<<<

. The enforcem ent o f rights as a bondholder across m ultiple jurisdictions m ay prove difficult. Furtherm ore, in the event any bondholder's rights as a bondholder have been infringed, it m ay be difficult to enforce judgm ents against the

<<<

 Issuer o r its directors or m anagem ent. The Issuer is incorporated in Cyprus and the guarantors are incorporated under the law s of Cyprus, Singapore and Norway. The vessels are registered in the ship registries of various jurisdictions and

<<<

 operate globally. Their business is operated prim arily from offices in Oslo, Singapore, Cyprus, Huston, Odessa, St. Petersburg and Dubai. Local laws may prevent or restrict bondholders from enforcing a judgm ent against the Group's assets

<<<

, the assets of its senior managers, the assets of the Parent and/or the assets of the directors or management of the parent.
A n y bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings m ay involve Cypriot, N orw egian and Singaporean insolvency law As the

<<<

 Issuer is incorporated in Singaporean and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Cyprus, Norw ay and Singaporean, an insolvency proceeding relating to an Obligor, even if brought in another jurisdiction, would likely involve Cypriot

 insolvency laws and possibly Norwegian and Singaporean insolvency law, the procedural and substantive provisions of which m ay differ from com parable provisions of those of other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar.
Follow ing

<<<

 a default, the Trustee m ay not be able to realize any or all of the security It may be difficult or even impossible for the Trustee to enforce the security. In particular, the enforcement of vessel mortgages (including the ones to be provided

<<<

 over each of the vessels) can be complicated, very costly, convoluted and tim e consuming. For example, it can be difficult to locate the vessels without the assistance of a specialist agency, or problem atic to enforce the m ortgage as it

<<<

 would be subject to the laws o f the place w here the vessel is situated at the tim e o f enforcem ent. Even if the initial arrest o f either o f the vessels is achieved, the process (if any) by which it can be sold and the proceeds ultim ately

<<<

 realized varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These issues further increase the risk that, after the enforcem ent of the security, following deduction o f all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcem ent, there

<<<

 may be insufficient funds to settle am ounts owed under the bonds. These and other factors relating to a forced sale o f collateral could result in the bondholders losing all o r part o f th eir investm ent.
