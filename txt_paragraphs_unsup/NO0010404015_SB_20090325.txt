2. PROPOSED EXTENSION OF THE GRACE PERIOD
Based on the initial request from the Borrower, the extension

<<<

 that was granted, and the protest that was received, the Loan Trustee now convenes a Bondholders' meeting to consider the proposed extension of the grace period. The Borrower proposes that the Bondholders accept to extend the grace period for

<<<

 paying interest until 3 April 2009. The extension will allow the Borrower more time to reach an agreement and formalize the solution with the Bondholders.

It is also proposed that the Loan Trustee shall be granted the authority to, on the

<<<

 behalf of the Bondholders, and at the Loan Trustee's discretion, to further successively extend the grace period in the time period after 3 April 2009 however, not longer than until 4 May 2009. The basis for giving such extensions shall be

<<<

 that the Borrower is in a dialogue with Bondholders, and that there appears to be progress in the process. If such extensions are given, they shall be announced on www.Stamdata.no

The Interest of the Loan shall be increased with 5.00 per cent

<<<

 p.a. so that the principal and outstanding interest amount of the Loan shall accrue interest at NIBOR + Margin + 5 per cent p.a. with effect from the interest due date 17 March. 2009 until the date such payment is made, or until the issue of

<<<

 interest payment is otherwise solved through an agreement with the Bondholders formalized by a Bondholders' meeting (whichever occurs first). The increased interest rate reflects the interest rate of the Loan if the Loan was declared in default

<<<

.

The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

It is recommended that the Bondholders

<<<
