Summons to Bondholders' Meetings - Restructuring Proposal

1. INTRODUCTION

<<<



Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("the "Loan Trustee") has been appointed as loan trustee in the bond issues consisting of ISIN NO 001 032446.0 (the "2009 Bond"), ISIN NO 001 034615.8 (the "2010 Bond"), and ISIN NO 001 039816.7 (the "2012 Bond" and together

<<<

 with the 2009 Bond and the 2010 Bond, the "Loans") where Artumas Group Inc ("Artumas" or the "Company" or the "Borrower") is issuer and borrower.

All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreements

<<<

 for the Loans (the "Loan Agreements") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.

The information regarding the operational and financial status of the Company and market conditions is provided by the Company, and

<<<

 the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

2. CORPORATE UPDATE AND BACKGROUND

Please see Exhibit 1 for a corporate update and background for the proposal set out below.

3. PROPOSAL

The Company

<<<

 proposes that the Bondholders convert the total outstanding principal

amount of the Loans, including accrued but unpaid interest as at 28 May 2009, into

common shares in Artumas and that interest no longer accrue from said date (the

"Proposal

<<<

").

® NORSIC TILLITSMANN ASA

The total

<<<

 principal amount outstanding in the Loans is USD 115,000,000, plus accrued unpaid interest which amounts to USD 2,049,444 per 28 May 2009.

The Proposal implies that the Loans including accrued but unpaid interest up to 28 May 2009 (with no

<<<

 further interest accruing from such date) shall be converted to common shares in Artumas at a conversion price of NOK 1 per share based on a USD/NOK exchange rate of 6.4130, which was the exchange rate on 11 May 2009 at 12.00 CET (the "Conversion

<<<

").

Following the Conversion, 750,638,087 new common shares will be issued to the Bondholders (as a whole number of shares will be issued to each Bondholder, the number may be subject to minor adjustment), representing approximately a 95.4

<<<

 per cent shareholding in Artumas post-completion of the Conversion. The shareholding in Artumas will then be divided between existing shareholders and former Bondholders as follows:

% ownership 4,6 %
8.5 % 29,8 % 57,1 % 100 %

In order to secure the Company's funding requirements, an invitation to subscribe in a private placement (the "Private

<<<

 Placement") of USD 20 to 30 million will be made to certain existing shareholders, the Bondholders, and potential new investors. The subscription price in the Private Placement shall not be lower than NOK 0.25 per share.

The Company will,

<<<

 following the Private Placement, consider to conduct a subsequent offering of up to USD 10 million (the "Subsequent Offering") to all shareholders (being shareholders prior to the Conversion) who were not invited to participate in the Private

<<<

 Placement (subject to applicable securities law which may restrict such offering and subscription into and from certain jurisdictions). The price in the Subsequent Offering will be equal to the subscription price in the Private Placement. The

<<<

 amount raised in the Private Placement and the Subsequent Offering will thus, in aggregate, not exceed USD 40 million.

The table below shows the shareholdings in Artumas post the Conversion and post the Private Placement and the Subsequent

<<<

 Offering in different scenarios depending on amount of equity and with a pricing, for illustrative purposes, of NOK 0.25 per share in the Private Placement and the Subsequent Offering (since the size of the equity offerings are indicated in

<<<

 USD, the number of shares emerging from the Private Placement and the Subsequent Offering will depend on the USD/NOK exchange rate at the time of settlement):

<<<

09 Bond and the 2010 Bond, with regard to Equity Ratio, Equity and Net Current Assets up until 30 June 2009, and in Clause 16.3 with regard to Equity Ratio, Equity and Working Capital and Clause 18.1(d)(i) of the Loan Agreement for the 2012

<<<

 Bond, in the period up until 30 June 2009.

The Proposal is subject to the Private Placement of minimum USD 20 million and maximum USD 30 million being fully subscribed within 10 June 2009 and fully paid in on or about 19 June 2009.

The Proposal

 is further subject to approval of the shareholders of the Borrower. An extraordinary general meeting is for this purpose scheduled to be held on or about 5 June 2009.

Furthermore, the Proposal is subject to the approval from the Bondholders

' Meeting in all three Loans.

For further information about

 the Company, please refer to its web site www.artumas.com.

® NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
Bondholders may also contact the Company's Advisor, DnB NOR Markets for further information:
Einar Wold (einar.wold@dnbnor.no / +47 22 01 77 88); Preben Grevstad

<<<

 (preben.grevstad@dnbnor.no / +47 22 94 88 98); Frode Sævig (frode.savig@dnbnor.no / +47 22 94 81 32) or; Pål Vammervold (pal.vammervold@dnbnor.no / +47 22 01 77 64)
The Advisor is acting solely for the Company and no-one else in connection

<<<

 with the Proposal. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by the Advisor with respect to the Company and the Advisor expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal (including but not limited

<<<

 to the information contained herein and in the Corporate Update enclosed to this Summons!.
4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
4.1 The Company's evaluation
Based on the information given in the Corporate Update, Artumas believes it is in

<<<

 the best interest of all stakeholders to consider the Proposal set forth in these, which could result in Artumas having a clean balance sheet being able to raise new capital, and could ensure that Artumas avoids having to obtain creditor protection

<<<

 or be wound-up. In order to attract new capital through an equity issue, a debt-free balance sheet is deemed necessary. According to Artumas, the Proposal is the result of an intense review process by the Company, and after having reviewed

<<<

 all potential alternatives, the Company believes this Proposal is in the best interest of the Company. With a clean balance sheet, following an approval of the conversion of all the Loans to equity, Artumas and its Advisor would seek to offer

<<<

 new shares to certain existing shareholders, its Bondholders as well as potential new investors through a private placement.
Artumas therefore proposes that the Bondholders convert the total outstanding principal amount of the Loans (which

<<<

 are all unsecured), including accrued but unpaid interest as at May 28, 2009, into common shares in Artumas and that interest no longer accrue from said date.
4.2 The Loan Trustee's evaluation
The Loan Trustee would have preferred that the

<<<

 Bondholders had been given more information of the economical situation of the Company, as requested by the Loan Trustee. Based on the information provided by the Company herein and in the attached Corporate Update, the Loan Trustee is not

<<<

 in a position to make any recommendation with regard to the Proposal, and the Proposal is, consequently, put forward without any further evaluations or recommendation from the Loan Trustee.
The Bondholders must independently evaluate, based

<<<

 on available information, whether the Proposal is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders counsel with tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences of the Proposal. All Bondholders must be aware that even

<<<

 if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has

V NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
challenges going forward and the Company might be unable to meet its commitments in the future. The Loan Trustee also points out that the Proposal is a proposal presented

<<<

 to the Loan Trustee by the Borrower and that the Loan Trustee has not been involved in negotiations or had any influence on the Proposal.

Please find attached as Exhibit 2 a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as

Operation Update - Mozambique
Mozambique Rovuma Onshore Block: Artumas (currently 49.3%), Anadarko Petroleum Limited (35.7% - operator), and Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetas E.N.H. (15%). Over 640 Kms of new 2-D seismic data was acquired

<<<

 in 2008 within the Block. Mapping has identified a significant number of highly prospective leads within the Tertiary oil prone play and the Cretaceous and Jurassic gas prone plays. Final drilling location for the first well is expected to

<<<

 be determined in Q2 2009. The operator is currently sourcing a land rig for commencement of drilling in Q4 2009.
As a result of the Company's recent farm out efforts, an MOU has been signed with a potential new joint venture partner, under

<<<

 which Artumas agrees to transfer half of its interest in the Onshore Rovuma Block ("Onshore Rovuma"). Upon formal closure of this transaction, the outstanding interests of the respective concessionaires would be: Artumas 24.65%, new partner

 partners Artumas (8.5%), Mitsui E&P (20%), Videocon (10%), Bharat Petroleum (10%) and Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetas E.P. (15%). Over 3,300 sq. km. of 3-D seismic data was acquired in

A separate MOU has

 potential additional net gas resource of in excess of 1,600 bcf (P10). This upside potential is incremental to the resource base discovered and independently audited by RPS-APA for the Mnazi Bay and Msimbati gas fields and provides additional

<<<

 support for the current portfolio of commercialization options being pursued by Artumas as a gas supplier.
The farm out process of the Mnazi Bay concession is progressing, with Artumas considering the sale of a majority (operating) interest

.
Tanzania Mtwara Energy Project: The downstream sales process of the Company's power assets is also progressing, with Artumas considering an outright sale of this business to enable the Company to focus on growing its Upstream E&P business

Financial Update
Artumas expects to release its full Q1 2009 financial results on May 26, 2009. These results are expected to continue to indicate a potential going concern issue which was fully disclosed in the year end 2008 audited financial

<<<

 statements. The global financial crisis has made it very difficult to raise new equity or sell assets.
A full review of all aspects of the Company's operations commenced in the fall of 2008. Based on resulting cost-control initiatives, Artumas

<<<

 expects to reduce combined G&A and Field Operations costs from approximately US$47m in 2008 to approximately US$16m on a normalized annual basis going forward.
As at March 31, 2009 cash and cash equivalents were US$12.5m. Following the Company

<<<

's substantial cost cutting measures the monthly Operating and G&A costs are forecast to be US$2.5m per month. Subject to the proposal made to the Bondholders as further described herein, interest payments coming due within Q2 will be US$4.

<<<

2m, out of which US$2.1 million falls due on May 22, 2009, and principal payment of US$10.0m under the 2009 Bond falls due on June 30, 2009. Remaining unfunded capital commitments for 2009 are estimated to be US$ 35.0m, US$ 25.0m for 2010 and

<<<

 US$ 9 for 2011, without consideration for the potential farm-out transactions noted above. As the majority of the capital expenditures will occur on drilling programs in Mozambique, implementation of the farm-out agreements would dramatically

<<<

 reduce capital obligations of Artumas through 2009 and 2010.
Although Artumas has been working diligently on the farm-out process the last year (with Tristone Capital as advisor from Q3 2008), and the completion of a sale of assets or farm

<<<

-out is possible prior to the June 30 maturity date of the 2009 Bond, the Company does not anticipate that any of the proceeds from such asset sales, or from any other possible sources of funds, will be received by the Company until earliest

<<<

 Q3 2009. Taking into account the current financial situation of the Company, there is consequently a risk that the Company will not be able to finance the repayment of the 2009 Bond Issue on June 30, 2009.
Bondholder Proposal
In March 2009

<<<

 Artumas engaged DnB NOR Markets, a part of DnB NOR Bank ASA, to advise it on a potential refinancing of the Company.
2

The Company has considered all the possible alternatives for the Company in the current situation, having regard to the

<<<

 Company's financial position as set out above, the current economic climate and the risk to the licences required for its operations.
In the event that the Company, should be unable to meet cash calls under its development programs, there is

<<<

 a serious risk under the relevant asset agreements and applicable local petroleum laws that the local governments in Tanzania and Mozambique will have the right to cancel, terminate or require the transfer without consideration of the relevant

<<<

 interests in the event of such non-payment of the relevant commitments. Such outcomes could also present a significant risk for loss of licences if the Company consequently seeks creditor protection or enters into insolvency proceedings in

<<<

 the future. Any loss of licences could have a substantial negative effect on the Company's operations and financial condition, which again could have a significant negative effect for the bondholders under the Company's issued bonds.
Based

<<<

 on the above, Artumas believes it is in the best interest of all stakeholders to consider the proposal set forth in the Summons for Bondholder's meeting as of today's date, which could result in Artumas having a clean balance sheet being able

<<<

 to raise new capital, and could ensure that Artumas avoids having to obtain creditor protection or be wound-up. In order to attract new capital through an equity issue, a debt-free balance sheet is deemed necessary. The proposal is the result

<<<

 of an intense review process by the Company, and after having reviewed all potential alternatives, the Company believes this proposal is in the best interest of the Company. With a clean balance sheet, following approval of the conversion of

<<<

 all the Bond Loans to equity, Artumas and its financial advisor would seek to offer new shares to certain existing shareholders, its bondholders as well as potential new investors through a private placement.
Artumas therefore proposes that

<<<

 the Bondholders convert the total outstanding principal amount of the 2009 Bond, the 2010 Bond and the 2012 Bond (together the "Bond Loans") (which are all unsecured), including accrued but unpaid interest as at May 28, 2009, into common shares

<<<

 in Artumas and that interest no longer accrue from said date. The full details of the proposal are set out in the summons to bondholders' meetings dated May 12, 2009.
The total principal amount outstanding in the Bond Loans) is US$115,000,

<<<

000, plus accrued unpaid interest which amounts to US$2,049,444 per May 28, 2009. The Company has no other significant financial creditors.
The Bond Loans including accrued but unpaid interest up to May 28, 2009 (with no further interest accruing

<<<

 from such date) would be converted to common shares at a conversion price of NOK 1 per share based on a US$/NOK exchange rate of 6.4130, which was the exchange rate on 11 May 2009 at 12:00 Oslo time. Following the conversion, approx. 750,6

<<<

38,087 new common shares will be issued to the bondholders under the Bond Loans, representing approx, a 95.4 per cent shareholding in the Company post-completion of the conversion, but prior to the Private Placement and any Subsequent Offering

<<<

 as described below.
The Proposal is subject to a Private Placement of US$ 20 to 30 million being fully subscribed within June 10, 2009 and fully paid on or about June 19, 2009. The subscription price in the Private Placement shall not be lower

<<<

 than NOK 0.25 per share. The Company will following the Private Placement consider to conduct a Subsequent Offering of up to US$ 10 million to all shareholders (being shareholders prior to the Conversion) who were not invited to participate

<<<

 in the Private Placement (subject to applicable securities law which may restrict such offering and subscription into and from certain jurisdictions). The price in the Subsequent Offering will be equal to the subscription price in the Private

<<<

 Placement.
Cameron Barton, Acting President and Chief Executive Officer of Artumas, comments, "The proposed restructuring of Artumas and the successful farm outs in Mozambique, if approved by all parties, will result in a very different company

<<<

: we will have no debt and a much reduced overhead; we will retain significant upside through the initial stage of exploration drilling in the highly prospective Rovuma basin both onshore and offshore Mozambique while having the cost of that

<<<

 exploration fully carried; we will have the time to add value in Tanzania through finalizing the enabling contractual arrangements with TPDC and on the MEP prior to bringing in a partner on the upstream acreage which retains significant upside

<<<

 potential for further discovery of hydrocarbons"
