 Rig Company AS) Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2014/2019
Oslo, 16 September 2016

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - WAIVER OF COVENANTS
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders of the bonds (the "Bonds

<<<

") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where NorAm Drilling Company AS (formerly Global Rig Company AS) (the "Issuer", and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group") is the issuer.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have

<<<

 the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 3 June 2014, as amended and restated by an amendment and restatement agreement dated 30 October 2015, and made between the Bond Trustee and the Issuer (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise

<<<

CURRENT TRADING AND MARKET

<<<

 UPDATE

The Issuer has currently 9 land based oil and gas drilling rigs, of which 6 are currently in operation spread across Louisiana, New Mexico and Texas (together, the "Rigs" (as such term is defined in the Bond Agreement)). The Rigs are

<<<

 currently owned by the Issuer's wholly owned subsidiary NorAm Drilling Company (a US subsidiaiy).

By 1 November 2016, the Group will have 8 of its 9 drilling rigs operating. Six rigs are currently operating under short-term (3-month) contracts

<<<

 or well-to-well type contracts. Two of the Group's idle rigs have been contracted to begin work in the middle of October 2016 and 1 November 2016, respectively. One is on another short-term contract through the end of 2016 and the other is

<<<

 on a 14month contract that will carry through year-end 2017. All eight rigs under contract are in the Permian Basin, which includes west Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Throughout the current market downturn, the Permian Basin has been the

<<<

 most active amongst all the major US onshore basins and is expected to remain so through the first half of 2017.

The Issuer has throughout the current period of market downturn continued to monitor its Bond covenants, in particular ratios

<<<

 based on minimum cash and equity, which continue to be impacted by

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

the prevailing oil price. The low commodity price environment means that the Group's current forecasts

<<<

, utilizing the oil price forward curve, project non-compliance with certain of its Bond covenants, and the Issuer has concluded that there will likely be a covenant breach in relation to the Equity Ratio covenant in the third quarter of 20

<<<

16 and a breach in relation to the Liquidity covenant in connection with the scheduled amortization in December 2016.

In order to allow the Issuer a stable platform and necessary time to assess and explore options with Bondholders regarding

<<<

 a strategic review of the Group's capital structure, the Issuer is seeking the Bondholders' consent for a temporary waiver of the Liquidity covenant and Equity Ratio covenant as described herein.

While the Issuer faces a likely covenant breach

<<<

, the Issuer has sufficient cash to pay, and intends to pay, the scheduled instalment and interest payment due on 3 December 2016 under the Bond Agreement.

WAIVERS

The Issuer proposes that the Bondholders temporarily waive the covenant

<<<

 set out in clause 13.7 (a) (Equity Ratio) and that the requirement to maintain a minimum Liquidity set out in clause 13.7 (b) is reduced from USD 10.0 million to USD 7.0 million (the "Waivers").

The Issuer proposes that the Waivers are granted

<<<

 for a period until 30 June 2017, and that the abovementioned clauses after such point in time shall continue to apply with full force and effect as set out in the Bond Agreement.
