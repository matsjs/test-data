Funding and Operational Update
Highlights
 Iona has received

<<<

 unanimous written support from an ad hoc committee of bondholders, representing 64% of the outstanding Bonds, for its recommended transaction proposal to re-finance the Company's bond debt.
 The proposal remains subject to the approval of

<<<

 a two thirds majority of Bondholders attending a Bondholder meeting which is expected in July/August.
 The recommended proposal, if implemented, is intended to ensure that the Company is fully funded for the Orlando project.
 The Huntington

<<<

 field production continues to perform above budget expectations.
Iona Energy Inc., a Canadian independent oil & gas company with assets in the UK North Sea announces to shareholders and bondholders that it has received unanimous written support

<<<

 from an ad hoc committee of bondholders (the "Ad Hoc Committee"), representing 64% of the outstanding Bonds, for its recommended transaction proposal (the "Transaction Proposal"). This follows Iona presenting to the Ad Hoc Committee a range

<<<

 of alternatives to enable the funding of the Orlando project to achieve first oil and/or the refinancing of the Bonds. The recommended Transaction Proposal, if implemented, is intended to ensure that the Company is fully funded for the Orlando

<<<

 project.
There is no guarantee that the Transaction Proposal will be implemented due to the requirement to finalize and execute definitive transaction documentation with a number of third parties. Signature of such documentation is targeted

<<<

 in July/August 2015. The Transaction Proposal also remains subject to the approval of a two thirds majority of Bondholders attending a Bondholder meeting which is also expected in July/August 2015. Further details will be disclosed once definitive

<<<

 transaction documentation is finalized and the Company issues a summons for the Bondholder meeting.
A component of any Transaction Proposal is expected to be conversion of a proportion of the outstanding Bonds into common shares of the Company

<<<

 at a conversion price of not less than the current market price of Iona's common shares (subject to applicable TSX Venture Exchange policies). This will reduce leverage and is designed to create a sustainable ongoing capital structure for the

<<<

 Company. The Transaction Proposal, including conversion of outstanding Bonds to equity, is not expected to result in the creation of a new Control Person for the Company. As a result, it is not expected that the Transaction Proposal will require

<<<

 shareholder approval in accordance with TSX Venture Exchange Policy 4.3. All stakeholders are directed to the Forward Looking Statements section of this announcement.
Tom Reynolds, Chief Executive Officer, commented:
"Following an extensive

<<<

 Review we are pleased to have received support for the Transaction Proposal from a significant number of bondholders. We are focused on finalizing and

implementing the Transaction Proposal to support the development of the Orlando project

<<<

 and to create a sustainable long-term future for the Company."

 To date, the CATS onshore summer slowdown (scheduled for June and July 2015) has had a limited impact on Huntington production. o June 2015 (to June 25) production

<<<

(1) Iona also benefits from a 0.

<<<

75% differential lifting entitlement and a 1.8% royalty interest in the Huntington field.
The Huntington partners have now finalized commercial amendments to the Huntington gas transportation agreement which is expected to deliver an improvement

<<<

 in certainty of gas export volumes from Huntington for the remainder of the CATS summer maintenance slowdown period and on a longer term basis. The Orlando project continues to make progress. During a recent planned shutdown on the Ninian Central

<<<

Funding background

<<<



On September 27, 2013, Iona, via its UK subsidiary, Iona Energy Company (UK) pic, issued US$275 million in senior secured bonds (the "Bonds"). On March 27, 2015 the Company announced that bondholders had approved a series of amendments and

<<<

 waivers (the "Amendments") to increase financial flexibility for the Company.
The Company was in breach of the Bond covenants as at December 31, 2014 and would also have been in breach at March 31, 2015 had it not secured the Amendments from

<<<

 bondholders. Absent the Amendments, these consecutive quarterly breaches would have resulted in a default under the terms of the Bonds which could have required immediate repayment of the Bonds.
Under the terms of the Amendments, the Company

<<<

 was obliged to conduct a review before June 30 2015 (the "Review") to consider all options to enable (i) the funding of the Orlando project to achieve first oil by December 31,2016 and/or (ii) the refinancing of the Bonds.
