 Issuer has discussed making certain changes to the Bond Issue and to its FRN Siem Offshore Inc. Senior Unsecured Bond Issue 2014/2019 (the "2019 Bond Issue"). The Bond Issue and the 2019 Bond Issue are jointly referred to as the "Bond Issues

<<<

The Issuer will have the right to extend the existing USD 60,000,000 revolving credit facility agreement from Siem Industries Inc (the "RCF").
Siem Industries Inc will grant the Bondholders and the bondholders in the Bond Issues an option

<<<

 to acquire the right to repayment of the outstanding amount under the RCF at par value upon both the Bond Issues having been declared in default by the Bond Trustee (the "RCF Call Option").
The RCF will be renegotiated to extend its maturity

<<<

 date until after the new maturity date for the Bond Issue and to provide that any amount repaid under the RCF after the date of the Bondholders' meeting will be available to be re-borrowed, and that Siem Industries Inc will commit to have such

<<<

 funds available. Any PIK interest on the RCF will be a separate unsecured claim which may not be paid or enforced until after the Bonds have been repaid in full and which will be subordinated to the Bond Issues. Any PIK interest on the RCF

<<<

 will not be repaid until the maturity of the RCF. The Issuer has the right to pay cash interest on the RCF as long as cash interest is paid on the Bonds.

<<<

 the original maturity date.
Interest on the Bonds and the 2019 Bond Issue will be reduced by 0.75% p.a. from 30 April 2017 until the respective original maturity dates of each bond issue. Thereafter, the applicable margin will be the blended

<<<

 (arithmetic average) margin under these two bond issues less 0.75% p.a. The Issuer will be entitled to settle the margin by way of PIK for as long as interest on the RCF is also settled by way of PIK. For periods where the interest is settled

<<<

 by way of PIK the margin will increase by 0.75% p.a.
A USD tranche will be established under the Bond Issue subject to a minimum conversion of USD 20 million. Each Bondholder will get a one-time offer to convert his Bonds into Bonds on a separate

<<<

 ISIN for the new USD tranche. The USD tranche will have the same margin as the NOK tranche, but the reference rate will be 3 months LIBOR. Any such exchange offer will be made after the implementation of the Proposal described in this Summons

<<<

. The issuance of USD Bonds pursuant to such exchange offer will be carried out as a tap issue. No other tap issues will be permitted.
Certain new undertakings by the Issuer under the Bond Agreement:
· No dividends or distributions and no interest

<<<

 payments on shareholder loans except the RCF (where accrued interest will not be paid in cash unless corresponding cash interest payments are made under the Bonds and the 2018 Bond Issue)
· No debt in the Group other than permitted debt.
·

<<<

 No new liens or securities other than permitted liens.

· Value Adjusted Equity Ratio will be reduced from 30% to 20% and amended so as to include excess value of shares subsidiaries.
