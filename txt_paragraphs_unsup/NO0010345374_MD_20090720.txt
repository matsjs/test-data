 Bond Issue 2008/2013 bondholders W e attach B+H Ocean Carriers Ltd's 2008 Annual Report on Form-20-F, which includes audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the information of the bondholders, we wish to clarify

<<<

 one item in our audited financial statements that may be confusing. As set forth in our financial statements, the Company's auditor has required the Company to reclassify its long term debt as current due to US accounting rules. This reclassification

<<<

 arises in connection with one breach of a covenant under certain loan agreements at 31 Dec 2008. However, this breach was waived by the relevant .lenders, and there are no outstanding breaches. Despite the accounting reclassification of our

<<<

 long term debt as current, none of our long term debt has actually been accelerated by our lenders, and there are no outstanding events of default that would permit debt to be accelerated at this time,
Sincerely,
For B+H Ocean CarrierSj^tdT

B. Risk factors
You should consider carefully the following factors as well as other information set forth in this report. Some o f the following

<<<

 risks relate principally to the industry in which the Company operates and its business in general. Other risks relate principally to the securities market and ownership o f its stock. Any o f the risk factors could significantly and negatively

<<<

 affect its business, financial condition or operating results and the trading price o f its stock. You could lose all or part o f your investment.
Industry Specific Risk Factors
The cyclical nature of the international shipping industry m ay

<<<

 lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which may adversely affect its earnings
The shipping industry is generally known to be cyclical. V essel values and charter freight rates fluctuate w idely and frequently, and the

<<<

 Company expects they will continue to do so in the future. Growth within the largest economies will normally contribute to an increase in the lon-mile demand in global seaborne trade.
The downturns in the product tanker and bulk charter markets

<<<

 may have an adverse effect on shipping company earnings and affect compliance with loan covenants
Charter rates for product tankers and bulk carriers have declined sharply since the middle o f 2008. The decline in charter rates in the product

<<<

 tanker and bulk carrier markets has resulted in a commensurate decline in the industrywide vessel values, affecting cash flows, liquidity and compliance with the covenants contained in loan agreements for most shipping companies.
The operations

<<<

 o f the Company on a worldwide basis may increase the volatility of the Company's business
The operations o f the Company arc conducted primarily outside the United Slates and therefore may be affected by currency fluctuations and by changing

<<<

 economic, political and governmental conditions in the countries where its vessels operate and are registered. Future hostilities or other political instability in the regions in which the Company conducts its operations could affect the Company

<<<

's trade patterns and could adversely affect the Company's business and results o f operations. Although the substantial majority o f the Company's revenues and expenses have historically been denominated in United States dollars, there can

<<<

 be no assurance that the portion o f the Company's business conducted in other currencies will not increase in the future, which could expand the Company's exposure to losses arising from currency fluctuations.
The Company is subject to regulation

<<<

 and liability under environmental laws that could require significant expenditures and affect its cash flows and net income
The Company's operations are subject to extensive regulation in the form o f local, national and foreign laws, as well

<<<

 as international treaties and conventions that can subject us to material liabilities for environmental events.
The operation o f its vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the International Management Code for the Safe Operation

<<<

 o f Ships and Pollution Prevention (the "ISM Code"). The ISM Code requires ship owners and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive "Safety Management System" that includes the adoption o f a safety and environmental protection

<<<

 policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. The failure o f a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability

<<<

, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels, and may result in a denial o f access to, or detention in, certain ports. Currently, each o f the vessels in its fleet is ISM Code-certified.
The United States Oil Pollution

<<<

 Act o f 1990, ("OPA9Q"), provides that owners, operators and bareboat charterers arc strictly liable for the discharge o f oil in U.S. waters, including the 200 nautical mile zone o ff the U .S. coasts. OPA90 provides for unlimited liability

<<<

 in some circumstances, such as a vessel operator's gross negligence or willful misconduct. However, inm ost cases OPA90 limits liability to the greater o f $1,200 per gross ton or $10 m illion per vessel. OPA90 also permits states to set their

<<<

 own penalty limits. Most states bordering navigable waterways impose unlimited liability for discharges o f oil in their waters.
The International Maritime Organization, or IMO, has adopted a similar liability scheme that imposes strict liability

<<<

 for oil spills, subject to limits that do not apply if the release is caused by the vessel owner's intentional or reckless conduct.
The U .S. has established strict deadlines for phasing out single-hull and double-sided oil tankers, and both

<<<

 the IMO and the European Union have proposed similar phase-out periods. Under OPA90, oil tankers that do not have double hulls will be phased out by 2015 and will not be permitted to com e to United States ports or trade in United States waters

<<<

. One o f the Company's product tankers, representing approximately 8.5% b y deadweight ton ("DWT") o f its combined fleet, is a double-sided tanker and as such will be prohibited from carrying crude oil and oil products in U.S. waters or certain

<<<

 other countries by February 2010 unless an exemption is obtained from the vessel's flag state, in which case the prohibition would be deferred until February 2015. While the Company currently believes it will obtain such an exemption, it is

<<<

 possible that such an exemption will not be obtained.
In December 2003, the IMO adopted a proposed amendment to the International Convention for the Prevention o f Pollution from Ships to accelerate the phase out o f single-hull and non-qualifying

<<<

 double-sided tankers from 2015 to 2010 unless the relevant flag states extend the date to 2015. This amendment took effect in April 2005. The Company expects that its doublesided medium range ("MR") tanker and its double-sided Panamax product

<<<

 tanker will be unable to can y crude oil and petroleum products in many markets commencing between 2009 and 2010. Moreover, the IMO or other regulatory bodies may adopt further regulations in the future that could adversely affect the useful

<<<

 lives o f its tankers as well as the Company's ability to generate income from them. Also, new IMO regulation came into force as o f January 1, 2007 requiring vegetable oils to be carried on IMO type 2 chemical tankers. This regulation effectively

<<<

 excluded the Company's six MR ships from this trade. The Company decided to convert these ships to meet the new requirements for both IMO Annex II and also Annex I, which regulates petroleum products. Four o f the ships were converted in 2

<<<

006 and 2007, and one supramax tanker was converted to a bulk carrier in 2008. The Company then decided to sell one MR product tanker and to convert the remaining M R tankers to bulk carriers; one o f these MR tankers was sold in January 20

<<<

09 and the other MR tanker's conversion was completed in January 2009. The supramax tanker SACHEM was converted to a bulk carrier in M ay 2008. The Company may also convert a Panamax product tanker to a double-hull product tanker in 2010.
The

<<<

 Panama Canal Authority (PCA) recently issued an Advisory announcing that it may exercise its authority to deny the transit o f a single-hull oil tanker which has been granted a Flag State exemption from the phase-out provisions o f MARPOL 

<<<

(the International Convention for the Prevention o f Pollution from Ships). I f it does allow such transit, all additional costs or resources provided to minimize the risk o f environmental damage will be charged to the vessel. The PCA will

<<<

 evaluate each ship on a case-by-case basis.
These requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives o f the Company's vessels. As a result o f accidents such as the Novem ber 2002 oil spill relating to the loss o f the M/T Prestige,

<<<

 a 26-ycar old single-hull tanker, the Company believes that regulation o f the tanker industry will continue to become more stringent and more expensive for the Company and its competitors. Substantial violations o f applicable requirements

<<<

 or a catastrophic release from one o f the Company's vessels could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results o f operations as well as its reputation in the crude oil and refined petroleum products sectors, and could

<<<

 therefore negatively impact its ability to obtain charters in the future.
The Company's vessels are subject to inspection by a classification society
The hull and machinery o f every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society

<<<

 authorized by its country o f registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations o f the country o f registry o f the vessel and the Safety o f Life at

<<<

 Sea Convention. The Company's fleet is currently enrolled with the American Bureau o f Shipping, Bureau Veritas, D clNorske Veritas, Class NKK and Lloyds.
A vessel must undergo Annual Surveys, Intermediate Surveys and Special Surveys. In lieu

<<<

 o f a Special Survey, a v essel's machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. The Company's vessels are on Special Survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous

<<<

 survey cycles for machinery inspection. Every vessel is also required to be drydocked every two to three years for inspection o f the underwater parts o f such vessel.
I f any vessel docs not maintain its class or fails any Annual Survey, Intermediate

<<<

 Survey or Special Survey, the vessel will be unable to trade between ports and will be unemployable and the Company could be in violation o f certain covenants in its loan agreements. This would negatively impact its revenues.
Maritime claimants

<<<

 could arrest its vessels, which could interruptits cash flow
Crew members, suppliers o f goods and services to a vessel, shippers o f cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claim

<<<

 s or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment o f one or more o f its vessels could interrupt its cash flow and require the Company

<<<

 to pay large sums o f funds to have the arrest lifted.
In addition, in som e jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the "sister ship" theory o f liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant's maritime

<<<

 lien and any "associated" vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert "sister ship" liability agaiust one vessel in its fleet for claims relating to another o f its ships.

Governments could

<<<

 requisition the Company's vessels during a period o f war or emergency, resulting in loss o f earnings
A government could requisition for title or seize the Company's vessels. Requisition for title occurs w hen a government takes control o

<<<

 f a vessel and becomes the owner. Also, a government could requisition its vessels for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control o f a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally

<<<

, requisitions occur during a period o f war or emergency. Government requisition o f one or more o f its vessels may negatively impact its revenues.
The shipping business is subject to the effect o f world events
Terrorist attacks such as the

<<<

 attacks on the United States on September 11 ,2 0 0 1 , in London on July 7, 2005 and in Mumbai on November 26, 2008 and the continuing response o f the United States and others to these attacks, as w ell as the threat o f future terrorist

<<<

 attacks in the United States or elsewhere, continue to cause uncertainty in the world financial markets and may affect the Company's business, results o f operations and financial condition. The continuing presence o f the United States and

<<<

 other armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan may lead to additional acts o f terrorism and armed conflict around the world, which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets. These uncertainties could also adversely

<<<

 affect its ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining o f waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly

<<<

 in the Arabian G ulf region. Acts o f terrorism and piracy have also affected vessels trading in regions such as the South Chiua Sea. A ny o f these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, revenues and costs

<<<

.
Terrorist attacks, such as the attack on the vessel Limburg in October 2002, may in the future also negatively affect the Company's operations and financial condition and directly impact the Company's vessels or customers. Future terrorist

<<<

 attacks could result in increased volatility o f the financial markets in the United Slates and globally and could result in an economic recession in the United Slates or the world. Any o f these occurrences could have a material adverse impact

<<<

 ou its operating results, revenue and costs.
The general decline in the bulk and product carrier charter m arket has adversely affected our revenues, earnings and profitability
The Baltic Drybulk Index, or BDI, declined from a high o f 11,

<<<

793 in May 2008 to a low o f 663 in December 2008, which represents a decline o f 94%. The BDI fell over 70% during the month o f October alone. Over the comparable period o f May through December 2008, the high and low o f the Baltic Panamax

<<<

 Index and the Baltic Capcsizc Index represent a decline o f 96% and 99%, respectively. The Baltic Clean Tankers Index (BCTI), a measure o f international clean tanker routes and a selection o f basket and individual TCEs, dropped from 839 points

<<<

 before the end o f 2008 to 465 points as at June 30, 2009 According to industry sources, the average spot market rate for an M R product tanker transporting 38,000 tons o f gasoline reached a low o f $7,000 per day, on June 2009, compared to

<<<

 a high o f $20,000 reached during 2008. The decline in charter rales is due to various factors, including the unavailability o f trade financing and the worldwide recession. The decline in charter rates in the drybulk market also affects the

<<<

 value o f our vessels, which follow s the trends o f charter rates, and earnings on our charters, and similarly, affects our cash flows and liquidity.
Charter hire rates for bulk carriers and product tankers have decreased, which may adversely

<<<

 affect our earnings
The bulk shipping industry and product tanker sectors arc cyclical with attendant volatility in charter hire rates and profitability. For example, the degree o f charter hire rate volatility among different types o f bulk

<<<

 carriers and product tankers has varied widely. After reaching historical highs in mid-2008, charter hire rates for Panamax and Capesize bulk carriers reached near historically low levels in December 2008, began improving in January and February

<<<

 2009 and then deteriorated in the latter half o f March 2009. Because w e charter some o f our vessels pursuant to spot market voyage charters, or spot charters, w e arc exposed to changes in spot market charter rales for bulk carriers and

<<<

 such changes may affect our eaniings and the value o f our bulk carriers at any given time. W e m ay not be able to successfully charter our vessels in the future or renew existing charters at rates sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations

<<<

. Because the factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels arc outside o f our control and are unpredictable, the nature, liming, direction and degree o f changes in industry conditions are also unpredictable.
Factors that influence demand

<<<

 for vessel capacity include:
Supply and demand for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;
Changes in the exploration or production o f energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished

<<<

 consumer and industrial products;
The location o f regional and global exploration, production and manufacturing facilities;
The location o f consuming regions for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial

<<<

 products;
The globalization o f production and manufacturing;
Global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts and terrorist aclivitilies; embargoes and strikes;
Developments in international trade;
Changes in

<<<

 seaborne and other transportation patterns, including the distance cargo is transported by sea;
Environmental and other regulatory developments;
Currency exchange rates; and
Weather.
The factors that influence the supply o f vessel capacity

<<<

 include:
The number o f newbuilding deliveries;
Port and canal congestion;
The scrapping rate o f older vessels;
V essel casualties; and
The number o f vessels that are out o f service.
We anticipate that the future demand for our v essels

<<<

 will be dependent upon continued economic growth in the w orld's economics, including China and India, seasonal and regional changes in demand, changes in the capacity o f the global carrier fleet and the sources and supply o f cargoes to be

<<<

 transported by sea. The capacity o f the global carrier fleet seem s likely to increase and economic growth m ay not continue. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and

<<<

 operating results.
Disruptions in world financial markets and the resulting governmental action in the United States and in other parts o f the world could have a further material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition

 and cash flows, and could cause the market price o f our common stock to decline
The United Slates and other parts o f the world arc exhibiting deteriorating economic trends and have been in a recession. For example, the credit markets in the

<<<

 United Stales have experienced significant contraction, de-levcraging and reduced liquidity, and the United States federal government and stale governments have implemented and are considering a broad variety o f governmental action and/or

<<<

 new regulation o f the financial markets. Securities and futures markets and the credit markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and other requirements. The Securities and Exchange Commission, other regulators, self-regulatory

<<<

 organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event o f market emergencies, and may effect changes in law or interpretations o f existing laws.
Recently, a number o f financial institutions have experienced

<<<

 serious financial difficulties and, in som e cases, have entered bankruptcy proceedings or are in regulatory enforcement actions. The uncertainty surrounding the future o f the credit markets in the United Slates and the rest o f the world

<<<

 has resulted in reduced access to credit worldwide.
We face risks attendant to changes in economic environments, changes in interest rates, and instability in the banking and securities markets around the world, among other factors. Major market

<<<

 disruptions and the current adverse changes in market conditions and regulatory climate in the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our business or impair our ability

to borrow amounts under our credit facilities or any future

<<<

 financial arrangements. We cannot predict how long the current market conditions will last. However, these recent and developing economic and governmental factors, together with the concurrent decline in charter rates and vessel values, may

<<<

 have a material adverse effect on our results o f operations, financial condition or cash flows, have caused the price o f our common slock on the American Stock Exchange to decline and could cause the price o f our common slock to decline

A further economic slowdown in the Asia Pacific region could exacerbate the effect o f recent slowdowns in the economies o f the United States and the European Union and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business

, financial condition and results o f operations.
The Company anticipates a significant number o f the port calls made by its vessels will continue to involve the loading or discharging o f bulk commodities in ports in the Asia Pacific region

<<<

. As a result, further negative changes in economic conditions in any Asia Pacific country, particularly in China, may exacerbate the effect o f recent slowdowns in the economics o f the United Stales and the European Union and may have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results o f operations, as well as its future prospects. In recent years, China has been one o f the world's fastest growing economics in terms o f gross domestic product, which has had

<<<

 a significant impact on shipping demand. For the year ended December 3 1 ,2008, the growth o f China's gross domestic product from the prior year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 0 7 was approximately 9%, compared with a growth rate o f U.2% over the

<<<

 same two year period ended December 3 1 ,2007, and its growth in the fourth quarter o f 2008 fell to an annualized rate o f 6.8%. It is likely that China and other countries in the Asia Pacific region will continue to experience slowed or even

<<<

 negative economic growth in the near future. Moreover, the current economic slowdown in the economies o f the U nited States, the European Union and other Asian countries may further adversely affect economic growth in China and elsewhere.

<<<

 China has recently announced a $586.0 billion stimulus package aimed in part at increasing investment and consumer spending and maintaining export growth in response to the recent slowdown in its economic growth. The Company's business, financial

<<<

 condition and results o f operations, as well as our future prospects, w ill likely be materially and adversely affected by a further economic downturn in any o f these countries.
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have recently increased

<<<

 in frequency, which could adversely affect our business
Acts o f piracy have historically affected occan-goiug vessels trading in regions o f the world such as the South China Sea and in the G ulf o f Aden o ff the coast o f Somalia. Throughout

<<<

 2008, the frequency o f piracy incidents has increased significautly, particularly in the G ulf o f Aden o ff the coast o f Somalia. For example, in November 2008, the MV Sirius Slav, a tanker vessel not affiliated with us, was captured by

<<<

 pirates in the Indian Ocean w hile carrying crude oil estimated to be worth $100 million. I f these piracy attacks result in regions in which our vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as "war risk" zones, as the G ulf o f Aden

<<<

 temporarily was in M ay 2008, or Joint War Committee (JWC) "war and strikes" listed areas, premiumspayable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. Crew costs, including those

<<<

 due to employing onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. In addition, while w c believe the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold

<<<

 charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not "on-hire" for a certain number o f days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim that w e would dispute.

<<<

 W e may uot be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, detention hijacking as a result o f an act o f piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability

<<<

 o f insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cash flows.
Rising fuel prices may adversely affect our profits
W hile w c do not bear the cost o f fuel (bunkers

<<<

) under our lim e and bareboat charters, fuel is a significant, i f not the largest, expense in our shipping operations when vessels arc under spot charter. Changes in the price o f fuel m ay adversely affect our profitability. The price and

<<<

 supply o f fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war aud unrest in oil producing countries

<<<

 and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Further, fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which may reduce the profitability and competitiveness o f our business versus other forms o f transportation

<<<

, such as truck or rail.
Company Specific Risk Factors
The Company's business is dependent on the m arkets for product tankers and OBOs, which can be cyclical
The Company's fleet consists o f product tankers, bulk carriers and ore/bulk/oil combination

<<<

 carriers ("OBOs"). Thus, the Company is dependent upon the petroleum product industry, the vegetable oil and chemical industries and the dry bulk industry as its primary sources o f revenue. These industries have historically been subject to

<<<

 substantial fluctuation as a result of, among other things, economic conditions in general and demand for petroleum products, steel and iron ore, coal, vegetable oil and chemicals, in particular. Any material seasonal fluctuation in the industry

<<<

 or any material diminution in the level o f activity therein could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operating results. The profitability o f these v essels and their asset value results from changes in the supply

<<<

 o f and demand for such capacity. The factors affecting such supply and demand are described in more detail under "Industry Specific Risk Factors" above.
Tbe Company is in technical default o f a financial covenant contained in certain loan

<<<

 agreements as o f December 31,2008, and is currently in discussions with certain lenders for waiver of such technical default and potential additional defaults on other covenants

Loan agreements require that the Company comply with certain

<<<

 financial and other covenants. Due to weak market conditions the Company has been unable to comply with a particular covenant in Tour loan agreements which require that Total Value Adjusted Equity should represent not less than 30% o f Total

<<<

 Value Adjusted Assets. A t December 31, 2008, the actual ratio was 28.5% or 1.5% below the minimum requirement. Although the banks concerned have advised the Company by e-mail in each case that a waiver has been approved, which the Company

<<<

 believes on advice o f counsel is binding, the Company is seeking to confirm the waivers in definitive written agreements. The Company docs not expect that it will be able to meet all prospective financial covenants o f these four loan agreements

<<<

, especially if current market conditions continue. Accordingly, the Company is in negotiations with its lenders to obtain waivers o f future potential technical breaches o f covenants and restructure the loans. Until and unless these potential

<<<

 technical defaults are waived, the lenders have the right to cancel the commitment and demand repayment. Therefore, the Company has reclassified the following four loan agreement as current:
1) $202 million reducing revolving credit facility

<<<

 with Nordea Bank Norge ASA, orNordcaBank, as Agent, dated August 29, 2006 (amount reclassified o f $57.2 million). The agreement requires that any modification to the financial covenants requires approval by the majority o f lenders or 66.

<<<

67%. The Company requested that the Value Adjusted Equity ratio be reduced from the required 30% to 20% effective December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 through January 1 ,2 010, in the form o f a waiver. The Company has been informed by the Agent that banks

<<<

 representing greater than 66.67% o f the lenders have approved the waiver. Confirmation o f the final waiver is expected in the near term.
2) $30 million term loan facility with DVB Group Merchant Bank, DVB as agent, dated May 13, 2008 (amount

<<<

 re-classified o f $9.5 million). The Company has been informed by DVB Merchant Bank that it has approved the waiver to reduce the Value Adjusted Equity ratio from the required 30% to 20% effective December 31, 2008 through January 1, 2010.

<<<

 Confirmation o f the final waiver is expected in the near term.
3) $26.7 million term loan facility with Nordea Bank Norge ASA, dated October 25, 2007 (amount re-classified o f $9.6 million). The Company has been informed by Nordea Bank that

<<<

 it has approved the waiver to reduce the Value Adjusted Equity ratio from the required 30% to 20% effective December 31 ,2 0 0 8 through January 1, 2010. Confirmation o f the final waiver is expected in the near term.
4 ) $8 million term loan

<<<

 facility with Nordea Bank Norge ASA, dated September 5, 2006 (amount re-classified $1.5 million). The Company has been informed by Nordea Bank that it has approved the waiver to reduce the Value Adjusted Equity ratio from the required 30% to

<<<

 20% effective December 3 1,2 0 0 8 through January 1 ,2 010. Confirmation o f the final waiver is expected in the near term.
In addition, these potential technical defaults might trigger certain cross-default provisions or potential defaults

<<<

 under material adverse change covenants within the remaining loan documents. As a result the Company reclassified its remaining long term debt o f $48.9 m illion as current at December 31, 2008. This additional reclassification applies to three

<<<

 debt agreements as follows:
1) $34,000,000 term loan facility with Bank o f Scotland dated December 7,2007 (amount reclassified o f $16.6 million);
2) $27,300,000 term loan facility with Bank o f Nova Scotia dated January 24,2007 (amount reclassified

<<<

 o f $ l 6.8 million); and
3) $25,000,000 Unsecured Bonds with Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, as Loan Trustee, dated December 12, 2006 (amount reclassified o f$15.5 million).
A violation o f the Company's financial covenants may constitute an event

<<<

 o f default under its credit facilities, which would, unless waived by its lenders, provide its lenders with the right to require the Company to refrain from declaring and paying dividends and borrowing additional funds under the credit facility

<<<

, post additional collateral, enhance its equity and liquidity, increase its interest payments, pay down its indebtedness to a level where it are in compliance with its loan covenants, sell vessels in its fleet, reclassify its indebtedness as

<<<

 current liabilities and accelerate Us indebtedness and foreclose their liens on its vessels, which would impair the Company's ability to continue to conduct its business. A total o f $ 175.8 million o f indebtedness has been reclassified as

<<<

 current liabilities in the Company's audited consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2008, included in this report.
I f current market conditions continue, the Company docs not expect that it w ill be able to m eet all financial

<<<

 covenants o f Us credit facilities in the foreseeable future in the absence o f further agreement with its lenders. The Company is currently in discussions with its lenders to restructure its facilities including amendments to certain financial

<<<

 covenants, although the Company caimot assure you that it w ill be successful reaching an agreement with its lenders. In addition, in connection with any waiver or amendment to the Company's credit facilities, its lenders may impose additional

<<<

 operating and financial restrictions on it or modify the terms o f its credit facility. These restrictions may limit the Company's ability to, among other things, pay dividends in the future, make capital expenditures or incur additional indebtedness

<<<

, including through the issuance o f guarantees. In addition, its lenders may require the payment o f additional fees, require prepayment o f a portion o f its indebtedness to them, accelerate the amortization schedule for Us indebtedness and

<<<

 increase the interest rales they charge it on its outstanding indebtedness. If the Company's indebtedness is accelerated, it would be very difficult in the current financing environment for the Company to refinance its debt or obtain additional

<<<

 financing and it could lose its vessels if Us lenders foreclose their Ileus.
Double sided vessels arc being phased out
One o f the Company's product tankers, or approximately 8.5% by DW T o f its combined fleet, is a double-sided vessel. Under

<<<

 the United Stales Oil Pollution Act o f 1990, all oil tankers that do not have double hulls w ill be phased out over a 20-year period (1995-2015) based ou size, age and place o f discharge, unless retrofitted with double-hulls, and w ill not

<<<

 be permitted to come to United States ports or trade in U nited States waters. The European Union has required the phase out o f single hull vessels carrying "heavy oil" and as a result single hull v essels are prohibited from carrying this

<<<

 product to European Union ports. In addition, due to regulations adopted by the IMO under Aimex I (oil) o f MARPOL, single hull and double-sided vessels carrying petroleum products tankers w ill be phased out over the course o f the period

<<<

 between 2005 and 2010 unless, in the case o f double-sided vessels an exemption is obtain from the flag state. As a result o f the MARPOL regulations, the Company expects that its remaining Panamax product tanker will be unable to cany crude

<<<

 oil and petroleum products in many markets after 2010 unless it obtains an exemption. The Company currently expects that it will obtain such an exemption, which will permit the vessel to trade until February 2015. W hile the Company currently

<<<

 believes that it will obtain such an exemption, it is possible that it will not.
The Company's fleet consists o f second-hand vessels
AH o f the vessels comprising the Company's fleet were acquired second-hand. The Company intends to purchase

<<<

 additional second-hand vessels. In general, expenditures necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age o f the vessel increases. Moreover, second-hand vessels typically carry very limited warranties with

<<<

 respect to their condition as compared to warranties available for newer vessels. Because o f improvements in engine technology, older vessels are typically less fuel efficient than newer vessels. Changes in governmental regulations, safety

<<<

 or other equipment standards may require expenditures for alterations to existing equipment or the addition o f new equipment to the vessels and restrict the cargoes that the vessels may transport. There can be no assurance that market conditions

<<<

 wifi justify such expenditures or enable the Company to generate sufficient income or cash flow to allow it to meet its debt obligations.
If the Company acquires additional vessels and those vessels are not delivered on time or are delivered

<<<

 with significant defects, the Company's earnings aod financial condition could suffer.
The Company expects to acquire additional vessels in the future. A delay in the delivery o f any o f these vessels to the Company or the failure o f the

<<<

 contract counterparty to deliver a vessel at all could cause it to breach its obligations under a related time charter and could adversely affect its earnings, its financial condition and the amount o f dividends, if any, that it pays in the

<<<

 future. The delivery o f these vessels could be delayed or certain events m ay arise which could result in the Company not taking delivery o f a vessel, such as a total loss o f a vessel, a constructive loss o f a vessel, or substantial damage

<<<

 to a vessel prior to delivery. In addition, the delivery o f any o f these v essels with substantial defects could have similar consequcuces.
The Company is subject to financial risks related to the purchase o f additional vessels
The Company

<<<

's current business strategy includes the acquisition o f newer, high-quality second-hand vessels. Such vessels may be purchased at relatively high vessel prices. I f charter rates remain low or fall in the future, the Company may not be able

<<<

 to recover its investment in the new ships or even satisfy its payment obligations on its debt facilities that will be increased to finance the purchase o f such new vessels. There can also be no assurance that such acquisitions will be available

<<<

 on terms favorable to the Company or, that, if acquired, such second-hand vessels will have sufficient useful lives or carry adequate warranties or that financing for such acquisitions will be available.
The Company may be subject to loss and

<<<

 liability for which it may not be fully insured
The operation o f any ocean-going vessel carries an inherent risk, without regard to fault, o f catastrophic marine disaster, mechanical failure, collision and property losses to the vessel. Also

<<<

, the business o f the Company is affected by the risk o f environmental accidents, the risk o f cargo loss or damage, the risk o f business interruption because o f political action in foreign countries, labor strikes and adverse weather conditions

<<<

, all o f which could result in loss o f revenues, increased costs or loss o f reputation.
The Company maintains, aud intends to continue to maintain, insurance consistent with industry standards against these risks. The Company procures hull

<<<

 and machinery insurance,

protcctic-n and indemnity insurance, which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage and war risk insurance for its fleet. The Company docs not maintain insurance against loss o f hire for its

<<<

 product tankers and for one o f its bulk carriers, which covers business interruptions that result in the loss o f use o f a vessel. There can be no assurance that all risks will be adequately insured against, that any particular claim will

<<<

 be paid out o f such insurance or that the Company will be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future. More stringent environmental and other regulations may result in increased costs for, or

<<<

 the lack o f availability of, insurance against the risks o f environmental damage, pollution, damages asserted against the Company or the loss o f income resulting from a vessel being removed from operations. The Company's insurance policies

<<<

 contain deductibles for which the Company will be responsible and limitations and exclusions which may increase its costs or lower its revenue.
The Company places a portion o f its Hull and Machinery Insurance with Northampton Assurance Ltd

<<<

 ("NAL"), the great majority o f which N A L reinsures with market underwriters. NA L is a subsidiary o f Northampton Holdings Ltd., a major stockholder. Although the reinsurers are investment grade insurance companies, it is possible that they

<<<

 might default in the settlement o f a claim. Although the Company believes that NA L is adequately capitalized, in the event the reinsurers default, NAL, as primary insurer, may be unable in turn to settle the Company's claim.
Moreover, even

<<<

 if insurance proceeds are paid to the Company to cover the financial losses incurred following the occurrence o f one o f these events, there can be no assurance that the Company's business reputation, and therefore its ability to obtain future

<<<

 charters, will not be materially adversely affected by such event. Such an impact on the Company's business reputation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results o f operations. The Company may not be able to

<<<

 obtain adequate insurance coverage for its fleet in the future aud the insurers m ay not pay particular claims.
Risks involved with operating ocean-going vessels could affect tlic Company's business and reputation, which would adversely affect

<<<

 its revenues and stock price
The operation o f an ocean-going vessel carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility of:
· marine disaster; · piracy; · environmental accidents; · cargo and property losses or damage; and · business

<<<

 interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions.
Any o f these circumstances or events could increase the Company's costs or lower its

<<<

 revenues. The involvement o f its vessels in an oil spill or other environmental disaster may harm its reputation as a safe and reliable vessel operator and lead to a loss o f customers and revenue.
The Company may suffer adverse consequences

<<<

 from the fluctuation in the m arket value o f Its vessels
The fair market value o f its vessels may increase and decrease significantly depending on a number o f factors including:
· supply and demand for products, including crude oil, petroleum

<<<

 products, vegetable oil, ores, coal and grain; · general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry; · competition from other shipping companies; · types and sizes o f vessels; · other modes o f transportation; · cost o

<<<

 f building new vessels; · governmental or other regulations; · prevailing level o f charter rates; and · the cost o f retrofitting or m odifying second hand vessels as a result o f charterer requirements, technological advances in vessel design

<<<

 or equipment, or otherwise.
I f the Company sells vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen, the sale may be at less than the v essel's carrying amount on its financial statements, resulting in a loss and a reduction in earnings.
In

<<<

 addition, the Company's mortgage indebtedness at December 31, 2008 o f $175.8 million is secured by mortgages on the existing fleet o f vessels o f the Companyand its subsidiaries. A s a result o f the general decline in the market value o

<<<

 f vessels and consequently o f its fleet, the Company was not in compliance with certain provisions o f its existing credit facilities at December 3 1, 2008, and the Company may not be able to refinance its debt or obtain additional financing

<<<

. If the Company is unable to pledge additional collateral, its lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on its fleet.
The Company's vessels may suffer damage and the Company may face unexpected drydocking costs, which could affect its

<<<

 cash flow and financial condition
If the Company's vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility. The costs o f drydock repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. The Company may have to pay drydocking

<<<

 costs that its insurance docs not cover. The loss o f earnings while these vessels are being repaired aud repositioned, as well as the actual cost o f these repairs, would decrease its earnings. In addition, space at drydocking facilities is

<<<

 sometimes limited and not all drydocking facilities are conveniently located. The Company may be unable to find space a la suitable drydocking facility or our vessels m aybe forced to travel to a drydocking facility that is not conveniently

<<<

 located to our vessels' positions. The loss o f earnings w hile these vessels are forced to w ait for space or to steam to more distant drydocking facilities would decrease our earnings.
Purchasing and operating previously owned, or secondhand

<<<

, vessels may result in increased operating costs and vessels off-birc, which could adversely affect its earnings
The Company's inspection o f secondhand vessels prior to purchase does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition

<<<

 and cost o f required (or anticipated) repairs that the Company would have had i f these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Generally, the Company does not receive the benefit o f warranties on secondhand vessels.
In

<<<

 general, the costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition increase with the age o f the vessel. As o f December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 , the average age o f the vessels in its fleet was 19.9 years. Older vessels are typically less fuel efficient

<<<

 and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age o f a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers.
Governmental regulations

<<<

, safety or other equipment standards related to the age o f vessels may require expenditures for alterations or the addition o f new equipment, to its vessels and may restrict the type o f activities in which the vessels may engage. The Company

<<<

 cannot assure that, as its vessels age, market conditions will justify those expenditures or enable us to operate its vessels profitably during the remainder o f their useful lives. I f the Company sell vessels, the Company is not certain that

<<<

 the price for which the Company sells them will equal at least their carrying amount at that time.
The market for product tanker and OBO charters is highly competitive
The ownership o f the world's product tanker fleet is fragmented. Competition

<<<

 in the industry among vessels approved by major oil companies is primarily based on price, but also vessel specification and age. There are approximately 1,100 crude oil and product tankers o f between 25,000 and 50,000 DWT worldwide. Product

<<<

 Tankers arc typically operated in groups or pools consisting o f 10 to 25 vessels.
The OBO industry is also fragmented and competition is also primarily based on price, but also vessel specification and age. There are approximately 76 OBOs

<<<

 worldwide o f between 50,000 and 100,000 DWT. In this size range, the largest ownership group has nine vessels. Otherwise vessels are owned in groups o f six vessels or less.
The Company competes principally with other vessel owners through

<<<

 the global tanker and dry bulk charter market, which is comprised o f shipbrokers representing both charterers and ship owners. Charter parties are quoted on either an open or private basis. Requests for quotations ou an open charter are usually

<<<

 made by major oil companies on a general basis to a large number o f vessel operators. Competition for open charters can be intense and involves vessels owned by operators such as other major oil companies, oil traders and independent ship

<<<

 owners. Requests for quotations on a private basis arc made to a limited number o f vessel operators and are greatly influenced by prior customer relationships. The Company bids for both open and private charters.
Competition generally intensifies

<<<

 during times o f low market activity when several vessels may bid to transport the same cargo. Many o f the Company's competitors have greater financial strength and capital resources, as well as younger vessels.
The Company may be dependent

<<<

 on the spot market for charters

The Company's vessels are operated on a m ix o f time charters and spot market voyages. The spot charter market is highly competitive and spot charter rates arc subject to greater fluctuation than lime charter

<<<

 rates. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in keeping its vessels fully employed in the spot market or that future spot charter rates will be sufficient to enable the Company's v essels to be operated profitably.
The

<<<

 Company is dependent upon certain significant customers
At December 31, 2008, the Company's largest five accounts receivable balances represented 92% o f total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2007, the Company's largest five accounts receivable

<<<

 balances represented 86% o f total accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $253,000 and $336,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. To date, the Company's actual losses on past due receivables have

<<<

 not exceeded our estimate o f bad debts.
The Company will depend entirely on B+H Management Ltd. ("BHM") to m anage and charter its fleet
The Company subcontracts the commercial and most o f the technical management o f its fleet, including

<<<

 crewing, maintenance and repair to BHM, an affiliated company with which the Company is under common control. The loss o f BHM's services or its failure to perform its obligations to the Company could materially and adversely affect the results

<<<

 o f its operations. Although the Company may have rights against BHM if it defaults on its obligations to the Company, shareholders will have no recourse against BHM . Further, the Company expects that it will need to seek approval from lenders

<<<

 to change its manager.
BHM is a privately held company and there is little or no publicly available information about it
The ability o f BHM to continue providing services for its benefit w ill depend in pari on its own financial strength.

<<<

 Circumstances beyond its control could impair BHM 's financial strength, and because it is privately held it is unlikely that information about its financial strength would become public unless BHM began to default on its obligations. As a

<<<

 result, an investor in the Company's shares might have little advance warning o f problems affecting BHM, even though these problems could have a material adverse effect on us.
The Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has affiliations

<<<

 with BHM which could create conflicts o f interest
The Company's majority shareholders, which are affiliated with Mr. Michael S. Huducr, own 66.7% o f the Company and also own BHM. Mr. Hudner is also BHM 's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

<<<

. These responsibilities and relationships could create conflicts o f interest between us, on the one hand, and BHM, on the other hand. These conflicts may arise in connection with the chartering, purchase, sale and operations o f the vessels

<<<

 in its fleet versus vessels managed by other companies affiliated with BHM and Mr. Hudner. In particular, BHM may give preferential treatment to vessels that are beneficially owned by related parties because Mr. Hudner and members o f his family

<<<

 may receive greater economic benefits.
If the Company fails to manage its planned growth properly, the Company may not be able to successfully expand its market share
The Company m ay substantially increase the size o f its fleet via acquisitions

<<<

. This may impose additional responsibilities on its management and staff, and the management and staff o f BHM. This may necessitate that the Company and BHM increase the number o f personnel. BHM may have to increase its customer base to provide

<<<

 continued employment for the vessels to be acquired.
The Company's growth w ill depend on:
· locating and acquiring suitable vessels; · identifying and consummating acquisitions or joint ventures; · integrating any acquired business successfully

<<<

 with its existing operations; · enhancing its customer base; · managing its expansion; and · obtaining required financing.
Growing any business by acquisition presents numerous risks such as undisclosed liabilities and obligations, difficulty

<<<

 experienced in obtaining additional qualified personnel and managing relationships with customers and suppliers and integrating new ly acquired operations into existing infrastructures. The Company cannot give any assurance that the Company

<<<

 will be successful in executing its growth plans or that the Company will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection therewith.
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to pay dividends
The Company has a policy o f investment

<<<

 for future growth and docs not anticipate paying cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. Declaration and payment o f any dividend is subject to the discretion o f its Board o f Directors. The timing and amount o f dividend

<<<

 payments will be dependent upon its earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, fleet renewal and expansion, restrictions in its loan agreements, the provisions o f Liberia law affecting the payment o f distributions

<<<

 to shareholders and other factors. If there is a substantial decline in the product market or bulk charter market, its earnings would be negatively affected thus limiting its ability to pay dividends. Liberia law generally prohibits the payment

<<<

 o f dividends other lhau from surplus or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent upon the payment o f such dividend. The current floating rate facilities restrict the Company from paying dividends.
Senicing future debt would

<<<

 limit funds available for other purposes such as the payment o f dividends
To finance its future fleet expansion program, the Company expects to incur secured debt. The Company w ill need to dedicate a portion o f its cash flow from operations

<<<

 to pay the principal and interest on its debt. These payments limit funds otherwise available for working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes. The need to service its debt may limit funds available for other purposes, including

<<<

 distributing cash to its shareholders, and its inability to service debt could lead to acceleration o f its debt and foreclosure on its fleet.
The Company's loan agreements contain restrictive covenants that may limit the Company's liquidity

<<<

 and corporate activities
The Company's loan agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may limit its ability to:
· mcuradditional indebtedness; · create liens oil its assets; · sell capital stock o f its

<<<

 subsidiaries; · engage in mergers or acquisitions; · make capital expenditures; · change the management o f its vessels or terminate or materially amend the management agreement relating to each vessel; and  sell its vessels.
Therefore, the

<<<

 Company may need to seek permission from its lender in order to engage in som e corporate actions. The Company's lender's interests may be different from ours, and the Company cannot guarantee that the Company w ill be able to obtain its lender

<<<

's permission when needed. This may prevent us from taking actions that are in its best interest.
The Company is a holding company, and the Company depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy its

<<<

 financial obligations or to make dividend payments
The Company is a holding company and its subsidiaries, which arc all wholly-owned by us, conduct all o f their operations and own all o f their operating assets. The Company has no significant

<<<

 assets other than the equity interests in its wholly-ow ned subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to make dividend payments depends on its subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to as. I f the Company is unable to obtain funds

<<<

 from its subsidiaries, its Board o f Directors may exercise its discretion not to pay dividends.
The Company may not generate sufficient gross revenue to operate profitably or to service its indebtedness
The Company had net income o f $15.

<<<

9 million on gross revenue o f $104.0 million in 2008. Income from vessel operations was $4.6 million for the year-end December 31, 2008. At December 3 1 ,2008, the Company had approximately $175.8 m illion in indebtedness. There can be no assurance

<<<

 that future charter rates will be sufficient to generate adequate revenues or that the Company will be able to maintain efficiency levels to permit the Company to operate profitably or to service its indebtedness.
The Company's charterers m

<<<

 ay terminate or default on their charters, which could adversely affect results o f operations and cash flow

The terms o f the Company's charters vary as to which events or occurrences w ill cause a charter to terminate or give the charterer

<<<

 the option to terminate the charter, but these generally include a total or constructive total loss o f the related vessel, the requisition for hire o f the related vessel or the failure o f the related vessel to meet specified performance

<<<

 criteria. In addition, the ability o f each o f its charterers to perform its obligations under a charter will depend on a number o f factors that are beyond its control. These factors may include general economic conditions, the condition

<<<

 o f a specific shipping market sector, the charter rates received for specific types o f vessels and various operating expenses. The costs and delays associated with the default by a charterer o f a vessel may be considerable and may adversely

<<<

 affect the Company's business, results o f operations, cash flow s and financial condition.
The Company cannot predict whether our charterers will, upon the expiration o f their charters, recharler its vessels on favorable terms or at all.

<<<

 If the Company's charterers decide not to recharter its vessels, the Company m ay not be able to recharler them on terms similar to the terms o f current charters.
I f the Company receives lower charter rales under replacement charters or are

<<<

 unable to recharter all o f the Company's vessels, the Company's business, results o f operations, cash flows and financial condition m aybe adversely affected.
In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company's charterers may no longer

<<<

 need a vessel that is currently under charter or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rales. As a result, charterers may seek to renegotiate the terms o f their existing charter parties or avoid their obligations under those contracts

<<<

. Should counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with the Company, the Company could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results o f operations, cash Hows and financial

<<<

 condition.
The creditworthiness and performance o f its time charterers may affect its financial condition and its ability to obtain additional debt financing and pay dividends
The Company's income is derived from the charter o f its vessels

<<<

. Any defaults by any o f its charterers could adversely impact its financial condition, including its ability to service its debt and pay dividends. In addition, the actual or perceived credit quality o f its charterers, and any defaults by

<<<

 them, may materially affect its ability to obtain the additional capital resources that the Company will require purchasing additional vessels or may significantly increase its costs o f obtaining such capital. The Company's inability to obtain

<<<

 additional financing at all or at a higher than anticipated cost may materially affect its results o f operation and Its ability to implement its business strategy.
As the Company expands its business, the Company will need to improve its operations

<<<

 and financial systems, staff and crew; if the Company cannot improve these systems or recruit suitable employees, its performance may be adversely affected
The Company's current operating and financial system s may not be adequate as the Company

<<<

 implements its plan to expand the size o f its fleet, and its attempts to improve those systems may be ineffective. In addition, as the Company expands its fleet, the Company will have to rely on BHM to recruit suitable additional seafarers

<<<

 and shoresidc administrative and management personnel. The Company cannot assure you that BHM will be able to continue to hire suitable employees as the Company expands its fleet. If BHM 's unaffiliated crewing agent encounters business or

<<<

 financial difficulties, the Company may not be able to adequately staff its vessels. I f the Company is unable to operate its financial and operations systems effectively or to recruit suitable employees as the Company expand its fleet, its

<<<

 performance may be adversely affected.
In the highly competitive international shipping industry, the Company may not be able to compete for charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources
The Company employs its

<<<

 v essels in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive aud highly fragmented. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners some o f whom have substantially greater resources than the Company does. Competition for the transportation

<<<

 o f dry bulk and liquid cargo can be intense and depends on price, location, size, age, condition and the acceptability o f the vessel and its managers to the charterers. Due in part to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater

<<<

 resources could enter and operate larger fleets through consolidations or acquisitions that may be able to offer belter prices and fleets.
The Company may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other employees in the shipping

<<<

 industry, which may negatively affect the effectiveness o f its management and its results o f operations
The Company's success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts o f its management team. The Company has no employment

<<<

 contract with its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael S. Hudncr, or any other key individual; instead all management services are provided by BHM. The Company's success will depend upon BH M 's ability to hire and retain key members

<<<

 o f its management team. The loss o f any o f these individuals could adversely affect its business prospects aud financial condition. Difficulty in hiring and retaining personnel could adversely affect its results o f operations.
The Company

<<<

 is subject to the reporting requirements of Sarbanes-Oxlcy
Effective for its first fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2009, the Company is subject to full compliance with all provisions o f the Sarbanes-Oxley Act o f 2002. As directed

<<<

 by Section 404 o f the Sarbanes-Oxley Act o f 2002 ("Section 404"), the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report o f management on the Company's internal control over financial reporting

<<<

 in their annual reports on Form 20-F. Such a report is required to contain an assessment by management o f the effectiveness o f a company's internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, the independent registered public accounting

<<<

 firm auditing a public company's financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness o f the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. While the Company would expend significant resources in developing the necessary

<<<

 documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404, there is a risk that the Company would not comply with all o f the requirements imposed by Section 404. I f the Company can not maintain the required controls, the Company may be

<<<

 unable to comply with the requirements o f Section 404 in a timely maimer. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss o f confidence in the reliability o f its financial statements, which could cause the

<<<

 market price o f its common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance its operations.
The Company may have to pay tax on United States source income, which would reduce its earnings
Under the United States Internal Revenue

<<<

 Code o f 1986, or the Code, 50% o f the gross shipping income o f a vessel-owning or chartering corporation, such as the Company and its subsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that docs not begin and end

<<<

, in the United States is characterized as United States source shipping income and as such is subject to a four percent United States federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax

<<<

 under Section 883 o f the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder in August 2003. Such Treasury Regulations became effective on January 1, 2005, for calendar year taxpayers such as the Company and Us subsidiaries.
The Company

<<<

 expects that it will qualify for this statutory tax exemption and the Company will lake this position for United States federal income tax return reporting purposes. I f the Company is not entitled to this exemption under Section 883 for any

<<<

 taxable year, it would be subject for those years to a 4% United States federal income tax on its U .S. source shipping income. The imposition o f this taxation could have a negative effect on its business and would result in decreased earnings

<<<

 available for distribution to its shareholders.
U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a "passive foreign investment company," which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders
A foreign corporation will be treated

<<<

 as a "passive foreign investment company," or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if cither (1) at least 75% o f its gross income for any taxable year consists o f certain types o f "passive incom e" or (2) at least 50% o f the average

<<<

 value o f the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production o f those types o f "passive income". For purposes o f these tests, "passive income" includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange o f investment

<<<

 properly and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parlies in connection with the active conduct o f a trade or business. For purposes o f these tests, income derived from the performance o f services

<<<

 does not constitute "passive income". U.S. shareholders o f a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U .S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, i

<<<

 f any, they derive from the sale or other disposition o f their shares in the PFIC.
Based on its proposed method o f operation, the Company does not believe that the Company w ill be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. In this regard,

<<<

 the Company intends to treat the gross income the Company derives or is deemed to derive from its time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, the Company believes that its income from time chartering

<<<

 activities docs not constitute "passive income", and the assets that the Company owns and operates in connection with the production o f that income do not constitute passive assets.
There is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC

<<<

 rules addressing its proposed method o f operation. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the U .S, Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or a court o f Jaw wilJ accept its position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court o f law could

<<<

 determine that the Company is a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that the Company would not constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent o f its operations.
I f the IRS were to

<<<

 find that the Company is or has been a PFIC for any taxable year, its U.S. shareholders will face adverse U.S. tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make an election available under the Code (which election could

<<<

 itself have adverse consequences for such shareholders, as discussed, above such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax at the theu prevailing income lax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions

<<<

 and upon any gain from the disposition o f its common shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder's holding period o f its common shares.
The Company may not he exempt from Liberian taxation

<<<

, which would materially reduce its net income and cash flow by the amount o f the applicable tax
The Republic o f Liberia enacted a new income tax law generally effective as o f January I, 200 J (the "New Act"), which repealed, in its entirety

<<<

, the prior income tax law in effect since

1977 pursuant to which the Company and its Liberian subsidiaries, as non-resident domestic corporations, were wholly exempt from Liberian (ax.
In 2004, the Liberian Ministry o f Finance issued regulations

<<<

 pursuant to which a non-rcsidcnt domestic corporation engaged in international shipping such as ourselves w ill not be subject to tax under the N ew Act retroactive to January 1, 2001 (the "New Regulations"). In addition, the Liberian Ministry

<<<

 o fJustice issued an opinion that the N ew Regulations were a valid exercise o f the regulatory authority o f the Ministry o f Finance. Therefore, assuming that the N ew Regulations arc valid, the Company and its Liberian subsidiaries will

<<<

 be w holly exempt from tax as under Prior Law.
I f the Company were subject to Liberian income tax under the N ew Act, the Company and its Liberian subsidiaries would be subject to lax at a rate o f 35% on its worldwide income. As a result

<<<

, its net income and cash flow would be materially reduced by the amount o f the applicable tax. In addition, shareholders would be subject to Liberian withholding tax on dividends at rates ranging from 15% to 20%.
The Company is incorporated

<<<

 in the Republic o f the Liberia, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate law
The Company's corporate affairs are governed by its Articles o f Incorporation and By-laws and by the Liberia Business Corporations Act, or BCA. The

<<<

 provisions o f the BCA resemble provisions o f the corporation laws o f a number o f states in the United Slates. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Republic o f the Liberia interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities

<<<

 o f directors under the law o f the Republic o f the Liberia are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities o f directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain United States jurisdictions

<<<

. Shareholder rights may differ as w ell. While the BCA docs specifically incorporate the non-stalutory law, or judicial case law, o f the State o f Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, its public shareholders

<<<

 m ay have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face o f actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders o f a corporation incorporated in a United States jurisdiction.
Because m ost o

<<<

 f its employees are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements, failure o f industry groups to renew those agreements may disrupt its operations and adversely affect its earnings
All o f the seafarers on the ships in its licet

<<<

 arc covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements that set basic standards. The Company cannot assure you that these agreements will prevent labor interruptions. Any labor interruptions could disrupt its operations and harm its

 financial performance.
Item 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY
A. History and development of the Company
B+H Ocean Carriers Ltd. (the "Company"*) was organized on April 2 8 ,1 9 8 8 to engage in the business o f acquiring, investing in, owning,

<<<

 operating and selling vessels for dry bulk and liquid cargo transportation. As o f December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 , the Company owned and operated four MR product tankers, one Panamax product tanker, two bulk carriers and five OBOs. The Company also

<<<

 owns a 50% interest in a company which is the disponent owner o f a 1992-built 72,389 DW T Combination Carrier, effected through a lease structure. Each vessel accounts for a significant portion o f the Company's revenues. On July 29, 2008

<<<

, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an agreement to acquire an Accommodation Field Development Vessel ("AFDV") upon completion o f the construction o f the vessel for $35.9 million, the vessel is expected to be delivered

<<<

 in the 1st quarter o f 2010.
The Company's fleet o f MR product tankers consist o f "handy-size" vessels which are between 30,000 and 50,000 summer deadweight tons ("DWT"), and are able, by reason o f their smaller size, to transport commodities

<<<

 to and from m ost ports in the world, including those located in less developed third-world countries. The Company's Panamax product tanker is 68,500 DWT. Product (ankers arc single-deck oceangoing vessels designed to carry simultaneously a

<<<

 number o f segregated liquid bulk commodities, such as refined petroleum products, vegetable oils, caustic soda and m olasses. The Company's fleet o f OBOs are between 74,000 and 84,000 DWT. OBOs are combination carriers used to transport liquid

<<<

, iron ore or bulk products such as coal, grain, bauxite, phosphate, sugar, steel products and other dry bulk commodities.
The Company is organized as a corporation in Liberia, and its principal executive office is located at ParLaViile Place

<<<

, 14 Par-La-Ville Road, Hamilton HM 08, Bermuda (telephone number (441)295-6875).
When referred to in the context o f vessel ownership, the "Company" shall mean the wholly-owned subsidiaries o f B+H Ocean Carriers Ltd. that are registered owners

<<<

.
Recent acquisitions, disposals and other significant transactions
Loan agreements require that the Company comply with certain financial and other covenants. Due to weak market conditions the Company has been unable to comply with a particular

<<<

 covenant in four loan agreements which require that Total Value Adjusted Equity should represent not less than 30% o f Total Value Adjusted Assets. A t December 31, 2008, the actual ratio was 28.5% or 1,5% below the minimum requirement. Although

<<<

 the banks concerned have advised the Company by e-mail in each case that a waiver has been approved, which the Company believes on advice o f counsel is binding, the Company is seeking to confirm the waivers in definitive written agreements

<<<

. The Company docs not expect that it will be able to meet all prospective financial covenants o f these four loan agreement, especially if current market conditions continue. Accordingly, the Company is in negotiations with its lenders to obtain

<<<

 waivers o f future potential technical breaches o f covenants and restructure the loans. Until and unless these potential technical defaults are waived, the lenders have the right to cancel the commitment and demand repayment. Therefore, the

<<<

 Company has reclassified the following four loan agreement as current:
1) $202 m illion reducing revolving credit facility with Nordea Bank Norge ASA, or Nordea Bank, as Agent, dated August 29, 2006 (amount re-classtfied o f $57.2 million)

<<<

. The agreement requires that any modification to the financial covenants requires approval by the majority o f lenders or 66.67%. The Company requested that the Value Adjusted Equity ratio be reduced from the required 30% to 20% effective December

<<<

 31,2 0 0 8 through January 1,2010, in the form o f a waiver. The Company has been informed by the Agent that banks representing greater than 66.67% o f the loans have approved the waiver. Confirmation o f the final waiver is expected in the

<<<

 near term.
2) $30 million term loan facility with DVB Group Merchant Bank, DVB as agent, dated M ay 13, 2008 (amount re-classified o f $9.5 million). The Company has been informed by DVB Merchant Bank that it has approved the waiver to reduce

<<<

 the Value Adjusted Equity ratio from the required 30% to 20% effective December 31, 2008 through January 1, 2010. Confirmation o f the final waiver is expected in the near term.
3) $26.7 million term loan facility with Nordea Bank Norge ASA

<<<

, dated October 25, 2007 (amount re-classified o f $9.6 million). The Company has been informed by Nordea Bank that it has approved the waiver to reduce the Value Adjusted Equity ratio from the required 30% to 20% effective December 3 ), 20

<<<

08 through January 1, 2010. Confirmation o f the final waiver is expected in the near term.
4) $8 million term loan facility with Nordea Bank Norge ASA; dated September 5, 2006 (amount re-classified $1.5 million). The Company has been informed

<<<

 by Nordea Bank that it has approved the waiver to reduce the Value Adjusted Equity ratio from the required 30% to 20% effective December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 through January 1 ,2 010. Confirmation o f the final waiver is expected in (he near term.

<<<


In addition, these potential technical defaults might trigger certain cross-default provisions or potential defaults under material adverse change covenants within the remaining loan documents. A s a result the Company reclassified its remaining

<<<

 long term debt o f $48.9 m illion as current at December 31, 2008. This additional reclassification applies to three debt agreements as follows:
1) $34,000,000 term loan facility with Bank o f Scotland dated December 7,2007 (amount reclassified

<<<

 o f $16.6 million);
2) $27,300,000 term loan facility with Bank o f Nova Scotia dated January 24,2007 (amount reclassified o f $16.8 million); and
3) $25,000,000 Unsecured Bonds with Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, as Loan Trustee, dated December 1

<<<

2 ,2006 (amount reclassified o f SI 5.5 million).
A violation o f the Company's financial covenants may constitute an event o f default under its credit facilities, which would, unless waived by its lenders, provide its lenders with the right

<<<

 to require the Company to refrain from declaring and paying dividends and borrowing additional funds under the credit facility, post additional collateral, enhance its equity and liquidity, increase its interest payments, pay down its indebtedness

<<<

 to a level where it are in compliance with its loan covenants, sell vessels in its fleet, reclassify its indebtedness as current liabilities and accelerate its indebtedness and foreclose their liens on its vessels, which would impair the Company

<<<

's ability to continue to conduct its business. A total o f $175.8 m illion o f indebtedness has been reclassified as current liabilities in the Company's audited consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 3 f , 2008, included in

<<<

 this report.
I f current market conditions continue, the Company does not expect that it will be able to meet all financial covenants o f its credit facilities in the foreseeable future in the absence o f further agreement with its lenders

<<<

. The Company is currently in discussions with its lenders to restructure its facilities including amendments to certain financial covenants, although the Company cannot assure you that it w ill be successful reaching an agreement with its lenders

<<<

. In addition, in connection with any waiver or amendment to the Company's credit facilities, its lenders may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on it or modify the terms o f its credit facility. These restrictions may limit

<<<

 the Company's ability to, among other things, pay

dividends in the future, make capital expenditures or incur additional indebtedness, including through the issuance o f guarantees. In addition, its lenders may require the payment o f additional

<<<

 fees, require prepayment o f a portion o f its indebtedness to them, accelerate the amortization schedule for its indebtedness and increase the interest rates they charge it on its outstanding indebtedness. I f the Company's indebtedness is

<<<

 accelerated, it would be very difficult in the current financing environment for the Company to refinance its debt or obtain additional financing and it could lose its vessels if its lenders foreclose their liens.
On January 15, 2009, the Company

<<<

, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold the M /V ALGONQUIN for $18.0 million. N o gain or loss was recorded as the carrying value was written down to estimated fair value during 2008, resulting in an impairment charge o f $7.4 million during

<<<

 2008. Accordingly an impairment charge o f $7.4 million was included in the Consolidated Statements o f Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2008,
On July 29, 2008, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Straits Offshore Ltd. ("straits

"), entered into an agreement to acquire an Accommodation Field Development Vessel ("AFDV") upon completion o f the construction o f the vessel for $35.9 million. On September 4, 2008, an amendment was agreed under which the price was increased

<<<

 by $2.6 million to $38.5 million to provide for the purchase o f additional equipment. The purchase is secured by a $25.8 million letter o f credit, which is secured, inter alia, by the common shares o f such whollyowned subsidiary and its

 $2.2 million), respectively. The vessel is expected to be delivered in the first quarter o f 2010.
On May 13, 2008, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a $30 million term loan facility to finance the previously completed

B. Business overview
Management o f the Company
The shipowning activities o f the Company are managed by BHM under a Management Services Agreement (the "Management

<<<

 Agreement") dated June 27, 1988 and amended on October 10, 1995, subject to the oversight and direction o f the Company's Board o f Directors.
The shipowning activities o f the Company entail three separate functions, all under the overall

<<<

 control and responsibility o f BHM: (1) the shipowning function, which is that o f an investment manager and includes the purchase and sale o f vessels and other shipping interests; (2) the marketing and operations function which involves the

<<<

 deployment and operation o f the vessels; and (3) the vessel technical management function, which encompasses the day-to-day physical maintenance, operation and crewing o f the vessels.
BHM employs Navinvcsl Marine Services (USA) Inc, ("NMS

<<<

"), a Connecticut corporation, under an agency agreement, to assist with the performance o f certain o f its financial reporting and administrative duties under the Management Agreement.
The Management Agreement may be terminated by the Company

<<<

 in the following circumstances: (i) certain events involving the bankruptcy or insolvency o f BHM; (ii) an act o f fraud, embezzlement or other serious criminal activity by Michael S. Hudnerwith respect to the Company; (iii) gross negligence

<<<

 or willful misconduct by BHM; or (iv) a change in control o f BHM.
Marketing and operations o f vessels
One o f the Company's vessels is time chartered to Product Transport Corp. Ltd, ("PROTRANS"), a Bermuda Corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary

<<<

 o f the Company, on an open rate basis as described hereunder.
BHM is the manager o f PROTRANS and has delegated certain administrative, marketing and operational functions to NM S and Product Transport (S) Ptc. Ltd, a Singapore corporation

<<<

, under agency agreements.
PROTRANS subcharters the vessels on a voyage charier or time charter basis to third party charterers. Under a voyage charter, PROTRANS agrees to provide a vessel for the transport o f cargo between specific ports in

<<<

 return for the payment o f an agreed freight per ton o f cargo or an agreed lump sum amount. Voyage costs, such as canal and port charges and bunker (fuel) expenses, arc the responsibility o f PROTRANS. A single voyage charter (generally three

<<<

 to ten w eeks) is commonly referred to as a spot market charter, and a voyage charter involving more than one voyage is commonly referred to as a consecutive voyage charter. Under a time charter, PROTRANS places a vessel at the disposal o f

<<<

 a subcharterer for a given period o f time in return for the payment o f a specified rale per DW T capacity per month or a specified rate o f hire per day. Voyage costs arc the responsibility o f the subcharlerer. In both voyage charters and

<<<

 lim e charters, operating costs (such as repairs and maintenance, crew w ages and insurance premiums) arc the responsibility o f the shipowner.
Voyage and lime charters can be for varying periods o f lime, ranging from a single trip to terms

<<<

 approximating the useful life o f a vessel, depending on the evaluation o f market trends by PROTRANS and by subcharterers. Long-term charters afford greater assurance that the Company w ill be able to cover their costs (including depreciation

<<<

, debt service, and operating costs), and afford subcharterers greater stability o f transportation costs. Operating or chartering a vessel in the spot market affords both PROTRANS and subcharterers greater speculative opportunities, which may

 result in high rales when ships are in demand or low rates (possibly insufficient to cover costs) when ship availability exceeds demand. Charter rates arc affected by world economic conditions, international events, weather conditions, strikes

<<<

, government policies, supply and demand, and many other factors beyond the control o f PROTRANS and the Company.
Vessel Technical Management
At December 31, 2008, BHM was the technical manager o r all o f the Company's vessels, under technical

<<<

 management agreements. BHM employs B+H Equimar Singapore Pie. Ltd. ("BHES"), a Singapore corporation, under agency agreements to assist with certain o f its duties under the technical management agreements. The vessel technical manager is responsible

<<<

 for all technical aspects o f day-to-day vessel operations, including physical maintenance, provisioning and crewing, and receives compensation o f $13,844 per MR product tanker per month and $16,762 per Panamax product tanker or OBO per month

<<<

, which may be adjusted annually for any increases in the Consumer Price Index. Such supervision includes the establishment o f operating budgets and the review o f actual operating expenses against budgeted expenses on a regular basis.

Insurance

<<<

 and Safely
The business o f the Company is affected by a number o f risks, including mechanical failure o f the vessels, collisions, property loss to the vessels, cargo Joss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances

<<<

 in foreign countries, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, the operation o f any ocean-going vessel is subject to the inherent possibility o f catastrophic marine disaster, including oil spills and other environmental mishaps, and the

<<<

 liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. The Oil Pollution Act `90 ("OPA90"), by imposing potentially unlimited liability upon owners, operators and bareboat charterers for certain oil pollution accidents

<<<

 in the United Slates, has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators and has also caused insurers to consider reducing available liability coverage.
The Company maintains hull and machinery and war risks insurance

<<<

, which include the risk o f actual or constructive total loss, protection and indemnity insurance with mutual assurance associations and loss o f hire insurance, on all its vessels. The Company believes that its current insurance coverage is

<<<

 adequate to protect it against most accident-related risks involved in the conduct o f its business and that it maintains appropriate levels o f environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage. Currently, the available amount o f coverage

<<<

 for pollution is $1 billion per vessel per incident. However, there can be no assurance that all risks arc adequately insured against, that any particular claim will be paid or that the Company will be able to procure adequate insurance coverage

<<<

 at commercially reasonable rates in the future.
Competition
The product tanker industry is fragmented. Competition in the industry among vessels approved by major oil companies is primarily based on price. There arc approximately 1,100 crude

<<<

 oil and product tankers worldwide o f between 25,000 and 50,000 DWT. Tankers arc typically owned in groups or pools controlling up to 30 tankers.
The OBO industry is also fragmented and competition is also primarily based on price, but also

<<<

 vessel specification and age. There are approximately 76 OBOs worldwide, 39 o f which arc between 50,000 and 100,000 DWT. In this size range, the largest ownership group has an estimated six vessels. Other vessels are owned in groups o f four

<<<

 or icss.
The Company competes principally with other handysize vessel owners through (he global tanker charter market, which is comprised o f tanker brokers representing both charterers and ship owners. Chartcrparfics are quoted on cither an

<<<

 open or private basis. Requests for quotations on an open charter are usually made by major oil companies on a general basis to a large number o f vessel operators. Com petition for open charters can be intense and involves vessels owned by

<<<

 operators such as other major oil companies, oil traders and independent ship owners. Requests for quotations on a private basis arc made to a limited number o f vessel operators and are greatly influenced by prior customer relationships. The

<<<

 Company bids for both open and private charters.
Competition generally intensifies during times o f low market activity when several vessels may bid to transport the same cargo. In these situations, the Company's customer relationships are

<<<

 paramount, often allow ing the Company the opportunity o f first refusal on the cargo. The Company b elieves that it has a significant competitive advantage in the handysize tanker market as a result o f the quality and type o f its vessels

<<<

 and through its close customer relationships, particularly in the Atlantic and in the Indo-Asia Pacific Region. Some o f the Company's competitors, however, have greater financial strength and capital resources.
Seasonality
Although the Company

<<<

's liquid cargo trade is affected by seasonal oil uses, such as heating in winter and increased automobile use in summer, the volume o f liquid cargo transported generally remains the same through the year, with rales firmer in midwinter and

<<<

 midsummer and softer in the spring.
Inspection by Classification Society
The hull and machinery o f every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country o f registry. The classification society certifies

<<<

 that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations o f the country o f registry o f the vessel and the Safety o f Life at Sea Convention. The Company's fleet is currently enrolled with the American Bureau

<<<

 o f Shipping, Bureau Veritas, D el Norske Veritas, Class NKK and Lloyds.
A vessel must be inspected by a surveyor o f the classification society every year ("Annual Survey"), every two and a half years ("Intermediate Survey") and every five

<<<

 years ("Special Survey"). In lieu o f a Special Survey, a shipowner has the option o f arranging with the classification society for the vessel's machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed over

<<<

 a five-year period. The Company's vessels are on Special Survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous survey cycles for machinery inspection. Every vessel 15 years and older is also required to be drydockcd at least twice in a five-year

<<<

 period for inspection o f underwater parts o f (he vessel.
I f any defects are found in the course o f a survey or drydockiug, the classification surveyor will require immediate rectification or issue a "condition o f class" under which the

<<<

 appropriate repairs must be carried out within a prescribed time limit. The hull Special Survey includes measurements o f the thickness o f the steel structures in the hull o f the vessel. Should the thickness be found to be less than class

<<<

 requirements, steel renewals will be prescribed. Substantial expense may be incurred on steel renewal to pass a Special Survey if the vessel has suffered excessive corrosion.
In January 1997, BHES was awarded its International Safety Management

<<<

 ("ISM") Document o f Compliance by Lloyd's Register, certifying that BHES complied with the requirements o f the International Management Code for the Safe Operation o f Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code). Following the award o f

<<<

 the Document o f Compliance ("DOC"), each individual vessel in the fleet under management was audited by Lloyds Register for compliance with the documented BHES management procedures on which the DOC is based. After the audit, each vessel was

<<<

 awarded a ship specific Safe Management Certificate ("SMC"). Both the DOC and the SMC are subject to annual internal and external audits over a five year period. A successful renewal audit o f the DOC w as conducted by Lloyds Register on February

<<<

 7, 2002. However, the Company entered into a Master Service Agreement ("M SA") with the American Bureau o f Shipping on April 27, 2000. To conform to the M SA and to streamline a periodic revision o f our safety procedures, American Bureau

<<<

 o f Shipping was requested to undertake an audit o f the Company's compliance with the ISM Code. This audit w as successfully completed on November 2, 2007 and new DOC's were issued by American Bureau o f Shipping.
Regulation
The business o

<<<

 f the Company and the operation o f its vessels are materially affected by government regulation in the form o f international conventions, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which the vessels operate

<<<

, as w ell as in the country or countries o f their registration. Because such conventions, laws and regulations arc subject to revision, it is difficult to predict what legislation, if any, may be promulgated by any country or authority. The

<<<

 Company also cannot predict the ultimate cost o f complying with such conventions, laws and regulations, or the impact thereof on the resale price or useful life o f its vessels. Various governmental and quasi-governmcntal agencies require

<<<

 the Company to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to the operation o f its vessels. Subject to the discussion b elow and to the fact that the required permits, licenses and certificates depend upon a number o f factors

<<<

, the Company believes that it has been and will be able to obtain all permits, licenses and certificates material to the conduct o f its operations.
The Company believes that the heightened environmental and quality concerns o f insurance underwriters

<<<

, regulators and charterers will impose greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels in the tanker market. The Company's v essels are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections by a variety o f governmental and private

<<<

 interests, each o f whom may have a different perspective and standards. These interests include Coast Guard, port state, classification society, flag state administration (country o f registry) and charterers, particularly major oil companies

<<<

 which conduct vetting inspections and terminal operators.
Environmental Regulation-JMO. On March 6, 1992, the International Maritime Organization ("IMO") adopted regulations under Annex I (oil) o f MARPOL (the International Convention for the

<<<

 Prevention o f Pollution from Ships) that set forth new pollution prevention requirements applicable to tankers. These regulations required that crude tankers o f 20,000 DWT and above and product tankers o f 30,000 DW T and above, which did

<<<

 not have protective segregated ballast tanks (PL/SBT) and which were 25 years old, were to be fitted with double sides and double bottoms. Product tankers o f 30,000 DW T and above, which did have SBT, were exempt until they reached the age

<<<

 o f 30, From July 6, 1993 all newbuildiug tankers were required to be of double hull construction. In addition, existing tankers were subject to an Enhanced Survey Program.
On September 1, 2002, revised MARPOL regulations for the phase-out

<<<

 o f single hull tankers took effect. Under these revised regulations, single hull crude tankers o f 20,000 DWT and above and single hull product carriers o f 30,000 DW T and above were to be phased out by certain scheduled dates between 20

<<<

03-2015, depending on age, type o f oil carried and vessel construction. The Revised Regulations applied only to tankers carrying petroleum products and thus did not apply to tankers carrying noxious liquid substances, vegetable or animal oils

<<<

 or other non-petroleum liquids.
Under further revisions to the MARPOL regulations, which were adopted on December 4, 2003, the final phasing out dale for Category 1 tankers (principally those not fitted with PL/SBT) was brought forward to 

<<<

2005 from 2007 and the final phasing out date for Category 2 tankers (principally those fitted with PL/SBT) was brought forward to 2010 from 2015. The Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS) was also to be made applicable to all single hull tankers

<<<

 o f 15 years or older, rather than just to Category I tankers continuing to trade after 2005 and to Category 2 tankers continuing to trade after 2 0 )0 . Flag stales were permitted to allow continued operation o f Category 2 tankers beyond

<<<

 2010 subject to satisfactory results from the CAS and provided that the continued operation did not extend beyond 2015 or the date on which the vessel reached 25 years o f age. Flag states were also permitted to allow continued operation o

<<<

 f Category 2 tankers beyond 2010 if they were fitted with qualifying double sides or double bottoms, provided that the continued operation did not extend beyond the date on which the vessel reached 25 years o f age. Notwithstanding these rights

<<<

 o f flag states to allow continued operation beyond 2010, port states were permitted to deny entry by single hull tankers after 2010 and tankers with qualifying double sides or double bottoms after 2015,

N ew MARPOL regulations were also

<<<

 introduced in respect o f the carriage o f Heavy Grade Oil (HGO). HGO includes crude oil having a density higher than 900kg/m3 at 15 degrees C and fuels oils having a density higher than 900kg/m3 at 15 degrees C o ra kinematic viscosity higher

<<<

 than 180mm2/s at 50 degrees C. Notwithstanding these regulations, any parly to MARPOL would be entitled to deny entry o f single hull tankers carrying HGO, which had been otherwise allowed to carry such cargo under MARPOL, into the ports and

<<<

 offshore terminals under its jurisdiction. From October 21,2 0 0 3 and subject to certain exceptions, all HGO to or from European Union ports must be carried in tankers o f double hull construction
The phase out dales for the purposes o f carriage

<<<

 o f petroleum products under MARPOL, for the vessels currently owned by the Company, are set out in the table below. In October 2004, a revision was adopted to MARPOL Annex II where noxious liquid substances (NLS) such as all vegetable oils

<<<

 will be required to be carried on vessels complying with the International Bulk Chemical Code (3BC). The revision came into force on January 1, 2007. These regulatory changes have led the Company to believe that structural modifications to

<<<

 its existing fleet may provide the best solution to the phase-out issues for single hull tankers. Accordingly, four o f the Company's MR tankers were retrofitted with double-hulls in 2006 and 2007 and two were converted to a bulk carrier in

<<<

 2008.
In short, the 1MO regulations, which have been adopted by over 150 nations, including many o f the jurisdictions in which our tankers operate, provide for, among other things, phase out o f single-hulled taukers and more stringent inspection

<<<

 requirements; including, in part, that:
· tankers between 25 and 30 years old must be o f double-hulled construction or o f a mid-deck design with double-sided construction, unless: (I ) they have wing tanks or double bottom spaces not used

<<<

 for the carriage o f oil, which cover at least 30% o f the length o f the cargo tank section o f the hull or bottom; or (2) they are capable o f hydrostatically balanced loading (loading less cargo into a tanker so that in the event o f a breach

<<<

 o f the hull, water flow s into the tanker, displacing oil upwards instead o f into the sea);
 tankers 30 years old or older must be o f double-hulled construction or mid-deck design with double sided construction; and · all tankers arc subject

<<<

 to enhanced Inspections.
Also, under IMO regulations, a tanker must be o f double-hulled construction or a mid-deck design with double-sided construction or be o f another approved design ensuring the same level o f protection against oil pollution

<<<

 if the tanker:
· is the subject o f a contract for a major conversion or original construction on or after July 6, 1993; · commences a major conversion or has Its keel laid on or after January 6, 1994; or · completes a major conversion or is

<<<

 a newbuilding delivered on or after July 6 ,1 996.
The IMO has also negotiated international conventions that impose liability for oil pollution in international waters and a signatory's territorial waters. In September 1997, the IMO adopted

<<<

 Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention to address air pollution from ships. Annex VI was ratified in M ay 2004, and became effective M ay 19, 2005. Annex VI, set limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide em issions from ship exhausts and prohibits

<<<

 deliberate em issions o f ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content o f fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur

<<<

 emissions. Vessels built before 2002 are not obligated to comply with regulations pertaining to nitrogen oxide emissions. The Company believes that all our vessels arc currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations. Additional

<<<

 or new conventions, laws and regulations m aybe adopted that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, results o f operations and financial condition.
The IMO also has adopted the International Convention for the Safety o f Life at Sea

<<<

, or SOLAS Convention, which imposes a variety o f standards to regulate dcsigu and operational features o f ships. SOLAS standards are revised periodically. We believe that all our vessels are in substantial compliance with SOLAS standards

<<<

.
Under the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation o f Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, the party with operational control o f a vessel is required to develop an extensive safety management

<<<

 system that includes, among other things, the adoption o f a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its v essels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. In

<<<

 1994, the ISM Code became mandatory with the adoption o f Chapter IX o f SOLAS. We intend to rely on the safely management system that BHM has developed.
The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for

<<<

 each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel's management with code requirements for a safely management system. N o vessel can obtain a certificate unless its operator has been awarded a document o f compliance

<<<

, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. Wc believe that has all material requisite documents o f compliance for its offices and safety management certificates for vessels in our fleet for which the certificates are required by the IMO

<<<

. BHM will be required to review these documents o f compliance and safely management certificates annually.
Noncompliauce with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner to increased liability, may lead to decreases in

<<<

 available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial o f access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard and European Union authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the

<<<

 ISM Code will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports.
Environmental Regulation-OPA90/CERCLA. OPA90 established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup o f oil spills. OPA90

<<<

 affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade with the United Slates or its territories or possessions, or w hose vessels operate in the waters o f the United States, which include the U nited Stales territorial sea and the two hundred

<<<

 nautical mile exclusive economic zone o f the United States. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") applies to the discharge o f hazardous substances, which the Company's vessels are capable o f

<<<

 carrying.
Under OPA90, vessel owners, operators and bareboat (or "demise") charterers are "responsible parties" who are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission o f a third party, an act

<<<

 o f God or an act o f war) for all oil spill containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from oil spills caused by their vessels. These other damages are defined broadly to include (i) natural resource damages and the costs o f

<<<

 assessment thereof, (ii) real and personal properly damages, (iii) net loss o f taxes, royalties, rents, fees and other lost natural resources damage, (v) net cost o f public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from

<<<

 fire, safety or health hazards, (iv) loss o f profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss o f real property, personal property and natural resources, and (v) loss o f subsistence use o f natural resources. OPA

<<<

9G limits the liability o f responsible parties (o the greater o f $ 1,200 per gross ton or $10 m illion per tanker that is over 3,000 gross tons and S600 per gross ton or $500,000 for non-tanker vessels (subject to possible adjustment for inflation

<<<

). CERCLA, which applies to owners and operators o f vessels, contains a similar liability regime and provides for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater o f $300 per gross ton or $5 million

<<<

. These limits o f liability would not apply if the incident were proximately caused by violation o f applicable United States federal safety, construction or operating regulations, or by the responsible party's gross negligence or willful misconduct

<<<

, or if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to cooperate and assist in connection with the oil removal activities. OPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under other laws, including maritime tort

<<<

 law. OPA90 specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, and some slates that have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability

<<<

 for oil spills. In some cases, states, which have enacted such legislation, have not yet issued implementing regulations defining tanker owners' responsibilities under these laws. Moreover, OPA90 and CERCLA preserve the right to recover damages

<<<

 under existing law, including maritime tort law. The Company intends to comply with all applicable slate regulations in the ports where its vessels call.
The Company currently maintains and plans to continue to maintain pollution liability

<<<

 insurance for its vessels in the amount o f $1 billion. A catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available, in which event there could be a material adverse effect on the Company. OPA90 does not by ils terms impose liability

<<<

 on lenders or the holders o f mortgages on vessels.
Under OPA90, with certain limited exceptions, all newly built or converted tankers operating in United Stales waters must be built with double-hulls, and existing vessels that do not comply

<<<

 with the double-hull requirement must be phased out over a 20-ycar period (1995-2015) based on size, age and place o f discharge, unless retrofitted with double-hulls. Notwithstanding the phase-out period, OPA90 currently permits existing single

<<<

-hull tankers to operate until the year 2015 i f their operations within United Stales waters are limited to dischargingat the Louisiana Off-Shore Oil Platform, or off-loading by means o f lightering activities within authorized lightering zones

<<<

 more than 60 miles offshore.
OPA90 expands the pre-existing financial responsibility requirements for vessels operating in United States waters and requires owners and operators o f vessels to establish and mainlain with the Coast Guard evidence

<<<

 o f financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit o f their potential strict liability under OPA90. In December 1994, the Coast Guard enacted regulations requiring evidence o f financial responsibility in the amount o f $1,500 per gross

<<<

 ton for tankers, coupling the OPA limitation on liability o f $1,200 per gross ton with the CERCLA liability limit o f $300 per gross ton. Under the regulations, such evidence o f financial responsibility may be demonstrated by insurance, surety

<<<

 bond, self-insurance or guaranty. Under OPA90 regulations, an owner or operator o f more than one tanker will be required to demonstrate evidence o f financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal only to the financial responsibility

<<<

 requirement o f the tanker having the greatest maximum strict liability under OPA90/CERCLA. The Company has provided requisite guarantees from a Coast Guard approved mutual insurance organization and received certificates o f financial responsibility

<<<

 from the Coast Guard for each vessel required to have one.
The Coast Guard's regulations concerning certificates o f financial responsibility provide, in accordance with OPA90 and CERCLA, that claimants may bring suit directly against an insurer

<<<

 or guarantor that furnishes certificates o f financial responsibility; and, in the event that such insurer or guarantor is sued directly, it is prohibited from asserting any defense that it may have had against the responsible party and is

<<<

 limited to asserting those defenses available to the responsible party and the defense that the incident was caused by the willful misconduct o f the responsible party. Certain insurance organizations, which typically provide guarantees for

<<<

 certificates o f financial responsibility, including the major protection and indemnity organizations which the Company would normally expect to provide guarantees for a certificate o f financial responsibility on its behalf, declined to furnish

<<<

 evidence o f insurance for vessel owners and operators if they are subject to direct actions or required to w aive insurance policy defenses.

Owners or operators o f tankers operating in the waters o f the United States were required to file

<<<

 vessel response plans with the Coast Guard, and their tankers were required to be operating in compliance with their Coast Guard approved plans by August 18, 1993. Such response plans must, among other things, (i) address a "worst case" scenario

<<<

 and identify and ensure, through contract or other approved means, the availability o f necessary private response resources to respond to a "worst case discharge," (ii) describe crew training and drills, and (iii) identify a qualified individual

<<<

 with full authority to implement removal actions. The Company has vessel response plans approved by the Coast Guard for tankers in its fleet operating in the waters of the United States. The Coast Guard has announced it intends to propose similar

<<<

 regulations requiring certain tank v essels to prepare response plans for the release o f hazardous substances.

As discussed above, OPA does not prevent individual states from imposing their own liability regimes with respect to oil pollution

<<<

 incidents occurring within their boundaries, including adjacent coastal waters. In fact, most U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict Viability on a person for removal costs

<<<

 and damages resulting from a discharge o f oil or a release o f a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law.

The phase out dates for the purposes o f carriage o f petroleum products under OPA90, for the vessels

 currently owned by the Company, are set out in the table below.

 Although the United States is not a parly to these conventions, many countries have ratified and follow the liability scheme adopted by the IMO and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as

<<<

 amended (the "CLC") and the Convention for the Establishment o f an International Fund for Oil Pollution o f 1971, as amended ("Fund Convention"). Under these conventions, a v essel's registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage

<<<

 caused on the territorial waters o f a contracting slate by discharge o f persistent oil, subject to certain complete defenses. Under an amendment to the 1992 Protocol that became effective on November 1, 2003, for vessels o f 5,000 to 140

<<<

,000 gross tons (a unit o f measurement for the total enclosed spaces within a vessel), liability will be limited to approximately $6.88 million plus $962.24 for each additional gross ton over 5,000. For vessels o f over 140,000 gross tons,

<<<

 liability will be limited to approximately $136.89 million. A s the convention calculates liability in terms o f a basket o f currencies, these figures are based on currency exchange rates on January 19, 2005. Under the 1969 Convention, the

<<<

 right to limit liability is forfeited where the spill is caused by the owner's actual fault; under the 1992 Protocol, a shipowner cannot limit liability where the spill is caused by the owner's intentional or reckless conduct. V essels trading

<<<

 in jurisdictions that are parlies to these conventions must provide evidence o f insurance covering the liability o f the owner. In jurisdictions where the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage has not been adopted

<<<

, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis o f fault or in a manner similar to that convention. W e believe that our protection and indemnity insurance w ill cover the liability under the

 plan adopted by the IMO.
Injurisdictions where the CLC has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed cither on the basis o f fault or in a manner similar to the CLC.
Additional U.S. Environmental

<<<

 Requirements. The U.S. Clean Air Act o f 1970, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments o f 1977 and 1990 (the "CAA"), requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions o f volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants

<<<

. Our vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. Our vessels that operate in such port areas are equipped

<<<

 with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements. The CAA also requires states to draft Slate Implementation Plans, or SIPs, designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in primarily major metropolitan and/or industrial

<<<

 areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation o f vapor control equipment. As indicated above, our vessels operating in covered port areas are already equipped with

<<<

 vapor control system s that satisfy these requirements. The EPA and the slate o f California, however, have each proposed more stringent regulations o f air em issions from ocean-going vessels. On July 24, 2008, the California Air Resources

<<<

 Board o f the Stale o f California, or CARB, approved clean-fuel regulations applicable to all vessels sailing within 24 miles o f the California coastline whose itineraries call for them to enter any California ports, terminal facilities,

<<<

 or internal or estuarine waters. The new CARB regulations require such vessels to use low sulfur marine fuels rather than bunker fuel. B y July 1, 2009, such vessels are required to switch either to marine gas oil with a sulfur content o f

<<<

 no more than 1.5% or marine diesel oil with a sulfur content or no more than 0.5%. B y 2012, only marine gas oil and marine diesel oil fuels with 0.1 % sulfur will be allowed. In the event our vessels were to travel within such waters, these

<<<

 new regulations would require significant expenditures on low-sulfur fuel and would increase our operating costs. Although a risk exists that new regulations could require significant capital expenditures and othenvise increase our costs, w

<<<

 e b elieve, based ou the regulations that have been proposed to date, that no material capital expenditures beyond those currently contemplated and no material increase in costs are likely to be required. The Clean Water Act ("CWA") prohibits

<<<

 the discharge o f oil or hazardous substances into navigable waters and imposes strict liability in the form o f peualties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs o f removal, remediation and

<<<

 damages. Slate laws for the control o f water pollution also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties in the case o f a discharge o f petroleum or hazardous materials into state waters. The CWA complements the remedies available

<<<

 under the more recent OPA and CERCLA, discussed above.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, historically exempted the discharge o f ballast water and other substances incidental to the normal operation o f vessels in U .S. waters

<<<

 from CWA permitting requirements. However, ou March 31, 2005, a U.S. District Court ruled that the EPA exceeded its authority in creating au exemption for ballast water. On September 18, 2006, the court issued an order invalidating the exemption

 in the EPA's regulations for all discharges incidental to the normal operation o f a vessel as o f September 30, 2008, and directed the EPA to develop a system for regulating all discharges from v essels by that date. The District Court's decision

<<<

 was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court o f Appeals on July 23,2008. The Ninth Circuit's ruling meant that owners and operators o f vessels traveling in U.S. waters would soon be required to comply with the CWA permitting program to be developed

<<<

 by the EPA or face penalties. In response to the invalidation and removal o f the EPA's vessel exemption by the Ninth Circuit, the EPA has enacted rules governing the regulation o f ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to

<<<

 the normal operation o f vessels within U.S. waters. Under the new rules, which look effect February 6, 2009, commercial vessels 79 feet in length or longer (other than commercial fishing vessels), or Regulated V essels, arc required to obtain

<<<

 a CWA permit regulating and authorizing such normal discharges. This permit, which the EPA has designated as the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation o f Vessels, or VGP, incorporates the current U.S. Coast

<<<

 Guard requirements for ballast water management as well as supplemental ballast water requirements, and includes limits applicable to 26 specific discharge streams, such as deck runoff, bilge water and gray water. For each discharge type, among

<<<

 other things, the VGP establishes effluent limits pertaining to the constituents found in the effluent, including best management practices, or BMPs, designed to decrease the amount o f constituents entering the waste stream. Unlike land-based

<<<

 discharges, which are deemed acceptable by meeting certain EPA-imposed numerical effluent limits, each o f the 26 VGP discharge limits is deemed to be met when a Regulated V essel carries out the BMPs pertinent to that specific discharge stream

<<<

. The VGP imposes additional requirements on certain Regulated Vessel types, that emit discharges unique to those vessels. Administrative provisions, such as inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements are also included

<<<

 for all Regulated Vessels. On August 31, 2008, the District Court ordered that the date for implementation o f the VGP be postponed from September 30, 2008 until December 19, 2008. This date was further postponed until February 6, 2009 by the

<<<

 District Court. Although the VGP became effective on February 6, 2009, the VGP application procedure, known as the Notice o f Intent, orNOI, has yet to be finalized. Accordingly, Regulated Vessels will effectively be covered under the VGP from

<<<

 February 6, 2009 until June 19, 2009, at which time the "eNOI" electronic filing interface will become operational. Thereafter, owners and operators o f Regulated V essels must file their NOIs prior to September 19, 2009, or the Deadline. Any

<<<

 Regulated Vessel that does not file an NOI by the Deadline w ill, as o f that dale, no longer be covered by the VGP and will not be allowed to discharge into U .S. navigable waters until it has obtained a VGP. A ny Regulated Vessel that was

<<<

 delivered on or before the Deadline w ill receive final VGP permit coverage on the dale that the EPA receives such Regulated V essel's complete NOI. Regulated V essels delivered after the Deadline will not receive VGP permit coverage until

<<<

 30 days after their NOI submission. Our fleet is composed entirely o f Regulated Vessels, and w e intend to submit NOIs for each vessel in our fleet as soon after June 19, 2009 as practicable. In addition, pursuant to §401 o f the CWA which

<<<

 requires each state to certify federal discharge permits such as the VGP, certain stales have enacted additional discharge standards as conditions to their certification o f the VGP. These local standards bring the VGP into compliance with

<<<

 more stringent state requirements, such as those further restricting ballast water discharges and preventing the introduction o f non-indigenous species considered to be invasive. The VGP and its stale-specific regulations and any similar restrictions

<<<

 enacted in the future will increase the costs o f operating in the relevant waters.
The National Invasive Species Act ("NISA") was enacted in 1996 in response to growing reports o f harmful organisms being released into U.S. ports through ballast

<<<

 water taken on by ships in foreign ports. NISA established a ballast water management program for ships entering U.S. waters. Under NISA, mid-ocean ballast water exchange is voluntary, except for ships heading to the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay

<<<

, or vessels engaged in the foreign export o f Alaskan North Slope crude oil. However, NISA's exporting and record-keeping requirements are mandatory

for vessels bound for any port in the United Stales. Although ballast water exchange is the

<<<

 primary means o f compliance with the act's guidelines, compliance can also be achieved through the retention o f ballast water onboard the ship, or the use o f environmentally sound alternative ballast water management methods approved by

<<<

 the U .S. Coast Guard. I f the mid-occan ballast exchange is made mandatory throughout the United States, or i f water treatment requirements or options are instituted, the costs o f compliance could increase for ocean carriers.

European Union

<<<

 Tanker Restrictions. The European Union requires acceleration o f the IMO single hull tanker phase-out timetable and, by 2010, will prohibit all single-hulled tankers used for the transport o f oil from entering into its ports or offshore terminals

<<<

. The European Union, following the lead o f certain European Union nations such as Italy and Spain, has also banned all single-hulled tankers carrying heavy grades o f oil, regardless o f flag, from entering or leaving its ports or offshore

<<<

 terminals or anchoring in areas under its jurisdiction. Certain single-hulled tankers above 15 years o f age arc also restricted from entering or leaving European Union ports or offshore terminals and anchoring in areas under European Union

<<<

 jurisdiction. The European Union is also considering legislation that would: (1) ban manifestly sub-standard vessels (defined as those over 15 years old that have been detained by port authorities at least twice in a six-month period) from

<<<

 European waters and create an obligation o f port states to inspect vessels posing a high risk to maritime safely or the marine environment; and (2) provide the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies

<<<

, including the ability to seek to suspend or revoke the authority o f negligent societies. It is impossible to predict what legislation or additional regulations, i f any, may be promulgated by the European Union or any other country or authority

<<<

.

Greenhouse Gas Regulation. In February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or the Kyoto Protocol, entered into force. Pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, adopting countries are required to implement

<<<

 national programs to reduce emissions o f certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases, which are suspected o f contributing to global warming. Currently, the em issions o f greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject

<<<

 to the Kyoto Protocol. However, the European Union has indicated that it intends to propose an expansion o f the existing European U nion emissions trading scheme to include emissions o f greenhouse gases from vessels. In the United States

<<<

, the Attorneys General from 16 stales and a coalition o f environmental groups in April 2008 filed a petition for a writ o f mandamus, or petition, with the DC Circuit Court o f Appeals, or the DC Circuit, to request an order requiring the

<<<

 EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from ocean-going vessels under the Clean Air Act. Although the DC Circuit denied the petition in June 2008, any future passage o f climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO

<<<

, European Union or individual countries where w e operate that restrict emissions o f greenhouse gases could entail financial impacts on our operations that w c cannot predict with certainty at this time,

Item 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS
A. O perating results
The following is a discussion o f our fmaucia! condition and results o f operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007

<<<

 and 2006. You should read this scctiou together with the consolidated financial statements including the notes to those financial statements for the periods mentioned above.
We are a provider o f international liquid and dry bulk seaborne transportation

<<<

 services, carrying petroleum products, crude oil, vegetable oils and dry bulk cargoes. The Company operates a fleet consisting o f four M R product tankers, one Panamax product tankers, three bulk carriers and five combination carriers. The

<<<

 M R product tankers are all medium range or "handy-size" vessels which are between 30,000 and 50,000 DW T summer deadweight tons ("DW T"), and arc able, by reason o f their small size, to transport commodities to and from most ports in the

<<<

 world, including those located in less developed third-world countries. The Panamax product tanker is 68,500 DWT. Product tankers are single-deck oceangoing vessels designed to carry simultaneously a number o f segregated liquid bulk commodities

<<<

, such as petroleum products and vegetable oils. The combination carriers, known as an OBOs (oil-bulk-orc carrier), are between 74,000 and 84,000 DW T (Aframax). Combination carriers can operate as tankers or as bulk carriers. They can be used

<<<

 to transport liquid cargo including crude, fuel oils and clean petroleum products, and they can also be used to transport major dry bulk commodities, such as iron ore, coal, and grain. The three bulk carriers carry mainly bulk commodities such

<<<

 as fertilizers, steel, sugars, cement, coal and iron ore etc and range in size from 35,000 to 55,000 DWT.
The Company's fleet operates under a mix o f time aud voyage charters. Our product tankers carry primarily petroleum products and vegetable

<<<

 oils and our OBOs carry crude oil, petroleum products, iron ore and coal. Historically, w c deploy our fleet on both time charters, which can last from a few months to several years, and spot market charters, which generally last from several

<<<

 days to several weeks. Under spot market voyage charters, w c pay voyage expenses such as port, canal aud fuel costs. A lime charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period o f time at a specified daily rate. Uudcr time

<<<

 charters, the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port, canal and fuel costs. Under both types o f charters, w c pay for vessel operating expenses, which include crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance

<<<

, maintenance and repairs. W c arc also responsible for the vessel's intermediate and special survey costs.
V essels operating ou time charters provide more predictable cash flows, but can, in a strong market, yield lower profit margins than

<<<

 vessels operating in the spot market. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods o f improvements in tanker rates although w e are



<<<

exposed to the risk o f declining tanker rates, which may have a materially adverse impact on our financial performance. W e are constantly evaluating the appropriate balance between the number o f our vessels deployed on lime charter and the

<<<

 number employed on the spot market.
For discussion and analysis purposes only, w e evaluate performance using time charter equivalent, or TCE revenues. TCE revenues are voyage revenues minus direct voyage expenses. Direct voyage expenses primarily

<<<

 consist o f port, canal and fuel costs that arc unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by a charterer under a time charter, as well as comm issions. W e believe that presenting voyage revenues on a TCE basis enables a

<<<

 proper comparison to be made between vessels deployed on time charter or those deployed on the spot market.
Our voyage revenues are recognized ratably over the duration o f the voyages and the lives o f the charters, w hile vessel operating

<<<

 expenses are recognized on the accrual basis. We calculate daily TCE rates by dividing TCE revenues by voyage days for the relevant time period. We also generate demurrage revenue, which an owner charges a charterer for exceeding an agreed

<<<

 upon time to load or discharge a cargo.
W e depreciate our v essels on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives determined to be 30 years from the date o f their initial delivery from the shipyard. Depreciation is based on cost

<<<

 less the estimated residual value. W e capitalize the total costs associated with special surveys, which take place every five years and amortize them on a straight-line basis over 60 months. Regulations and/or incidents m ay change the estimated

<<<

 dates o f next drydockings.

Revenues
Revenues from voyage and time charters decreased S7.S million or 6.7% from 2007. The

<<<

 decrease is due to a 553 days (or 12%) decrease in the number o f total on-hire days from 2007 to 2008. The impact o f this decrease was offset by an increase in the TCE rate o f $1,416 per day (11%). The decrease in on-hire days is due to

<<<

 the sale ofthcM /T ACUSHNET in February 2008 and the OBO SACHUEST in March 2008. Offhirc for conversions was 555 days in 2008 and 577 days in 2007. Ollhire for scheduled drydockings w as 148 days in 2008 and 14 days in 2007.
A t December 3

<<<

1, 2008, three o f the Company's M R product tankers were employed in the voyage charter market and one on a short term time charter. The five combination carriers and the Panamax product tanker were employed on long-term time charters. The

<<<

 two bulk carriers were on short time charter and one MR product tanker was being converted to a bulk carrier.
Other revenue o f $0.9 million represents the Company's portion o f the profit sharing arrangement with the charterer o f one o f

<<<

 the Company's OBOs acquired in 2005.

Voyage expenses
Voyage expenses consist o f port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage and commercial overhead costs, including commercial management fees paid to BHM. Under a time

<<<

 charier, the Company does not incur port, canal or fuel costs. Voyage expenses increased $0.2 million, or 0.8%, to $28.1 m illion for the year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 compared to $27.9 million for the comparable period o f 2007. This is

<<<

 predominantly due to an increase in bunker costs.
Vessel operating expenses
The increase in vessel operating expenses o f $7.5 million is due in part to $1.9 million o f intermediate drydockiug expense compared to $0.5 million in 2007. In addition

<<<

, there was an increase in average daily operating expenses o f $2,239 per day. This increase w as predominantly due to increases in crew related costs, bunkers on offhirc, upgrading expenses and repairs and maintenance costs.
Depreciation and

<<<

 amortization
Depreciation increased by $1.2 million, or 8.2%, to $16.4 million due to the conversion o f the M /V SACHEM and partially offset by the sale o f two ships in the first half o f the year. Amortization o f special surveys increased

<<<

 $0.9 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 due to the fact that there were two special surveys completed during 2008 and there was a full year o f depreciation expense on the four converted vessels. Amortization o

<<<

 f debt issuance costs increased $0.4 m illion due predominantly to costs associated with new loans in 2007 and 2008 and due to the write-off o f costs related to loan prepayments. Amortization o f vessel conversion costs increased $1.1 million

 for the twelve month period ended December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 compared to $2.3 million for the prior period. The decrease is due to the one-time issuance in 2007 o f 60,000 shares o f common stock to BHM resulting in compensation expense o f $1.

<<<

1 m illion in 2007. Fees for consulting and professional fees and other expenses decreased $0.3 million or 5%. The decrease is primarily attributable to the one-time issuance o f 2,500 shares o f the Company's common slock to each director in

<<<

 2007, resulting in compensation expense o f $0.4 million.
Interest expense and interest income
The $ 1.5 million (12%) decrease in interest expense is due to the decrease in interest rates and to the reduction in mortgage indebtedness from

<<<

 $200.3 million at December 31, 2007 to $160.3 million at December 31, 2008.
Both the interest paid on the Company's debt and the interest earned on its cash balances are based on LIBOR. Interest income for 2008 o f $1.2 million represented

<<<

 a decrease o f $1.9 million or 63% o f the prior year's iulcrest income o f $3.1 million. The decrease in interest income is due to the fact that the Company had a higher average cashbalance during 2007 as compared to 2008. In addition, average

's 50% share o f a deposit forfeited when the buyer under contract to purchase M V SEAPOWET failed to take delivery o f the vessel.
Loss onfa ir value o f interest rate swaps
During 2006 and 2007, the Company entered into five interest rale

<<<

 swap agreements to mitigate the risk associated with its variable rate debt. A s o f December 31, 2008, one o f these interest rate swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting under US GAAP and, as such, the change in the fair value

<<<

 o f this swap is reflected within gain (loss) on value o f interest rate swaps in the accompanying Consolidated Statements o f Income. For the year ended D ecem b ers), 2008, the Company recognized aggregate losses o f $0.8 m illion on this

<<<

 non-qualifying swap. For the year ended December 3 1, 2007, two o f the Company's interest rate swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting. For 2007, the Company recognized aggregate losses o f $ 1.3 m illion related to these swaps

<<<

 which are reflected within gain (loss) on value o f interest rate swaps on the accompanying Consolidated Statements o f Income.
A s o f December 31, 2008, the fair value o f the non-qualifying swap agreement was a liability o f $0.5 million

<<<

. As o f December 31, 2007, the aggregate fair value o f the two non-qualifying swap agreements was a liability o f $0.9 m illion. The remaining swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges by the Company and, as such, the changes

<<<

 in the fair value o f these swaps arc reflected as a component o f other comprehensive income. As o f December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 , there were four interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges with an aggregate fair value o f liability

 $4.4 million. A s o f December 31,2007, there were three interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges with an aggregate fair value o f liability $0.8 million.
Gain onfa ir value ofput option contracts
In 2007 and 2006, the Company

 bought put options costing a total o f SI 1.1 million to mitigate the risk associated with the possibility o f falling lim e charter rales. These put options did not qualify for special hedge accounting under U S GAAP and, as such, the aggregate

<<<

 changes in the fair value o f these option contracts were reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements o f Income. The put options were sold or settled during 2008. The aggregate realized gain on the sale o f the put options totaled 

<<<

$16.1 million at December 31, 2008. The aggregate unrealized loss on the value o f the pul options totaled $3.4 million at December 31,2007.
Gain onfa ir value offoreign exchange contracts
The Company is party to foreign currency exchange contracts

<<<

 which are designed to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts, which were entered into during 2007, did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS N o. 133; and the changes in their fair

Revenues
Revenues from voyage

<<<

 and time charters increased$!5.5 m illion or 16% from 2006. The increase is due to a 4% increase in the number o f total on-hire days from 2006 to 2007 and due to the fact that there were 1,017 (136%) more voyage days in 2007 than in 2006.

<<<

 Revenue from voyage charters is recorded on a gross basis, before voyage expenses. The TCE rate increased $ 151 per day (1%). Approximately 34% o f the increase in voyage charter days is due to acquisitions in 2006 and 2007. The M/T SACHEM

<<<

 purchased in June 2006, was on time charter from its acquisition to February o f 2007, but on voyage charters thereafter. The CAPT. THOMAS J. HUDNER, which was acquired in June 2007, spent the remainder o f the year in the spot market. Another

<<<

 16% o f the increase in voyage charter days was attributable to vessels positioned for conversion during 2007. V oyage charters allowed the Company more flexibility with respect to this positioning. Finally, the spot market provided the best

<<<

 employment for the Company's MR fleet, post conversion. A t December 31, 2007, five o f the Company's seven MR product tankers were employed in the voyage charter market and one on a short term time charter. The six combination carriers and

<<<

 one o f its Panamax product tankers were employed on long-term time charters. The

remaining MR tanker and Panamax tanker are being converted to bulk carriers.
Other revenue primarily includes $1.4 million earned in respect o f the profit

<<<

 sharing arrangement with the charterer o f one o f the OBOs acquired in 2005.
Voyage expenses
Voyage expenses consist o f port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage and commercial overhead costs, including commercial

<<<

 4.8 m illion for the comparable period o f 2006. This is due to the increase in voyage days from 746 in 2006 to 1,763 in 2007. Direct voyage expenses on a per day basis decreased 7% or $827 per day, predominantly due to decreases in port charges

Interest expense and interest

<<<

 income
The $2.1 million (19%) increase in interest expense is due to the increase in outstanding debt. The average long-term debt balance for 2007 was approximately $175.9 million, as compared to approximately $143.8 m illion for 2006. The

<<<

 Company entered into a new loan agreement totaling $34.0 million on September 7, 2007 to finance conversions o f four o f its MR tankers, o f which $8.5 million was drawn down in October. The Company also drew an additional $19.6 million on

 its Cliaship Holdings facility to finance the purchase o f the MR tanker acquired in June 2007.
Both the interest paid on the Company's debt and the interest earned on its cash balances are based on LIBOR. Interest income for 2007 o f $3.1

 million represented an increase o f $0.7 million or 31% o f the prior year's interest income o f $2.4 million. The increase in interest income is due to the fact that the Company had a higher average cash balance during 2007 as compared to

<<<

 2006. In addition, average LIBOR rates o f 5.25% for 2007 were approximately 3% higher than the 2006 average o f 5.1%.

Loss onfair value o fderivatives
During 2007, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk associated with variable rate debt. Two o f these interest

<<<

 rate swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under U S GAAP and, as such, the changes in the fair value o f these swaps are reflected in the Company's Statements oflncom e. For the years ended December 31,2007 and 2006, the Company

<<<

 recognized aggregate losses o f $1.3 m illion and gains o f $0.3 million, respectively, on these non-qualifying swap agreements. The aggregate fair value o f these non qualifying swap agreements is a liability o f $0.9 million at December 

<<<

31,2 0 0 7 and an asset o f $0.3 million at December 31, 2006. The other swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges by the Company and as such, the changes in the fair value o f these swaps are reflected as a component o f other

<<<

 comprehensive income. The fair value o f these cash flow hedges are liabilities o f 5828,000 at December 31, 2007 and an asset ofSI8,000 at December 31,2006.
In 2007 and 2006, the Company bought pul options costing a total o f $11.1 million

<<<

 to mitigate the risk associated with the possibility o f falling time charter rates. These put option agreements, which were entered into during 2007 and 2006, do not qualify for special hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133; and, as such, the

<<<

 aggregate changes in the fair value o f these option contracts are reflected within gain (loss) on fair value o f derivatives on the accompanying Consolidated Statements o f Income. A s discussed above, at December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 , the put option

<<<

 contracts were sold or settled. The aggregate unrealized loss on the value o f the contracts at December 3 1 ,2 0 0 7 and 2006 totaled $3.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Loss on investment
The Company invested in an oil drilling operation

<<<

 during 2007. The investment o f $0.6 million was written o ff in the4lli quarter, when it was determined the wells would not result in any production.
B. Liquidity and capital resources
The Company requires cash to service its debt, fund the

<<<

 equity portion o f investments in vessels, fund working capital and maintain cash reserves against fluctuations in operating cash flow. N et cash flow generated by continuing operations has historically been the main source o f liquidity for

<<<

 the Company. Additional sources o f liquidity have also included proceeds from asset sales and refinancings.
The Company's ability to generate cash flow from operations w ill depend upon the Company's future performance, which will be subject

<<<

 to general economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors affecting the operations o f the Company, many o f which are beyond its control.
A s a result o f the industry-wide decline in the value o f vessels, the ratio o f

<<<

 the Company's vessel total value adjusted equity to total value adjusted assets was 28.5% at D ecem ber3I, 2008, lower than the 30% ratio required under certain o f the loan agreements. The Company may also be in technical default o f other

<<<

 covenants contained in the Company's loan agreements. These constitute potential events o f default and could result in the lenders requiring immediate repayment o f the loans. The Company has been advised by its lenders that it has agreed

<<<

 to waive the total value adjusted equity to total value adjusted assets ratio default. Accordingly, management does not expect that the lenders will demand payment o f the loans before their maturity. The Company may seek relief from other

<<<

 covenants in the future, subject to further modifications o f the terms o f the loans. Notwithstanding the waivers, the Company plans to classify all or a portion o f the related debt as current. In addition, the Company may seek to raise additional

<<<

 liquidity from other strategic alternatives.
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm issued their opinion on the Company's financial statements contained elsewhere in this report with an explanatory

paragraph that expresses

<<<

 doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification o f assets or the amounts and

<<<

 classification o f liabilities that may result from the outcome o f its potential inability to continue as a going concern.
The Company's fleet consists o f product tankers, bulk carriers and OBOs; accordingly, the Company is dependent upon

<<<

 the petroleum product, vegetable oil and chemical industries and the bulk products market as its primary sources o f revenue. These industries have historically been subject to substantial fluctuation as a result of, among other things, economic

<<<

 conditions in general and demand for petroleum products, vegetable oil, ore, other bulk, and chemicals in particular. Any material seasonal fluctuation in (he industry or any material diminution in the level o f activity therein could have

<<<

 a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operating results. The profitability o f product tankers and their asset value results from changes in the supply o f and demand for such capacity. The supply o f such capacity is a function

<<<

 o f the number o f new v essels being constructed and the number o f older vessels that are laid-up or scrapped. The demand for product (anker capacity is influenced by global and regional economic conditions, increases and decreases in industrial

<<<

 production and demand for petroleum products, vegetable oils and chemicals, developments in international trade and changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns. The nature, timing and degree o f change in these industry conditions

<<<

 are unpredictable as a result o f the many factors affecting the supply o f and demand for capacity. Although there can be no assurance that the Company's business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels, the Company

<<<

 believes it will generate cash flow at levels sufficient to service its liquidity requirements in the future.
Cash at December 31, 2008, amounted to $30.5 million, a decrease o f $31.1 million as compared to December 31, 2007. The decrease

<<<

 in the cash balance is attributable to net inflows from investing activities o f SI 6.8 million, which were offset by outflows from operating activities o f $0.8 million and outflows from financing activities o f $47.2 million.
During the year

<<<

 ended Decem ber 31 ,2 0 0 8 , inflows from investing activities were primarily attributable to an investment in vessel conversion costs o f $34.3 million, an investment in the Accommodation Field Development V essel o f $6.8 million and to

<<<

 the investment in Nordan OBO 2 o f $3.9 million. This was offset by proceeds from the sale o f M /T ACUSHNET iu February 2008 and M V SACHUEST in M ay 2008 fora tola) o f $38.1 million, to the proceeds from the sale or settlement o f put contracts

<<<

 o f $21.8 million and to the net redemption o f marketable securities of $0.5 million.
During the year ended Decem ber 31, 2008, outflows from financing activities included $70.0 million in payments o f mortgage principal and investment in

<<<

 the Company's outstanding bonds o f $2.2 million. The Company also acquired treasury shares for $4.7 million and paid debt issuance costs o f $0.3 million. These costs were offset by mortgage proceeds o f $30.0 m illion to finance the conversion

<<<

 o f one o f the Company's product tankers to bulk carrier. The company had total loan prepayments o f $19.2 million due to the sale o f M/T SACHUEST and the prepayment o f a portion o f the Sachem loan (see NOTE 6 to Consolidated Financial

<<<

 Statements),
The Company had a working capital deficit o f$ !5 1 .3 millionat December 31, 2008 as compared to a positive working capital of$J4.3 m illiojiatD ecem ber31,2007. The decrease o f working capital during 2008 is primarily due to

<<<

 the reclassification o f $126.8 m illion from long term debt to current mortgage payable as a result o f a technical breach in certain loan agreements as outlined in Note 3. The decrease also includes the reduction o f long-term debt, cash

<<<

 payments related to the conversion o f certain vessels and upgrades o f the accommodation barge. Management continues to tighten spending to reserve sufficient capital to serve its debt obligations. It is important to note that it is customary

<<<

 for shipping companies and their lenders to exclude the current portion o f long-term debt in any working capita) analysis. Excluding the current portion o f long-term debt, the Company had working capital totaling $24.5 million at December

<<<

 31,2008 as compared to S51.1 millionat Decem ber31,2007.
Our Joan agreements require that we maintain certain financial and other covenants. A violation o f these covenants constitutes an event o f default under our credit facilities, which

<<<

 would, unless waived by our lenders, provide our lenders with the right to require us to post additional collateral, enhance our equity and liquidity, increase our interest payments, pay down our indebtedness to a level where w e are in compliance

<<<

 with our loan covenants, sell vessels in our fleet, rec)assify our indebtedness as current liabilities and accelerate our indebtedness, which would impair our ability to continue to conduct our business. A total o f $126.8 million o f indebtedness

<<<

 has been reclassified as current liabilities in our audited consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 as a result o f a technical breach o f a certain covenant contained in four loan agreements.
Trade accounts receivable

<<<

 decreased by $2.2 million from December 31,2 0 0 7 to December 31 ,2 0 0 8 . The decrease is predominantly attributable to the reduction in the number o f voyage days during the year.
At December 31, 2008, the Company's largest five accounts

<<<

 receivable balances represented 92% o f total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2007, the Company's largest five accounts receivable balances represented 86% o f total accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $253,00

<<<

0 and $336,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. To dale, the Company's actual losses o n past due receivables have not exceeded its estimate o f bad debts.
Revenue from one customer accounted for $34.5 million (33.1%) o f total revenues

<<<

 in 2008. During 2007, revenues from one customer accounted for $35.6 million (31.6%) o f total revenues. Revenue from one customer accounted for $32.9 million (34.0%) o f total revenues in 2006.
Inventories decreased $0.6 m illion primarily

<<<

 due to the fact that there were only five ships on voyage charters or offhire at December 31, 2008 versus seven at December 31, 2007. Bunker inventory is owned by the shipowner when the vessel is on a voyage or oflhire, but is owned by the

<<<

 charterer when the vessel is on time charter.
Vessels and capital improvements, net o f accumulated depreciation, amounted to approximately $282.2 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in vessels at a cost o f $14.4 million was due to

<<<

 the conversions to bulk carriers and the investment in SAFECOM 1, partially offset by the cost o f the two vessels sold during 2008 and the impairment charge on the vessel delivered to the buyer in January 2009. This was offset by depreciation

<<<

 and amortization o f special survey and conversion costs !ota)ing$7.7 million.
At December 31,20 0 8 , the pul option contracts were sold or settled. The aggregate realized gain on the sale o f contracts totaled $16.1 m illion for the year

<<<

 ending December 31, 2008.
Other assets decreased $0.8 m illion as a result o f amortization and write-off o f debt issuance costs.
Accounts payable decreased $15.4 million and accrued liabilities increased $2.5 million from December 31,200

<<<

7 to December 31,2008. The net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is due to the fact that final payment was made toward conversions o f three tankers to double hulled vessel in 2007 which were financed under an installment

<<<

 plan with the shipyard and to the conversion o f two vessels to bulk carriers which had been fully paid for at December 31, 2008.
Deferred income o f $6.8 million at December 3 1, 2008 represents an increase o f $0.2 million as compared to

<<<

 2007. The increase is due to numerous changes in the liming o f charter hire and freight payments.
Expenses for drydock and related repair work totaled $1.9 m illion for one vessel in 2008, $0.5 million for three vessels in 2007 and $0.1 million

<<<

 for one vessel in 2006. At December 31, 2008 and 2007 there were one and two vessels, respectively, in the shipyard being converted to bulk carriers. The capitalized cost o f scheduled classification survey and related vessel upgrades was 

<<<

$7.7 million for seven vessels in 2008, $8.0 million for five vessels in 2007 and $7.1 million for three vessels in 2006. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful life o f the respective vessels.
Critical accounting policies

<<<


Basis o f accounting
The discussion and analysis o f our financial condition and results o f operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

<<<

 in the United Stales o f America or U S GAAP. The preparation o f those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount o f assets and liabilities, revenues aud expenses and related disclosure

<<<

 o f contingent assets and liabilities at the date o f our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Critical accounting p olicies are those that reflect significant judgments

<<<

 or uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have described below what w c believe arc our most critical accounting policies that involve a high degree o f judgment

<<<

 aud the methods o f their application. For a description o f all o f our significant accounting policies, see NOTE 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue recognition, trade accounts receivable and concentration o f credit risk
Revenues

<<<

 from voyage and lime charters arc recognized in proportion to the charter-time elapsed during the reporting periods. Charter revenue received in advance is recorded as a liability until charter services are rendered.
Under a voyage charter

<<<

, the Company agrees to provide a vessel for the transport o f cargo between specific ports in return for the payment o f an agreed freight per ton o f cargo or an agreed lump sum amount. Voyage costs, such as canal and port charges aud bunker

<<<

 (fuel) expenses, are the Company's responsibility. V oyage revenues and voyage expenses include estimates for voyage charters in progress which are recognized on apcrcentage-of-com plelionbasis by prorating the estimated final voyage profit

<<<

 using the ratio o f voyage days completed through year end to the total voyage days.

Under a time charier, Ihc Company places a vessel at the disposal o f a charterer for a given period o f lime in return for the payment o f a specified rate

<<<

 per DW T capacity per month or a specified rate o f hire per day. Voyage costs are the responsibility o f the charterer. Revenue from time charters in progress is calculated using the daily charter hire rate, net o f brokerage commissions,

<<<

 multiplied by the number o f on-hire days through the year-end. Revenue recognized under long-term variable rate lime charters is equal to the average daily rate for the term o f the contract.
The Company's financial instruments that arc exposed

<<<

 to concentrations o f credit risk consist primarily o f cash equivalents, trade receivables and derivative contracts (interest rate swaps). The Company maintains its cash accounts with various high quality financial institutions in the United

<<<

 Stales, the United Kingdom and Norway. The Company performs periodic evaluations o fth e relative credit standing o f these financial institutions. A t various times throughout the year, the Company may maintain certain U .S. bank account balances

<<<

 in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company does not believe that significant concentration o f credit risk exists with respect to these cash equivalents.
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount

<<<

 and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate o f the total losses likely in its existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on historical write-off experience and patterns that have developed

<<<

 with respect to the type o f receivable and an analysis o f the collectibility o f current amounts. Past due balances that are not specifically reserved for are reviewed individually for collectibility. Specific accounts receivable invoices

<<<

 arc charged o ff against the allowance when the Company determines that collection is unlikely. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the long standing relationships with significant customers and their relative

<<<

 financial stability. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations o f its customers' financial condition and maintains allowances for potential credit losses when necessary. The Company docs not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure

<<<

 related to its customers.
Vessels, capital improvements and depreciation
V essels are staled at cost, which includes contract price, acquisition costs and significant capital expenditures made within nine months o f the date o f purchase. Depreciation

<<<

 is provided using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives o f the vessels, based ou cost less salvage value. The estimated useful lives used are 3 0 years from the date o f construction. When vessels arc sold, the

<<<

 cost and related accumulated depreciation are reversed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements o f Income.
Capital improvements to vessels made during special surveys are capitalized

<<<

 when incurred and amortized over the five year period until the next special survey. Capitalized costs for scheduled classification survey and related vessel upgrades are depreciated over the remaining useful life o f the respective vessels

<<<

. Conversion costs are capitalized and depreciated over the period remaining to 30 years.
Payments for special survey costs arc characterized as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements o f Cash Flows. Amortization o f special survey

<<<

 costs Is characterized as amortization o f deferred charges on the Consolidated Statements o f Income and o f Cash Flows.
Impairment oflong-livcd assets
The Company is required to review its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events

<<<

 or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount o f an asset may not be recoverable. Upon the occurrence o f an indicator o f impairment, long-lived assets arc measured for impairment when the estimate o f undiscounted future cash fiow s

<<<

 expected to be generated by the asset is less than its carryiug amount. Measurement o f the impairment loss is based ou the asset grouping and is calculated based upon comparison o f the fair value to the carrying value o f the asset grouping

<<<

.
Derivatives and hedging activities
The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with the provisions o f SFAS N o. 133, as amended, Accountingfo r Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, ("SFASNo. 133"). The Company uses derivative

<<<

 instruments to reduce market risks associated with its operations, principally changes in interest rates and changes in charter rates. Derivative iustrumeuts arc recorded as assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value.
Derivatives

<<<

 designated as cash flow hedges pursuant to SFAS N o. 133 are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded as a component o f accumulated other comprehensive income (equity). Derivatives that

<<<

 do not qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to SFAS N o. 133 are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded in operations.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In May 2008, the Financial Accounting

<<<

 Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement o f Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 162, The Hierarchy o f Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, ("SFAS No 162"). The Statement identified the sources o f accounting principles and the

<<<

 framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation o f financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Statement is effective 60 days following

<<<

 the SEC's approval o f the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to A U Section 411, "The Meaning o f Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles," W e do not anticipate the adoption o f SFAS N

<<<

 o. 162 to have a material impact on the Company's results o f operations or financial position.
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instmments and Hedging Activities, an amendment o f FASB Statement No

<<<

. )33 ("SFAS N o. 161"). SFAS No. 161 requires entities to provide greater transparency through additional disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted

 for under SFAS N o. 133, Accounting fo r Derivative Instownents and Hedging Activities, and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, results o f operations

<<<

, and cash fiows. SFAS No. ! 61 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact o f adopting SFAS No. 161 on the Company

<<<

's disclosures o f its derivative instruments and hedging activities.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (revised 2007), ("SFAS No.l41(R)"}. SFAS No. 141 (R)amends SFA SNo. 141, Business Combinations, and

<<<

 provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, aud any lioncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also provides disclosure requirements to enable users o f the financial

<<<

 statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects o f the business combination. SFAS N o. 141 (R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is to be applied prospectively. Wc do not anticipate the adoption o

<<<

 f SFAS N o. 141 (R) to have a material impact on the Company's results o f operations or financial position.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment o fARB

<<<

 51, ("SFAS No. 160"), which establishes accounting and reporting standards pertaining to ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount o f net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling

<<<

 interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest, aud the valuation o f any retained noncontrolling equity investment when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS N o. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish

<<<

 between the interests o f the parent and the interests o f the noncontrolling owners. SFAS N o. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not anticipate the adoption o f SFAS No. 160 to have a material

 arrangements
The Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage interest costs and the risk associated with increases in variable interest rates. A s o f December 31, 2008, the Company had interest rate swaps having an aggregate

<<<

 notional amount o f $83.0 milliou designed to hedge debt tranches within a range o f 4.76% to 5.07%, expiring from December 2010 to December 2013. The Company pays fixed-rale interest amounts and receives floating rate interest amounts based

Item 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate

<<<

 their fair value due to the short-term maturities. The carrying amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for long-term debt approximates its fair value due to variable interest rates, which approximate market rates.
Credit Risk. The

<<<

 Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations o f credit risk consist primarily o f cash equivalents, trade receivables and derivative contracts (interest rate swaps). The Company maintains its cash accounts with various

<<<

 major financial institutions in the United Slates, the United Kingdom and Norway. The Company performs periodic evaluations o f the relative credit standing o f these financial institutions and limits the amount o f credit exposure with any

<<<

 one institution. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event o f non-performance by counter parties to derivative instruments; however, the Company limits its exposure by diversifying among counter parties with high credit ratings.
Due

<<<

 to the long standing relationships with significant customers, their relative financial stability, and the fact that customers generally pay in advance, credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited. The Company performs

<<<

 ongoing credit evaluations o f its customers' financial condition and maintains allowances for potential credit losses.
At December 31, 2008, the Company's largest five accounts receivable represented 92% o f total accounts receivable. At December

<<<

 31, 2007, the Company's largest five accounts receivable balances represented 86% o f total accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $253,000 and $336,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. To date, the Company

<<<

's actual losses on past due receivables have not exceeded our estimate o f bad debts.
Interest Rate Fluctuation. The Company's debt contains interest rates that fluctuate with LIBOR. Increasing interest rales could adversely impact future earnings

<<<

. The Company does not expect this rate to fluctuate dramatically, however slight increases can be expected. The Company does not expect rate changes to have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and capital resources due to the mitigation

<<<

 o f such risk resulting from interest rale swaps. The Company is party to interest swap agreements where it receives a floating interest rate and in exchange pays a fixed interest rate for a certain period. Contracts which meet the strict criteria

<<<

 for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges. A cash flow hedge is a hedge o f the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable

<<<

 forecasted transaction that could affect profit or loss. The effective portion o f the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly as a component o f Other comprehensive income in equity, w hile the ineffective portion, if

<<<

 any, is recognized immediately in current period earnings.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. The Company generates all o f its revenues in U.S. dollars but the Company incurs a portion o f its expenses in currencies other than U .S. dollars. For

<<<

 accounting purposes, expenses incurred in foreign currencies arc translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the date o f transaction. Resulting exchange gains and/or losses on settlement or translation are included in the

<<<

 accompanying Consolidated Statements o f Income.
Inflation. Although inflation has had a moderate impact on its trading fleet's operating and voyage expenses in recent years, management docs not consider inflation to be a significant risk to

<<<

 operating or voyage costs in the current economic environment. However, in the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the global economy, inflationary pressures would result in increased operating, voyage and financing costs.

<<<


Asset/Liability Risk Management. The Company continuously measures and quantifies interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, in each case taking into account the effect o f hedging activity. The Company uses derivatives as part o f its asset

<<<

/liability management program in order to reduce interest rate exposure arising from changes in interest rates. The Company

does not use derivative financial instruments for the purpose o f generating earnings from changes in market conditions

<<<

 or for speculative purposes. Before entering into a derivative transaction, the Company determines that there is a high correlation between the change in value of, or the cash Hows associated with, the hedged asset or liability and the value

<<<

 of, or the cash flows associated with, the derivative instrument.

Item 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Section 801 o f the N YSE American Stock Exchange Company Guide has

<<<

 established specific exemptions from its listing standards for controlled companies, i.e., companies o f which more than 50% o f the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another entity. The Company is a "controlled company" by

<<<

 virtue o f the fact that Michael S. Hudner, Trevor Williams andR. Anthony Dalzcll, each an officer and a director o f the Company, jointly control a majority interest in the stock o f the Company. Messrs. Hudner and Williams, together with

<<<

 certain other entities, have filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC on March 20, 2007, affirming that as members o f a group they share voting power o f over 50.5% o f the Company's outstanding voting slock. Mr. Dalzcll and an affiliated entity

<<<

 have agreed to cause their beneficially owned shares to be voted with Messrs. Hudner and Williams. Please see Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions.

The Company has elected to rely upon certain o f the exemptions provided

<<<

 in Part 8 o f the NYSE American Stock Exchange Company Guide. Specifically, the Company will rely on exceptions to the requirements that listed companies (i) have a majority o f independent directors, (ii) select, or recommend for the Board

<<<

's selection, director nominees by a majority of independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely o f independent directors, and (iii) determine officer compensation by a majority o f independent directors or a compensation committee

<<<

 comprised solely o f independent directors. Notwithstanding the above, the Company's current practices include (i) selecting director nominees by the full Board o f Directors, and (ii) determining officer compensation by a majority o f independent

<<<

 directors.

To the Board o f Directors and Shareholders o f B+H Ocean Carriers Ltd.
We have audited the accompanying

<<<

 consolidated balance sheets o f B+H Ocean Carriers Ltd. as o f December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements o f income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each o f the three years in the period ended December 3

<<<

 1, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility o f the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards

<<<

 o f the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United Slates). Those standards require that w e plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free o f material misstatement. We were

<<<

 not engaged to perform an audit o f the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration o f internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the

<<<

 circumstances, but not for the purpose o f expressing an opinion on the effectiveness o f the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, w e express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,

<<<

 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. W e believe that

<<<

 our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position o f B+H Ocean Carriers Ltd. at December 31, 200

<<<

8 and 2007 and the consolidated results o f its operations and its cash flow s for the each o f the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U .S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The accompanying consolidated

<<<

 financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 3, the Company's inability to comply with financial covenants under its current loan agreements as o f December

<<<

 31, 2008, its negative working capital position, and other matters discussed in Note 3 raise substantial doubt about the Com pany's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regards to these matters also arc described in

<<<

 Note 3. The December 31, 2008 consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification o f assets or the amounts and classification o f liabilities that

NOTE 1

<<<

 - ORGANIZATION
B+H Ocean Carriers Ltd. (the "Company"), a Liberian Corporation, was incorporated in April 1988 and was initially capitalized on June 27, 1988. The Company is engaged in the business o f acquiring, investing in, owning, operating

<<<

 and selling product tankers, OBO (Orc/Bulk/Oil), an Accommodation Field Development Vessel ("AFDV") and bulk carriers. In August 1988, the Company completed a public offering o f 4,000,000 shares o f its common stock. In M ay 2005, the Company

<<<

 made a private offering o f 3,243,243 shares o f its common stock.
A s o f December 31, 2008, the Company owned and operated four medium range and one panamax product tankers, five OBO (Ore/Bulk/Oil) combination carriers and three bulk carriers

<<<

. Through its subsidiary, Straits Offshore Ltd, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase an Accommodation Field Development V essel which was under construction in Malaysia and due to be delivered to the Company in first quarter 20

<<<

10. The Company also owns a 50% interest in the disponent owner o f a combination carrier through its interest in Nordan OBO 2 Inc ("Nordan"), which was acquired in March 2006. The Company accounts for its interest in Nordan under the equity

<<<

 method. A s o f December 31, 2007, the Company owned and operated seven medium range and two panamax product tankers and six combination carriers.
NOTE 2 ~ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis o f accounting:
The accompanying Consolidated

<<<

 Financial Statements are prepared on the accrual basis o f accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Slates o f America. A summary o f significant accounting policies follows.
Principles o f consolidation

<<<

:
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts o f the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Cliaship Holdings Ltd. ("Cliaship"), OBO Holdings Ltd. ("OBO Holdings"), Product Transport Corporation Ltd

<<<

. ("Protraus"), Boss Tankers, Ltd. ("B o ss"), Seasak Holdings Ltd. ("Seasak") and Straits Offshore Ltd. ("Straits"). Additionally, the consolidated financial statements reflect the Company's equity investment and related earnings associated

<<<

 with Nordan. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current period presentation.
Revenue recognition

<<<

, trade accounts receivable and concentration o f credit risk:
Under a voyage charter, the Company agrees to provide a vessel for the transport o f cargo between specific ports in return for the payment o f an agreed freight per ton o f cargo

<<<

 or an agreed lump sum amount. V oyage costs, such as canal and port charges and bunker (fuel) expenses, are the Company's responsibility. Voyage revenues include estimates for voyage charters in progress which arc recognized on a percenlage

<<<

-of-completion basis using the ratio o f voyage days completed through year end to the total voyage days.
Under a time charter, the Company places a vessel at the disposal o f a charterer for a given period o f time in return for the payment

<<<

 o f a specified rate o f hire per day. Voyage costs are the responsibility o f the charterer. Revenue from time charters in progress is calculated using the daily charier hire rate, net o f brokerage commissions, multiplied b y the number o

<<<

 f on-hire days through year-end. Revenue recognized under long-term variable rate lime charters is equal to the average daily rale for the term o f the contract.
The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations o f credit

<<<

 risk consist primarily o f cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company maintains its cash accounts with various high quality financial institutions mainly in the United Kingdom and Norway. The Company performs periodic evaluations o

<<<

 f the relative credit standing o f these financial institutions. The Company does not believe that significant concentration o f credit risk exists with respect to these cash equivalents.
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced

<<<

 amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate o f the total losses likely in its existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on historical write-off experience and patterns that

<<<

 have developed with respect to the type o f receivable and the analysis o f collectibility o f current amounts. Past due balances are reviewed individually for collectibility. Specific accounts receivable invoices are charged o ff against the

<<<

 allowance when the Company determines that collection is unlikely. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the long standing relationships with significant customers and their relative financial stability. The

<<<

 Company performs ongoing credit evaluations o f its customers' financial condition and maintains allowances for potential credit losses when necessary. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers

<<<

.
At December 31, 2008, the Company's largest five accounts receivable balances represented 92% o f total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2007, the Company's largest five accounts receivable balances represented 86% o f total accounts receivable

<<<

. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $253,000 and $336,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. To dale, the Company's actual losses on past due receivables have not exceeded its estimate o f bad debts.
During 200

<<<

8, revenues from one customer accounted for $34.5 million (33.1%) o f total revenues. Revenue from one customer accounted for $35.6 m illion (31.6%) o f total revenues in 2007. In 2006, revenue from one customer accounted for $32.9 million 

<<<

(34.0%) o f total revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, revenues from three significant customers accounted for $53.4 million (51.4%), $23.9 million (32.0%) and $ 13.5 million (18.1 %) o f total revenues, respectively

<<<

.
Basic and diluted net income per common share:
Basic net income per comm on share is computed by dividing the net income for the year by the weighted average number o f common shares outstanding in accordance with Statement o f Financial Accounting

<<<

 Standards (" SFAS") No. 128 ("SFAS No. 128"), Earnings per Share. Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated by dividing net income for the year by the weighted average number o f common shares, increased by potentially dilutive securities

<<<

. Diluted EPS reflects the net effect on shares outstanding, using the treasury stock method, o f the stock options granted to BHM in 2000 and the treasury shares held to satisfy the 1998 agreement discussed in NOTE 5.

Cash and cash equivalents:
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, certain money market accounts and overnight deposits with an original maturity o f 90 days or less when acquired.
M arketable Securities:
Marketable

<<<

 equity securities are recorded at fair value determined on the basis o f quoted market price. Such investments arc classified as trading securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting For Investments In Debt And Equity Securities (

<<<

"SFAS No. 115"). Changes in the fair value o f such investments arc recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statements o f Income.
Fair value o f financial instruments:
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair

<<<

 value o f financial instruments included in the following categories:
The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximate their fair values due to the

<<<

 current maturities o f such instruments.
The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets for short-term debt approximates its fair value due to the current maturity o f such instruments coupled with interest at

<<<

 variable rates that are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in overall market rates. The carrying amount o f the Company's variable rate long-term debt approximates fair value.
Vessels, capital improvements and depreciation:
V essels are

<<<

 slated at cost, which includes contract price, acquisition costs and significant capital expenditures made within nine months o f the date o f purchase. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful

<<<

 lives o f the vessels, based on cost less salvage value. The estimated useful lives used are 30 years from the date of construction. When vessels are sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts, and

<<<

 any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements o f Income.
Capital improvements to vessels made during special surveys are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the 5-ycar period until the next special

<<<

 survey. The capitalized costs for scheduled classification survey and related vessel upgrades were $7.7 million for five vessels in 2008, $8.0 million for three vessels in 2007 and $7.1 million in 2006 for two vessels. Three special surveys

<<<

 were in process at December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 . Conversion costs are capitalized and will be amortized over the period remaining to 30 years.
Payments for special survey costs are characterized as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements

<<<

 o f Cash Flows. Amortization o f special survey costs is characterized as amortization o f deferred charges on the Consolidated Statements o f Income and Cash Flows.
Repairs and maintenance:
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance and interim

<<<

 drydocking o f vessels are charged against income in the year incurred. Repairs and maintenance expense approximated $4.3 million,$2.2 million and SI.9 million for the years ended December 3 1,2008,2007 and 2006, respectively. Interim drydocking

<<<

 expense was approximately SI.9 million, S0.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31,2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Impairment of long-lived assets:
The Company is required to review its long-lived assets for impairment

<<<

 whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount o f an asset m ay not be recoverable. Upon the occurrence o f an indicator o f impairment, long-lived assets are measured for impairment when the estimate o f undiscounted future

<<<

 cash flow s expected to be generated by the asset is less than its carrying amount. Measurement o f the impairment loss is based on the asset grouping and is calculated based upon comparison o f the fair value to the carrying value o f the

<<<

 asset grouping. During the 3rd quarter o f 2008, the Company recorded an impairment charge o f $7.4 related to the M /V Algonquin.
As a result o f this impairment charge and the decline in dry bulk carrier lime charter rales, the Company determined

<<<

 that an indicator o f impairment existed with respect to its dry bulk carriers. Accordingly, the Company performed an impairment analysis on those two vessels. N o indicators o f impairment were present related to the other vessels in the Company

<<<

's fleet. The Company compared the undiscounted cash flow s to the carrying values for each bulk carrier to determine i f the vessels were recoverable. The analysis was performed using historical average time charter rates as well as management

<<<

's estimation and judgment in forecasting future rates and operating results. These estimates are consistent with the plans and forecasts used by management to conduct its business. The analysis indicated that the carrying value o f the vessels

<<<

 was recoverable.
Scgracnt Rep orting:
The Company has determined that it operates in one reportable segment, the international transport o f dry bulk and liquid cargo.
Inventories:
Inventories consist o f engine and machinery lubricants and

<<<

 bunkers (fuel) required for the operation and maintenance o f each vessel. Inventories are valued at cost, using the first-in, first-out method. Expenditures on other consumables arc charged against income when incurred.
Taxation:
The Company

<<<

 is not subject to corporate income taxes on its profits in Liberia because its income is derived from non-Liberian sources. The Company is not subject to corporate income lax in otherjurisdictions.
Derivatives and hedging activities:
The Company

<<<

 accounts for derivatives in accordance with the provisions o f SFAS N o. 133, as amended, Accountingfo r Derivative Instruments andHedging Activities, ("SFAS No. 133"). The Company uses derivative instruments to reduce market risks associated

<<<

 with its operations, principally changes in interest rates and changes in charter rates. Derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities and arc measured at fair value.
Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges pursuant to SFAS

<<<

 N o. 133 arc recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded as a component o f accumulated other comprehensive income (equity). At December 31, 2008, the Company is party to four interest rate

<<<

 swap agreements that qualify as cash flow hedges; the äggregale fair value o f these cash flow hedges is a liability o f $4.4 million. A t December 31, 2007, the Company was party to three interest rate swap agreements that qualified as cash

<<<

 flow hedges; the aggregate fair value o f these cash flow hedges was a liability o f $0.8 million.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to SFAS N o. 133 arc recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with the corresponding

<<<

 changes in fair value recorded in operations. A t December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 , the Company is party to one interest rate swap agreement having an aggregate notional value o f $8.8 million, which does not qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to

<<<

 SFAS No. 133. This swap agreement was entered into to hedge debt tranches o f 4.96%, expiring in December 2010. The fair value o f this lion-qualifying swap agreement is a liability o f $0.5 million. At December 31, 2007, the Company was party

<<<

 to two interest rate swap agreements which did not qualify for hedge accounting. The aggregate fair value o f these non qualifying swap agreements was a liability o f $0.9 million. These are both reflected within Fair Value o f Derivative Instruments

<<<

 on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recorded as Gain (Loss) on value o f interest rate swaps in the Consolidated Statements o f Income.
Additionally, at December 3 1,2 0 0 7 , the Company was party to put option agreements

<<<

 which are designed to mitigate the risk associated with changes in charter rates. These put option agreements, which were entered into during 2007 and 2006, did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS N o. 133; and the changes in their

<<<

 fair value are therefore recorded in Gain (Loss) on fair value o f derivatives on the Income Statement. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate fair value o f these non-qualifying put options was $7.3 million (favorable to the company) and was

<<<

 reflected within Fair Value o f Derivative Instruments on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The put option contracts were sold or settled during 2008. The aggregate realized gain on the sale o f contracts totaled $16.1 million for

 3 - GOING CONCERN
As o f December 3 1 ,2008 , the Company was not in compliance with a particular covenant contained in four loan agreements relating to $114 m illion o f the Company's debt. The covenant requires that Total Value Adjusted Equity

<<<

 (as defined in the respective loan agreements) should represent not less than 30% o f Total Value Adjusted Assets (as defined) (the "VAE Ratio"). At December 31, 2008, the actual ratio w as 28.5% or 1.5% below the minimum requirement. Although

<<<

 the banks concerned have advised the Company by e-mail in each case that a waiver has been approved, which the Company b elieves on advice o f counsel is binding, the Company is seeking to confirm the waivers in definitive written agreements

<<<

. The Company does not expect that it will be able to meet all financial covenants o f these four loan agreements and certain o f its other credit facilities in periods subsequent to December 3 1 ,2 0 0 8 in the absence o f further agreements

<<<

 with its lenders, especially if current market conditions continue. Accordingly, the Company is currently in negotiations with its lenders to obtain waivers o f future potential technical breaches o f covenants and restructure the loans. Until

<<<

 and unless these potential technical defaults are waived, the lenders have the right to cancel the commitment and demand repayment. Management expects that lenders will not demand repayment o f the loans before their maturity, provided the

<<<

 Company pays loan installments and accrued interest on their scheduled basis. Notwithstanding the waivers o f the VA E Ratio defaults on the four loan agreements referred to above, the Company has reclassified its long term debt under those

<<<

 loan agreements, amounting to $77.8 m illion, as current as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition to the potential future technical defaults on other financial covenants which affect m ost o f the Company

<<<

's credit facilities, this reclassification triggers the cross default or material adverse change clauses in the remaining outstanding debt. The Company, therefore, has reclassified the remaining $48.9 m illion o f long term debt to current

<<<

.
While management expects to be able to service all o f its loans in accordance with current loan agreements, management docs not expect that cash generated from current operations would be sufficient to repay the balance should the lenders

<<<

 demand total repayment. In addition, the Company may seek to raise additional liquidity from other strategic alternatives. However, there can be no assurances that these efforts to restructure the loans or raise additional liquidity will be

<<<

 successful. In connection with any waiver or amendment to the Company's credit facilities, its lenders may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on it or modify the terms o f its credit facility. These restrictions may limit

<<<

 the Company's ability to, among other things, pay dividends in the future, make capital expenditures or incur additional indebtedness, including through the issuance o f guarantees. In addition, its lenders may require the payment o f

additional

<<<

 fees, require prepayment o f a portion o f its indebtedness to them, accelerate the amortization schedule for its indebtedness and increase the interest rates they charge it on its outstanding indebtedness.
The consolidated financial statements

<<<

 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification o f recorded asset amounts, the amounts and classification

<<<

 o f liabilities, or any other adjustments that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, other than the current classification o f debt discussed in N ote 7.
