<<<

 amount outstanding of SEK 250,000,000) (the "Bonds") issued by TradeDoubler AB (publ) (the "Issuer"). In its capacity as Agent, and as requested by the Issuer, the Agent hereby initiates a procedure in writing (the "Written Procedure") as required

<<<

 by the Terms and Conditions (as defined below), whereby Holders can vote for or against the Issuer's requests.
All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this notice (the "Notice") shall have the meanings assigned to them

<<<

 in the terms and conditions of the Bonds (the "Terms and Conditions").
Holders participate by completing and sending the voting form, attached hereto as Schedule 1 (the "Voting Form"), and, if applicable, the power of attorney/authorisation

<<<

, attached hereto as Schedule 2 (the "Power of Attorney") or other sufficient evidence, if the Bonds are held in custody other than by the CSD, to the Agent. Please contact the securities firm you hold your Bonds through if you do not know how

<<<

The Agent must receive the Voting Form no later than 17.00 CET on 23 April 2018 either by mail, courier or email to the Agent using the contact details

To be eligible to participate in the Written Procedure, a person must meet the criteria for being a Holder on 9 April 2018 (the "Record

Disclaimer

<<<

: The Request (as defined below) is presented to the Holders as requested by the Issuer and as required by the Terms and Conditions, without any evaluation, advice or recommendations from the Agent whatsoever. The Agent has not reviewed or assessed

<<<

 this Notice or the Request (and its effects, should it be adopted) from a legal or commercial perspective of the Holders and the Agent expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to the content o f this Notice and the content and an

<<<

 eventual execution o f the Request (and its effects, should it be adopted). The Holders are recommended to seek legal advice in order to independently evaluate whether the Request (and its effects) is acceptable or not. For the avoidance o

<<<

 f doubt, the Agent is not responsible neither involved in the Tender Offer (as defined below).
1. Background
The Bonds will mature on 20 December 2018 and the Issuer is therefore currently evaluating different alternatives in order to refinance

<<<

 the Bonds. In order to increase the financial flexibility for the Issuer to refinance the Bonds, it is proposed that the Holders approve to amend the Terms and Conditions in order to inter alia enable the incurrence of, secured or unsecured

<<<

, additional debt in an amount of SEK 100,000,000.
Moreover, in order to improve its financial results and to obtain control of its financing costs, the Issuer has initiated an offer to purchase Bonds from the Holders for a cash consideration

<<<

 equalling 75.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount of the Bonds together with accrued but unpaid interest, i.e. a purchase price which is equal to one of the most recent trading prices on the market. In order to further increase the Holders' incentive

<<<

 to tender Bonds in the offer, the Issuer offers an additional early bird fee equalling 2.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount per Bond to each Holder tendering Bonds, or irrevocably undertaking to tender Bonds, before 17.00 CET on 5 April 20

<<<

18. This offer is however conditional upon that the Holders approve the request set out in this Notice.
In this Notice, it is further proposed that the Holders approve to amend the Terms and Conditions in order to include a possibility for the

<<<

 Issuer to, at any day up to and including the Final Maturity Date, redeem the Bonds at a price of 75.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid interest.
Provided that the proposed amendments are approved by a requisite

<<<

 majority, all Holders voting in favour of the amendments will receive a consent fee in an amount equal to 10.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount per Bond which such Holder has used to vote in favour of the Request.
Please note that Holders can

<<<

 vote either in this Written Procedure or in the separate tender offer voting procedure, which is described in brief below in Section 2. Should a Holder submit votes both through this Written Procedure and through the tender offer voting process

<<<

, the vote submitted through the tender offer voting process will prevail.
2. The separate Tender Offer voting procedure
As a separate process and as announced by way of a press release on 26 March 2018, the Issuer has initiated an offer to

<<<

 purchase Bonds from the Holders for a cash consideration equalling 75.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount of the Bonds together with accrued but unpaid interest (the "Tender Offer"). Detailed information about the Tender Offer and how to tender

<<<

 Bonds is set forth in a tender offer notice which was distributed to the Holders together with this Notice (the "Tender Offer Notice").

Holders who wish to tender Bonds must, instead of voting in this Written Procedure, deliver a "Tender

<<<

 and Voting Instruction" (a separate appendix to the Tender Offer Notice) before 17.00 CET on 19 April 2018 (the "Tender Offer Deadline") in accordance with the instructions set out in the Tender Offer Notice. Such Tender and Voting Instruction

<<<

 needs to include an instruction to vote in favour of the Request (as defined in Section 4 below) set out in this Notice.

Holders submitting a "Tender and Voting Instruction", and Holders or beneficial owners of Bonds who have entered into

<<<

 an Irrevocable Undertaking (as defined below), before 17.00 CET on 5 April 2018 will receive an additional premium of 2.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount of the Bonds (the "Early Bird Fee"). All Holders tendering Bonds in the Tender Offer

<<<

 will also receive a consent fee in an amount equal to 10.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount per Bond voted in favour with in accordance with Section 5 (Consent Fee) below.

The Tender Offer, the consent fee and the Early Bird Fee are conditional

<<<

 upon that the Holders approve the Request (as defined in Section 4 below) set out in this Notice.

The Issuer has already received irrevocable undertakings to participate in the Tender Offer and to vote in favour of the Request (as defined

<<<

 in Section 4 below) from certain key Holders and beneficial owners of Bonds (each an "Irrevocable Undertaking").

Holders should note that the Tender Offer is a separate process. The Agent does not administer the Tender Offer and is not involved

<<<

 in or in any way responsible for the Tender Offer.

<<<

 or email to the address indicated below no later than 17.00 CET, on 23 April 2018. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.

<<<

When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent, the Request shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has

<<<

 not yet expired.
Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure will: i) be sent by notice to the Holders and ii) be published on the websites of a) the Issuer and b) the Agent.
A matter decided under the Written Procedure

<<<

 will be binding for all Holders, irrespective of them responding in the Written Procedure.

<<<

 voting process will prevail.
7.3 Voting rights and authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (9 April 2018) in the debt register:
(a) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities

<<<

 Account; or
(b) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.
7.4 Bonds registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a

<<<

 registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its

<<<

 own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries

<<<

, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as holder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered

<<<

 in the debt register as a Holder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.

Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other

<<<

 intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you

<<<

 wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting

<<<

 rights.

To approve the Request, Holders representing at least twenty (20.00) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the Request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.
If a quorum does not exist, the

7.6 Majority

<<<

 Nominal Amount for which Holders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to the Request.
7.7 Address for sending replies
