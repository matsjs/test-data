RISK FACTORS

<<<


Any investment in the Notes is subject to a number of risks. Prior to investing in the Notes, prospective investors should carefully consider risk factors associated with any investment in the Notes, the business of the Issuer and the industry

<<<

 in which it operates together with all other information contained in this Prospectus, including, in particular the risk factors described below. Words and expressions defined in the Conditions or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same

<<<

 meanings in this section.
The following is not an exhaustive list or explanation of all risks which investors may face when making an investment in the Notes and should be used as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties relating to

<<<

 the Issuer that are not currently known to the Issuer, or that it currently deems immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects, results of operations and/or financial position of

<<<

 the Issuer and, if any such risk should occur, the price of the Notes may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable for them in light

<<<

 of the information in this Prospectus and their personal circumstances.
Capitalised terms which are defined in the Conditions have the same meaning when used herein.
Risks relating to the Issuer
Set out below is a brief description of certain

<<<

 factors which may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes:
The Issuer is a holding company and is dependent upon its subsidiaries
The Issuer is a holding company and carries out its business

<<<

 through its subsidiaries (together with the Issuer, the "If Group" or "If"). Accordingly, the Issuer is dependent upon receipt of funds from other members of the If Group in order to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes

<<<

. Accordingly, material adverse events affecting the If Group's business and financial conditions may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.
The If Group is impacted

<<<

 by macro economic development and changes in general economic conditions
Macro economic development in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and the Baltic countries may impact on the If Group's business in that underwriting volumes as well as underwriting

<<<

 risks are affected by various factors such as GDP growth, unemployment, new car sales volumes and unexpected changes in inflation rate. In some lines, such as business interruption and cargo insurances, the insured volume is dependent upon

<<<

 factors such as turnover or the amount of transported goods. Thus, a general decrease in corporate turnover or a decrease in the amount of transported goods following a fall in GDP or a slowing in GDP growth will have an adverse effect on the

<<<

 If Group's insurance premium volumes. Similarly, a lower new car sales volume would affect premium volumes in the motor segment and a higher unemployment rate would affect workers' compensation premiums.
In the event of unexpected changes in

<<<

 the inflation rate, the business and financial performance and results of operations of the If Group could be adversely affected due to deviations in cost of claims from expected levels.
Over the last couple of years, the If Group has operated

<<<

 in an environment of significant volatility in global capital and equity markets, oil prices and liquidity, and widespread economic uncertainty. Government interest rates and oil prices remain at historically low levels. Although the If Group

<<<

 has a diversified investment portfolio and constantly monitors and manages the composition of its investments in relation to the characteristics of its insurance liabilities, fluctuations in the financial markets, such as the fixed income,

<<<

 equity and currency markets, could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under or in connection

<<<

 with the Notes.
- 4-

Competitive conditions could affect the If Group's results
The If Group conducts insurance operations in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and the Baltic countries. The five largest insurers (of which the If Group is the

<<<

 largest) comprise more than half of the Nordic property and casualty ("P&C") insurance market (measured by gross written premiums) and four of the five largest insurers are established in more than one Nordic country. Competition in the Nordic

<<<

 insurance market has been intense in recent years. The market has seen leading foreign insurers establishing themselves primarily within the industrial sector along with banks expanding their P&C insurance product range. Competitive pressure

<<<

 has also come from new sources such as smaller competitors and competition from new distribution channels such as web-based service models. Increased competition from such insurers could lead to a reduction in market share, which may have a

<<<

 material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.
The If Group is

<<<

 subject to insurance risk
Insurance risk is the risk that the cost of future and outstanding insurance claims will be higher than anticipated due to inadequate pricing, risk concentration, incorrect assumptions or random fluctuations in the

<<<

 frequency and/or size of claims. The If Group's insurance operations are exposed to the risk of unexpected changes in the frequency and severity of claims and timing in claims payments. The extent of this risk is largely dependent on the type

<<<

 of product and business. For example, the casualty business is exposed to medical and healthcare costs as well as legislative changes in respect of injury compensation, whilst property and motor hull insurance is sensitive to building cost

<<<

 inflation and prices of spare parts and repair cost. Claim frequency can fluctuate heavily over time. High economic activity usually correlates with a higher number of claims, while restrictions in terms and conditions and changes in legislation

<<<

 may serve to increase or decrease claims frequencies. Winter weather and cold periods traditionally increase the number of property and motor claims. Changes in interest rates might impact the value of discounted reserves (mainly annuities

<<<

 in the If Group's IFRS accounts) and thus have an effect on the financial result.
Changes in interest rates further affect the value of technical provisions and own funds in the regulatory solvency calculations for Solvency II. Under Solvency

<<<

 II, all balance sheet items are measured at fair value. The market value of technical provisions is equal to the sum of a best estimate and a risk margin. The best estimate is derived by discounting the undiscounted best estimate of the premium

<<<

 and claims provisions and the risk margin is calculated with a cost of capital method. The undiscounted best estimate of premium provisions is computed as the expected future cash flows arising from future claims events, expenses and premiums

<<<

 covered by existing insurance obligations. For claims provisions, a cash flow profile of the estimated future payments by relevant homogeneous risk groups is estimated using actuarial reserving methods, taking all relevant cash inflows and

<<<

 outflows into account. Discounting of the cash flows is performed using discount curves that are derived consistently with the principles for the risk-free interest rate curve under Solvency II. Consequently, when market interest rates decrease

<<<

, the technical provisions in the Solvency II balance sheet increase and own funds decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on the If Group's financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil

<<<

 its obligations under or in connection with the Notes. Conversely, when market interest rates increase, the technical provisions in the Solvency II balance sheet decrease and own funds increase.
Insurance risk can be divided into underwriting

<<<

 risk, provision risk, emerging risk, catastrophe risk and reinsurance risk:
Underwriting risk
Underwriting risk is the risk of losses due to inadequate pricing of insurance contracts. The If Group's pricing models generally build on statistical

<<<

 evaluations and actuarial methods. Should the pricing models incorporate inaccurate methods (for example due to poor or incorrect data) and / or the pricing process fail to capture unexpected developments in claims costs, this could have an

<<<

 adverse effect on the financial position of the If Group. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.
- 5-

Provision risk

Provision risk is the risk of loss

<<<

 due to the technical provisions not being sufficient to cover the cost of claims (e.g. due to higher inflation than expected) from insurance business already written (see "Description of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and the Sampo Group Technical

<<<

 provisions (Reserves)"). The level of provisions deemed to be sufficient is established by use of relevant actuarial methods that reflect assumptions and empirical outcomes. The If Group continuously monitors the adequacy of technical provisions

<<<

 and makes necessary adjustments as soon as new information is available. Unexpected increases in the cost of claims when measured against the level of provisions may occur nonetheless, for example due to the appearance of risks that have not

<<<

 yet been recognised or because the methods used for setting provisions prove to be inaccurate, which might have an adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact

<<<

 the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.
Emerging risk

The If Group is also subject to emerging insurance risks. By their very nature these risks are evolving, uncertain and difficult to quantify

<<<

. Potential emerging risk exposures include, for example, areas such as nanotechnology and the environmental impact of climate change (for example, destruction caused to property by events such as flooding). Due to the difficulty in predicting

<<<

 these risks, potential emerging insurance risks could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations

<<<

 under or in connection with the Notes.
Catastrophe risk

Catastrophe risk (the risk of low frequency, high severity events that are often not captured adequately by the premium and reserve risk charge) is related to the type of events which

<<<

 could trigger multiple insured losses to property or to the person and thus might have a large financial impact on the If Group. Catastrophe risk can either result from natural catastrophes, for example windstorms, floods or other weather phenomena

<<<

 or man-made catastrophes such as acts of terrorism. Catastrophe risk is assessed at the If Group level and handled and mitigated through reinsurance protection in order to protect the If Group balance sheet from severe outcomes.

An unexpected

<<<

 increase in catastrophe claims could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in

<<<

 connection with the Notes.
Reinsurance risk

Reinsurance is utilised for the purpose of protecting the If Group's capital against adverse outcomes of large claims and event losses (including, but not limited to, catastrophe risk) and to achieve

<<<

 tolerable result volatility aligned with an established risk tolerance level.

External reinsurance programs are purchased annually on an If Group-wide basis. In order to ensure that no legal entity within the If Group has an excessive risk

<<<

 level, intra-group reinsurance arrangements are used.

The If Group has reinsurance programs in place for all major lines of business including a group wide event program. In addition there are separate reinsurance programs in place to cover

<<<

 specific risks, for example reinsurance for terrorism risks in the United States which is purchased due to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and related legislation.

The If Group's reinsurance protection is exposed to the following

<<<

 risks:



default of reinsurer(s) participating in the If Group's current or historic reinsurance program;



misinterpretation of reinsurance wording resulting in lack of cover for specific risks or exposures;



mismatch in the timing of

<<<

 payments of claims against collection of reinsurance recoveries;



claims outcome exceeding the amount of reinsurance capacity purchased; and

- 6-



reduced market capacity for certain risks or exposures, which makes it difficult to renew

<<<

 specific

programs.

A failure of, or deficiency in, the level of reinsurance cover could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability

<<<

 of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.

The If Group is subject to investment and other market related financial risks

Investment returns are an important part in determining the If Group's overall profitability

<<<

. Investment returns are susceptible to changes in general economic conditions, including changes affecting the general creditworthiness of the debt and equity securities held in the If Group's portfolios. The value of fixed income securities

<<<

 may be affected by, amongst other things, changes in the Issuer's creditworthiness. Where the creditworthiness of the issuer of a debt security worsens, the credit ratings of the security may change and the value of the security may decline

<<<

.
Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk refers to the uncertainty in the values of assets and liabilities as well as interest income and expenses resulting from changes in market interest rates. When market interest rates rise, the balance

<<<

 sheet values of fixed income securities fall and this has an immediate impact on the If Group's equity capital and earnings (however, it is possible to reduce and even eliminate these effects by using interest rate derivatives). On the other

<<<

 hand, higher interest rates mean increased interest income for new investments, which gradually improves profitability and the If Group's capital position.

When market interest rates decrease, the balance sheet values of fixed income securities

<<<

 rise and this has an immediate impact on the value of the If Group's investment portfolio. Conversely, consistently low market interest rates would result in a reduction in the return on the If Group's future fixed income investments. Generally

<<<

, investment income may be reduced during sustained periods of lower interest rates as higher yielding fixed income securities are called, mature or are sold and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates even though prices of fixed income securities

<<<

 tend to rise and gains realised upon their sale tend to increase at lower rates.
Credit spread volatility

The If Group's exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit

<<<

 spreads. A widening of credit spreads will generally reduce the value of fixed income securities that the If Group holds.
Equity risk

The If Group is exposed to changes in the prices of its equity portfolio, which consists mainly of Scandinavian

<<<

 equities and global funds, which are generally subject to greater volatility and hence risks than fixed income securities. The policy of the If Group is to have a diversified portfolio among industry sectors and geographic regions, although

<<<

 general economic conditions and many other factors beyond the control of the If Group can adversely affect the equity markets and hence the If Group. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under

<<<

 or in connection with the Notes.
Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that an insurance undertaking will be unable to realise investments and other assets in order to settle its financial obligations when they fall due. Liquidity risk

<<<

 can be divided into the refinancing risk of debt and the market liquidity risk of investments.



Market liquidity risk of investments

Market liquidity risk is the risk that insurance undertakings are unable to realise investments and other

<<<

 assets in order to settle their financial obligations when they fall due. Market liquidity risk is reduced by placing certain amounts of investment in instruments generally considered to be liquid or with short maturities. However, if the If

<<<

 Group faces large-scale demands requiring immediate realisation of liquid assets, this could have a material adverse effect on its business,

- 7-

results of operations or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability

<<<

 of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.



Refinancing risk of debt

Refinancing risk is the risk that the If Group could face increased costs in relation to refinancing its debt. The If Group's refinancing

<<<

 risk is related mainly to the credit rating of its debt. Should the credit rating of the If Group or any of its main operating companies drop to a level such that the investment guidelines or regulations applicable to key investors prohibit

<<<

 the holding of the If Group's securities, these investors might be forced to decrease their investments in the If Group, which, in turn, could lead to an increase in the cost of new funding or restrict the If Group's ability to obtain new funding

<<<

.
Currency risk

Currency risk refers to the sensitivity of the values of assets, liabilities and financial instruments to changes in the level or in the volatility of currency exchange rates.

Currency risk is part of the If Group's normal

<<<

 business activities and investment decisions. Currency risk occurs in insurance activities where most of the written insurance policies are denominated in Scandinavian currencies and in Euros. This currency risk is to a large extent reduced

<<<

 by matching the technical provisions with investment assets denominated in the corresponding currencies or by using currency derivatives. The currency exposure in insurance operations is hedged to the base currency on a frequent basis. The

<<<

 currency exposure in investment assets is controlled weekly and is hedged when the exposure reaches a specified level, which is set with respect to cost efficiency and minimum transaction size. Currency risk also arises in investment management

<<<

, where active currency positions are taken, (see "risks relating to the Notes generally ­ Exchange rate risks and exchange controls").

The If Group is also exposed to translation risk. Translation risk refers to currency risk that arises when

<<<

 consolidating the financial statements of foreign operations that have a different base currency from the Issuer's home jurisdiction into the If Group's financial statements. The major functional currencies are Euro, Norwegian kroner and Danish

<<<

 kroner. Since the If Group presents its consolidated financial statements in Swedish kronor, the If Group's consolidated balance sheet and income statement may be affected by exchange differences between the Swedish kronor and the functional

<<<

 currencies. The translation risk is not hedged.
Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise from a borrower, issuer of bonds or counterparty failing to make required payments. Credit risk is closely tied to the potential return

<<<

 of an investment in the sense that a higher potential return usually means a higher credit risk. The If Group is exposed to credit risk through, amongst other things, holdings of fixed income instruments, derivative contracts that are not cleared

<<<

 via a clearing house, reinsurance agreements and loan advances. A failure by an issuer of a security or of a counterparty to a derivative or reinsurance agreement to meet its obligations could have a material impact on the If Group's financial

<<<

 position. The counterparty risk in the If Group's investment portfolios mainly arises from financial institutions and corporations in the Nordic region. In addition, when it comes to credit risk, the If Group is exposed to concentration risk

<<<

, which is managed by taking into account the If Group's concentration exposure by industry sectors, products and creditworthiness when setting individual issuer-specific limits in the investment policy. The If Group's investments are also exposed

<<<

 to the spread risk which relates mainly to changes in the credit spreads of fixed income investments. Additionally, counterparty risk related to reinsurers arises through reinsurance receivables and through the reinsurers' portion of outstanding

<<<

 claims. The If Group has substantial exposure to reinsurers through reinsurance arrangements. Under such arrangements other insurers assume a portion of the costs, losses and expenses associated with policy claims and maturities, and reported

<<<

 and unreported losses, in exchange for a portion of the policy premiums. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on general market conditions and may vary significantly. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance cover purchased

<<<

 will increase the If Group's risk of loss. When reinsurance is obtained, the If Group is still liable for those transferred risks if the reinsurer does not meet its obligations. Therefore, the inability or failure of reinsurers to meet their

<<<

 financial obligations could materially affect the If Group's operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.

- 8-

Systemic

<<<

 risk

The If Group is exposed to systemic risk which is the risk whereby default by a financial institution, or general concerns as to its creditworthiness, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions

<<<

 because the stability of many financial institutions may be closely linked to credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between such financial institutions. Such liquidity problems may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as

<<<

 clearing houses, banks and securities firms with which the If Group interacts on a daily basis and, therefore, could adversely affect the If Group both directly and indirectly.
Asset Liability Management

Asset Liability Management ("ALM")

<<<

 risk is the risk of a change in value resulting from a deviation between assets and liability cash flows, prices or carrying amounts caused by a change in actual cash flows or a change in expectations of future cash flows. ALM risk is caused

<<<

 by differences in the sensitivity of investments and technical provisions to interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

The If Group's ALM risk is mainly attributable to the following:



discrepancies in the impact of fluctuations in the

<<<

 level of, or volatility of, interest rates on assets

and liabilities; and



discrepancies in currency exposure between assets and liabilities, causing sensitivity to currency

movements against Swedish kronor which might have an adverse financial

<<<

 impact.

The If Group is subject to operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, from human errors, or from external events. Each business area, as well as the corporate

<<<

 functions, of the If Group has responsibility for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing operational risks within its various units.

The If Group's business is dependent on processing a large number of complex transactions across

<<<

 numerous and diverse products. Systems and processes are designed to ensure that the operational risks associated with the If Group's activities are appropriately controlled, but a weakness in the systems could negatively impact its results

<<<

 of operations.

The If Group is also dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of its IT and telephone systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunication failure, negligence or similar misconduct

<<<

 or events beyond its control. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations

<<<

 under or in connection with the Notes.

The If Group is subject to reputational risk

The If Group is vulnerable to adverse market perception as it operates in a regulated industry where it must display a high level of integrity and maintain

<<<

 the trust and the confidence of customers. Reputational risks are related to the way the If Group is perceived from the perspective of different stakeholders (shareholders, customers, staff, business partners or the general public). Reputational

<<<

 risks may arise through external distribution channels, the behaviour of which could be difficult to control. Mismanagement, fraud or failure to satisfy regulatory responsibilities, which may result from actions and conduct of individual employees

<<<

 and thus may be difficult to control, and the resulting negative publicity from such activities could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations and/or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely

<<<

 impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.

The If Group is subject to litigation risk

There are a number of legal proceedings currently ongoing against the If Group, arising in the ordinary

<<<

 course of business. An unfavourable outcome of potential future litigation could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the

<<<

 Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.

- 9-

The If Group conducts its business subject to regulation and associated regulatory risks, including the effects of changes in the laws, regulations, policies and

<<<

 interpretations and any accounting standards in the markets in which it operates
Regulatory compliance and regulatory changes
Insurance is a highly regulated business with formal rules for minimum capital and capital structure and the If Group

<<<

's business is subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. Supervisory authorities have broad jurisdiction over many aspects of the If Group's business, which may include capital adequacy, marketing and selling

<<<

 practices, licences, policy terms and conditions, terms of business and permitted investments. The If Group believes that it complies with all current legal requirements. However, regulation in countries in which the If Group operates may change

<<<

, which could have a material adverse effect on the If Group's business, results of operations and/or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the

<<<

 Notes.
On the 1st of January 2016, the Solvency II Directive was implemented in each of the markets in which the If Group operates. Solvency II is a risk-based solvency regime, which aims to deepen the integration of the insurance and reinsurance

<<<

 market, enhance the protection of policyholders and beneficiaries, improve international competitiveness of EU insurers and reinsurers and promote better regulation. Compared with Solvency I, the regulatory capital requirements under Solvency

<<<

 II will more accurately reflect the specific risk profile of each undertaking.
Having prepared for the implementation of Solvency II over a number of years, the If Group believes that it is well poised to meet the challenges and opportunities

<<<

 presented in the new regulatory framework. However, while the aim of Solvency II is to introduce a harmonised, risk-based approach to solvency capital, there is a risk of differences in interpretation and a risk of a failure by financial supervisory

<<<

 authorities to align Solvency II approaches across Europe, resulting in an unequal competitive landscape. Compliance with the Solvency II requirements cannot be guaranteed and potential non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 the If Group's business, results of operations and/or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.
All financial services groups face the

<<<

 risk that regulators may find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required. Regulatory proceedings could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding

<<<

, the If Group, as well as diverting management's attention and resources away from the day-to-day management of the business. A significant regulatory action against the If Group could have a material adverse effect on the business of the If

<<<

 Group, its results of operations and/or financial condition. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.
In addition, changes in government policy, legislation

<<<

 or regulatory interpretation applying to the financial services industry in the markets in which the If Group operates may adversely affect its product range, distribution channels, capital requirements and, consequently, its results of operations

<<<

 and financing requirements.
Accounting compliance and risk from possible accounting changes
Financial statements presented for the Issuer are prepared in accordance with Swedish laws and regulations. The If Group has prepared the consolidated

<<<

 accounts in accordance with international accounting standards (IFRS including IAS, SIC and IFRIC), as adopted by the European Commission. In addition, the If Group applies the supplementary provisions ensuing from legislation, the Swedish

<<<

 Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and recommendations as well as appropriate parts of recommendations issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.
Issued, but not yet effective, international accounting standards are assessed

<<<

 as not causing any significant impact on the If Group's financial statements when first applied, except IFRS 9 Financial Instruments ("IFRS 9") which will be effective from 1 January 2018. However, the IASB has decided that insurance companies

<<<

 under certain circumstances can defer the first application of the standard until 2021 at the latest. The If Group would qualify for a deferral under the circumstances decided by the IASB. Neither IFRS 9 nor the exemption for insurance companies

<<<

 has been adopted for use in the EU. The If Group has
- 10-

initiated an assessment of the expected effects from making a transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 (as published by the IFRS). Under the new standard the classification and measurement

<<<

 of financial assets depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model used for managing the financial asset. This in turn determines whether the income from financial assets are recognised in the

<<<

 income statement at fair value, in other comprehensive income at fair value or accrued in accordance with an amortised cost measurement model. If the income from financial assets is not recognised in the income statement at fair value, then

<<<

 expected losses (impairments) are to be taken into consideration earlier than is the case today.
In 2013, IASB also presented an exposure draft regarding accounting for insurance contracts (IFRS 4 Phase II, now called "IFRS 17") that could

<<<

 change the valuation and presentation of technical accounts to a significant extent. The exposure draft proposes the use of margin accounting to replace the current gross accounting presentation for a significant part of written insurance contracts

<<<

. However the exposure draft also presents a simplified approach, which is more in line with the If Group's accounting presentation as of today and that is applicable to the business.
The Issuer believes that there will be significant cross

<<<

-influences between the two standards that need to be carefully assessed. Depending on the classification of financial assets at the implementation of IFRS 9 and changes that may eventually be required by IFRS 17, the financial reporting of

<<<

 the If Group may change compared to the current standards, which could adversely affect the presentation of operating performance and financial position.
Changes in tax legislation may result in adverse tax consequences for the If Group
Tax

<<<

 rules, including those relating to the insurance industry, and their interpretation, may change, possibly with retrospective effect, in any of the jurisdictions in which the If Group operates. Significant tax disputes with tax authorities,

<<<

 and any change in the tax status of any member of the If Group or in taxation legislation or its scope or interpretation could affect the If Group's financial condition and results of operation. This may, in turn, adversely impact the ability

<<<

 of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under or in connection with the Notes.
On 12th June, 2014, the Swedish Corporate Taxation Committee (Sw. Företagsskattekommittén) (the "Taxation Committee") presented a final report in which a new model

<<<

 for the corporate tax treatment of the cost of capital in Sweden was proposed with the stated goal of increasing neutrality in the tax treatment of debt and equity and providing for a more unified corporate tax model. As a revised proposal

<<<

 of the Taxation Committee's report, the Swedish Government has in the 2016 Fall Fiscal Policy Bill proposed that the deductibility of interest expenses related to certain securities including capital instruments (in the current proposal, this

<<<

 includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 items and instruments) issued by banks and insurance companies be abolished. The changes are proposed to enter into force on 1 January 2017 and would apply to interest payments accruing from this date. The proposal

<<<

 is subject to processing by the Swedish Parliament. To the extent the proposal is adopted or any other additional restriction on the deductibility of interest expenses, related to capital instruments is introduced, this may increase the amount

<<<

 of tax which the Issuer has to pay.
The tax payable by the If Group could also increase as a result of the proposals to introduce financial activity taxes in Norway and Sweden. On 6 October 2016, the Norwegian budget proposal for the financial

<<<

 year 2017 was published including a proposal to introduce a financial activity tax. According to the proposal, both Norwegian and foreign companies engaged in financial activities in Norway would be subject to a 5 per cent. tax based on compensation

<<<

 paid to employees in Norway. The budget proposal also proposes reducing the general corporate tax rate from 25 per cent. to 24 per cent. as and from fiscal years ending in 2017. It is, however, proposed that entities engaged in financial activities

<<<

 would continue to pay corporate tax at the 25 per cent. rate. On 7 November 2016, the Swedish Department of Finance published a report proposing the introduction of a financial activity tax in Sweden as and from 1 January 2018. It is proposed

<<<

 that Swedish and foreign companies engaged in financial activities in Sweden be subject to pay tax at a rate of 15 per cent. of the compensation paid to employees in Sweden. Both proposals are subject to the parliamentary processes in Norway

<<<

 and Sweden and it is currently unclear if, and to what extent, the proposals will be entered into law.

Risks relating to the structure of the Notes
Set out below is a brief description of certain risks relating to the structure of the

<<<

 Notes, generally:
The Notes are long-term securities
The Notes are scheduled to be redeemed at their principal amount on 1 December 2046 (the "Maturity Date"), provided that on such date that the Issuer is Solvent and will remain Solvent immediately

<<<

 after redemption, there is no suspension of redemption pursuant to Condition 6(b) (Issuer suspension of redemption date) and the preconditions to redemption set out in Condition 6(g) (Preconditions to redemption, purchases, variation and substitution

<<<

) are fulfilled, and provided that the prior approval of the Issuer Supervisor (if required) has been obtained. If this is not the case, the redemption of the Notes will be suspended (see "Under certain conditions, redemption of the Notes must

<<<

 be suspended" below).
The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Notes at any time before this date, and the Noteholders have no right to call for their redemption.
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are subordinated
The claims of

<<<

 Noteholders and Couponholders against the Issuer in respect of payments of principal and interest on the Notes will, in the event of the liquidation, dissolution, administration or other winding-up of the Issuer, be subordinated in right of

<<<

 payment to the claims of all Senior Creditors of the Issuer. Although subordinated notes may pay a higher rate of interest than comparable notes which are not subordinated, there is a real risk that an investor in the Notes will lose all or

<<<

 some of his investment should the Issuer become insolvent.
Under certain conditions, interest payments under the Notes may be optionally or mandatorily deferred
The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes are conditional upon the

<<<

 Issuer being Solvent at the time of payment, and still being Solvent immediately thereafter. The Issuer shall be entitled to defer payment on any Interest Payment Date if no distribution or dividend or other payment (including payment in relation

<<<

 to redemption or repurchase) has been made on or in respect of any Junior Obligations or Parity Obligations during the six (6) months immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date and provided such Interest Payment Date is not a Mandatory

<<<

 Interest Deferral Date, being each Interest Payment Date in respect of which any event has occurred and is continuing, or would occur if a payment of interest was made, which under Solvency II and/or the Relevant Rules would require the Issuer

<<<

 to defer Interest Payments (or, if applicable, Arrears of Interest) in respect of the Notes and/or where the Issuer Supervisor has directly notified the Issuer in writing that such deferral of Interest Payments (or, if applicable, Arrears of

<<<

 Interest) in respect of the Notes is required.
The Issuer must defer payment of interest accrued in respect of the Notes on any Mandatory Interest Deferral Date and any such deferral shall not constitute a default in respect of the Notes.
All

<<<

 deferred interest on the Notes shall become due and payable in accordance with Condition 4(c) (Arrears of Interest). After the Issuer has fully paid all deferred interest on the Notes, if the Notes remain outstanding, future interest payments

<<<

 on the Notes may be subject to further deferral as described above.
Any actual or anticipated deferral of interest payments is likely to have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest deferral

<<<

 provisions of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which original issue discount or interest accrues that are not subject to such deferrals and may be more sensitive

<<<

 generally to adverse changes in the financial condition of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group.
Under certain conditions, redemption of the Notes must be suspended
The obligations of the Issuer to make payments under the

<<<

 Notes are conditional upon the Issuer being Solvent (as defined in the Conditions) at the time of payment, and still being Solvent immediately thereafter and, in the case of the redemption of the Notes, the satisfaction of Condition 6(g) (Preconditions

<<<

 to redemption, purchases, variation and substitution) and the relevant proposed redemption date not being a Mandatory Redemption Suspension Date, being any date in respect of which any event has occurred and is continuing, or would occur if

<<<

 the payment of the relevant redemption amount was made, which under Solvency II and/or under the Relevant Rules would require the Issuer to
- 12-

suspend repayment or redemption of the Notes and/or where the Issuer Supervisor has directly

<<<

 notified the Issuer in writing that such suspension of repayment or redemption of the Notes is required.
Any actual or anticipated suspension of redemption is likely to have an adverse effect on the market value of the Notes and Noteholders

<<<

 may receive their investment back at a later point in time than initially expected. If the Notes are not redeemed on the Maturity Date due to the reasons set out above, Noteholders will (subject to any mandatory or optional deferral of interest

<<<

 payments) continue to receive interest but will not receive any additional compensation for the suspension of the redemption. In addition, as a result of the redemption suspension provision of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be

<<<

 more volatile than the market price of other debt securities which are not subject to such suspensions and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the financial condition of the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group

<<<

.
The Notes are subject to optional redemption, substitution or variation by the Issuer
The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes (or substitute the Notes for, or vary the terms of the Notes so that they become or remain, Qualifying Tier

<<<

 2 Securities) upon the occurrence of certain events, including an adverse change in tax consequences, a Capital Disqualification Event or a Rating Agency Event, as further described in Condition 6 (Redemption, Purchase, Substitution and Variation

<<<

). The Issuer may also, at its option, on the First Call Date or any Interest Payment Date thereafter, redeem the Notes, as further described in Condition 6 (Redemption, Purchase, Substitution and Variation). During any period when the Issuer

<<<

 may elect to redeem the Notes, their market value generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.
The Issuer may redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing

<<<

 is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, it may be the case that an investor would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and

<<<

 may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
No limitation on issuing further debt
There is no restriction on the amount

<<<

 of debt which the Issuer may issue ranking equal or senior to the obligations under or in connection with the Notes subject to prior approval from the Issuer Supervisor. Such issuance of further debt may reduce the amount recoverable by the

<<<

 Noteholders upon insolvency or winding-up of the Issuer or may increase the likelihood that payments of the principal amount or interest under the Notes will be mandatorily suspended or deferred or may, in the case of interest payments, be

<<<

 deferred at the option of the Issuer.
In addition, the Notes do not contain any "negative pledge" or similar clause, meaning that the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may pledge its or their assets to secure other obligations without granting similar

<<<

 security in respect of the Notes.
There are no events of default under the Notes
The Conditions do not provide for events of default allowing acceleration of the Notes if certain events occur. Accordingly, if the Issuer fails to meet any obligations

<<<

 under the Notes, including the payment of any interest when due, investors will not have any right of acceleration in respect of the Notes.
Upon a payment default, the sole remedy available to Noteholders for recovery of amounts owing in respect

<<<

 of any payment of principal or interest on the Notes will be the institution of proceedings to enforce such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not, by virtue of the institution of any such proceedings, be obliged to pay

<<<

 any sum or sums sooner than the same would otherwise have been payable by it.
Set-off risk
Subject to applicable law, no Noteholder who shall be indebted to the Issuer shall be entitled to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against

<<<

 moneys owed to the Issuer in respect of such indebtedness.
- 13-

Fixed to Floating Rate Notes and interest rate risks
The Fixed/Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a fixed rate to and including the First Call Date.
During that time, holders

<<<

 of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes are exposed to the risk that the price of such Fixed/Floating Rate Notes may fall because of changes in the market yield. While the nominal interest rate (i.e. the coupon) of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes is

<<<

 fixed until (but excluding) the First Call Date, the market yield typically changes on a daily basis. As the market yield changes, the price of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes changes in the opposite direction. If the market yield increases,

<<<

 the price of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes falls. If the market yield falls, the price of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes increases. Holders of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes should be aware that movements of the market yield can adversely affect

<<<

 the price of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes and can lead to losses for the holders of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes.
Holders of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes should also be aware that the market yield has two components, namely the risk-free

<<<

 rate and the credit spread. The credit spread is reflective of the yield that investors require in addition to the yield on a risk­free investment of equal tenor as a compensation for the risks inherent in the Notes. The credit spread changes

<<<

 over time and can decrease as well as increase for a large number of different reasons.
The market yield of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes can change due to changes in the credit spread, the risk-free rate, or both.
If the Fixed/Floating Rate

<<<

 Notes are not called on the First Call Date, the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate from, and including, the First Call Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a

<<<

 floating rate from, and including the Issue Date. In each case, the floating rate applicable to the Notes is based on two components, namely the 3-months STIBOR and the Margin. The floating rate (i.e. the coupon) is payable quarterly, and will

<<<

 be set immediately prior to any floating Interest Period to the then prevailing 3-months STIBOR rate plus the Margin. The Margin is fixed at the time of issuance of the transaction.
Noteholders should be aware that the floating rate interest

<<<

 income is subject to changes to the 3-months STIBOR and therefore cannot be anticipated. Hence, Noteholders are not able to determine a definite yield of the Notes at the time of purchase, so that their return on investment cannot be compared

<<<

 with that of investments in simple fixed rate (i.e. fixed rate coupons only) instruments.
Since the Margin is fixed at the time of issuance of the transaction, Noteholders are subject to the risk that the Margin does not reflect the spread

<<<

 that investors require in addition to the 3-months STIBOR as a compensation for the risks inherent in the Notes (market spread). The market spread typically changes on a daily basis. As the market spread changes, the price of the Notes changes

<<<

 in the opposite direction. A decrease in the market spread has a positive impact on the price of the Notes; an increase in the market spread has a negative impact on the price of the Notes. However, the price of the Notes is subject to changes

<<<

 in the market spread, changes in the 3-months STIBOR or both. Noteholders should be aware that movements in the market spread can adversely affect the price of the Notes and can lead to losses for the Noteholders.
In addition, Noteholders are

<<<

 exposed to reinvestment risk with respect to proceeds from coupon payments or early redemptions by the Issuer. If the market yield (or market spread respectively) declines, and if Noteholders want to invest such proceeds in comparable transactions

<<<

, Noteholders will only be able to reinvest such proceeds in comparable transactions at the then prevailing lower market yields (or market spreads respectively).
The market value of the Notes could decrease if the creditworthiness of the Issuer

<<<

, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group worsens
If the likelihood that the Issuer will be in a position to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due decreases, for example, because of the materialisation of any of

<<<

 the risks regarding the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group, the market value of the Notes may suffer. In addition, even if the likelihood that the Issuer will be in position to fully perform all obligations under the Notes

<<<

 when they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless have a different perception.
- 14-

In addition, the market participants' estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating

<<<

 in the same business as the Issuer, the Issuer's Group or the Solvency II Group could adversely change. If any of these risks occurs, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower price than before the materialisation of

<<<

 the aforementioned risk. Under these circumstances, the market value of the Notes may decrease.
Implementation of the Solvency II Directive
The Notes are issued for capital adequacy regulatory purposes with the intention that all the proceeds

<<<

 of the Notes be eligible, (x) for the purpose of the determination of the Solvency II Group's (as defined in the Conditions) solvency margin or capital adequacy levels under Solvency II and/or the Relevant Rules or (y) as at least tier two

<<<

 own funds regulatory capital (or whatever the terminology employed by under Solvency II and/or the Relevant Rules) for the purposes of the determination of its regulatory capital under Solvency II and/or the Relevant Rules, except, in each

<<<

 case, as a result of the application of the limits on inclusion (on a solo, group or consolidated basis) of such securities in, respectively, its solvency margin or own funds regulatory capital, as the case may be.
The implementation of the

<<<

 Solvency II Directive in Finland and the "level two" implementation measures set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 entered into force on 1 January 2016.
There can be no assurance that, following their initial

<<<

 publication, the "level two" implementation measures and "level three" guidance will not be amended. Moreover, there is uncertainty as to how regulators, including the Financial Supervisory Authority in Finland (Fi. Finanssivalvonta) will interpret

<<<

 the Solvency II Directive as implemented in Finland, the "level two" implementation measures and/or "level three" guidance and apply them to the Solvency II Group, the Issuer or the Issuer's Group.
Accordingly, Noteholders should be aware that

<<<

 practice under the Solvency II Directive may lead to, or increase the likelihood of, a deferral of payments under the Notes and/or an early redemption of the Notes. Such practice may also impact the Issuer's ability to pay any amounts due on

<<<

 the Notes.
In addition to capital requirement framework changes in the insurance industry such as Solvency II, the capital requirement framework changes in the banking industry such as fundamental reforms to the regulatory capital framework

<<<

 for internationally active banks proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are relevant for the Sampo Group through its associated company Nordea. Nordea is required to meet more stringent and extensive capital requirements in

<<<

 the future, including, but not limited to, Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment

<<<

 firms and the direct application of a European Parliament and Council regulation in each member state of the EEA, the directive providing for the establishment of a European-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions

<<<

 and investment firms and the Financial Stability Board's Total Loss Absorbing Capacity standard for global systemically important banks. Potential non-compliance by Nordea could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations

<<<

 and financial condition of the Sampo Group, which could adversely impact the Issuer's ability to fulfill its obligations under or in connection with the Notes. New capital requirements may also have a negative effect on Nordea's profitability

<<<

 and the Sampo Group's regulatory solvency position.
Regulatory oversight and application of Minimum Capital Requirements and Solvency Capital Requirements to the Issuer, the Issuer's Group and the Solvency II Group
As of the date of this prospectus

<<<

, events which may give rise to a Capital Disqualification Event, a Regulatory Deficiency Interest Deferral Event and a Regulatory Deficiency Redemption Suspension Event (each of which may lead to an optional early redemption of the Notes, or

<<<

 a compulsory deferral of interest payments or suspension of redemption under the Notes) apply in relation to the Solvency II Group only and not to the Issuer or the Issuer's Group. Currently, the Solvency II Group is subject to regulation by

<<<

 the Financial Supervisory Authority in Finland (Fi. Finanssivalvonta) and for Solvency II purposes, neither the Issuer nor the Issuer's Group is subject to direct supervision by a national regulatory authority. Individual operating members

<<<

 of the Issuer's Group are subject to direct supervision by national regulatory authorities (see "Regulation ­ Supervision"). In the event that in the future, the regulatory oversight of the Issuer and the Issuer's Group changes such that the

<<<

 Issuer and the Issuer's Group are subject to direct supervision by a national regulatory authority for Solvency II purposes, then pursuant to
- 15-

the terms of the Notes, from such time a Capital Disqualification Event, a Regulatory Deficiency

<<<

 Interest Deferral Event or a Regulatory Deficiency Redemption Suspension Event shall also apply at the level of the Issuer and the Issuer's Group, which will be a smaller regulatory group than the Solvency II Group.
In the event of any change

<<<

 in the regulatory oversight of the Issuer and the Issuer's Group, which results in direct supervision of the Issuer and the Issuer's Group for Solvency II purposes (whether on a solo, group or consolidated basis), the Issuer and the Issuer

<<<

's Group may be required to raise further capital in order to maintain the then applicable Minimum Capital Requirement and Solvency Capital Requirement.
Risks relating to the Notes generally
Set out below is a brief description of certain risks

<<<

 relating to the Notes generally:
Meeting of Noteholders, modification and waivers
The Conditions contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined

<<<

 majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
The Conditions also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent

<<<

 of the Noteholders or Couponholders, agree to any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed for each of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes

<<<

 and the Floating Rate Notes.
Change of law
The Conditions are based on English and Swedish law in effect as at the date of this Prospectus. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English or

<<<

 Swedish law or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.
There is no active trading market for the Notes
The Notes are new securities which may not be widely distributed and for which there is currently no active trading market

<<<

. If the Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount to their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and the financial

<<<

 condition of the Issuer. Although applications have been made for the Notes to be admitted to listing on the official list and trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market, there is no assurance that such applications will be

<<<

 accepted or that an active trading market will develop. Accordingly, there is no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Notes.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks
The Notes are expected to be rated BBB

<<<

 by S&P. S&P is established in the European Economic Area and registered under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009, as amended (the "CRA Regulation") and is, as of the date of this Prospectus, included in the list of credit rating agencies published

<<<

 by the European Securities and Markets Authority on its website (http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certifiedCRAs) in accordance with the CRA Regulation. The rating may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to

<<<

 the structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be suspended, revised or withdrawn by the rating

<<<

 agency at any time. Any adverse change in an applicable credit rating could adversely affect the trading price for the Notes. In addition, rating agencies other than S&P could seek to rate the Notes and if such unsolicited ratings are lower

<<<

 than the comparable ratings assigned to the Notes by S&P, those unsolicited ratings could have an adverse effect on the value and the marketability of the Notes.
Taxation
Potential purchasers and sellers of the Notes should be aware that they

<<<

 may be required to pay taxes or documentary charges or duties in accordance with the laws and practices of the jurisdiction where the Notes are transferred to other jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, no official statements of the tax
- 

<<<

16-

authorities or court decisions may be available for financial instruments such as the Notes. Potential investors cannot rely upon such tax summary contained in this Prospectus but should ask for their own tax adviser's advice on their

<<<

 individual taxation with respect to the subscription, acquisition, holding, disposal and redemption of the Notes. Only this adviser is in a position to duly consider the specific situation of the potential investor. This investment consideration

<<<

 has to be read in connection with the taxation sections of this Prospectus.
The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT)
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a

<<<

 common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States"). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.
The Commission's Proposal has

<<<

 very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions) where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State

<<<

. A financial institution may be, or deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial

<<<

 instrument which is subject to dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States and the scope of any such tax is uncertain. It may therefore be altered prior

<<<

 to implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
Payments on the Notes may

<<<

 be subject to Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act withholding
Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within Euroclear and Clearstream Luxembourg (together, the "ICSDs"), in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that

<<<

 the new reporting regime and potential withholding tax imposed by sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") will affect the amount of any payment received by the ICSDs. However, FATCA may affect payments

<<<

 made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. It may also affect payment to any

<<<

 ultimate investor that is a financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives

<<<

 payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant

<<<

 with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a payment free

<<<

 of FATCA withholding. Investors should consult their own tax adviser to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has made payment to, or to the

<<<

 order of, the common depositary for the ICSDs (as bearer of the Notes) and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the ICSDs and custodians or intermediaries. Further, foreign financial institutions

<<<

 in a jurisdiction which has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States (an "IGA") are generally not expected to be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) from non-U.S. source payments

<<<

 they make.
OECD base erosion and profit shifting
In May 2013, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") Council at Ministerial Level adopted a declaration on base erosion and profit shifting urging the OECD's Committee

<<<

 on Fiscal Affairs to develop an action plan to address base erosion and profit shifting in a comprehensive manner and in July 2013 the OECD launched an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, identifying 15 specific actions to achieve

<<<

 this (the "BEPS Project"). These action points relate to, amongst other things, restricting the deductibility of interest payments (Action 4), preventing the granting of tax treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances (Action 6) and preventing

<<<

 the artificial avoidance of
- 17-

permanent establishment status (Action 7). All of the action points have been subject to public consultation and on 5 October 2015 the OECD Secretariat published 13 final reports and an explanatory statement

<<<

 outlining consensus actions. The BEPS Project is expected to generate changes to tax policy and systems in numerous jurisdictions. However, it is not yet known when the actions will be implemented and which countries will implement them. It

<<<

 is not possible to assess at this stage whether there would be any impact to the tax payable by the If Group or other adverse tax consequences, any of which could reduce amounts available for distribution to Noteholders.
Exchange rate risks

<<<

 and exchange controls
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in Swedish Krona. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or

<<<

 currency unit (the Investor's Currency) other than Swedish Krona. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of Swedish Krona or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the

<<<

 risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to Swedish Krona would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency-equivalent

<<<

 yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes (see "risks relating to the Issuer ­ currency risk").
Government and

<<<

 monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal

<<<

.
Because the Global Notes are held by or on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on their procedures for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will be represented by the Global

<<<

 Notes except in certain limited circumstances described in the Permanent Global Note. The Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in certain limited circumstances described in

<<<

 the Permanent Global Note, investors will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are represented by the Global

<<<

 Notes, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.
The Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to or to the order of the common depositary

<<<

 for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg for distribution to their account holders. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to receive payments under the Notes

<<<

. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in the Global Notes.
Holders of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not have a direct right to vote in

<<<

 respect of the Notes. Instead, such holders will be permitted to act only to the extent that they are enabled by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to appoint appropriate proxies.
Independent review and advice
Each prospective investor in

<<<

 the Notes must determine, based on its own independent review and such professional advice as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, that its acquisition of the Notes is fully consistent with its financial needs, objectives and condition

<<<

, complies and is fully consistent with all investment policies, guidelines and restrictions applicable to it and is a fit, proper and suitable investment for it, notwithstanding the clear and substantial risks inherent in investing in or holding

<<<

 the Notes.
Each prospective investor should consult its own advisers as to legal, tax and related aspects of an investment in the Notes. A prospective investor may not rely on the Issuer or the Joint Lead Managers or any of their respective

<<<

 affiliates in connection with its determination as to the legality of its acquisition of the Notes or as to the other matters referred to above.
- 18-

The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors The Notes are complex financial

<<<

 instruments. Sophisticated institutional investors generally purchase complex financial instruments as part of a wider financial structure rather than as standalone investments. They purchase complex financial instruments as a way to reduce

<<<

 risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless it has the expertise (either alone or with a financial adviser) to evaluate

<<<

 how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment portfolio. Each potential investor in the Notes must

<<<

 determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each investor should: (i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the
merits and the risks of investing

<<<

 the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement; (ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial

<<<

 situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio; (iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where the

<<<

 currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency; (iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and (v) be

<<<

 able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial advisor) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks. Legal investment considerations

<<<

 may restrict certain investments The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers

<<<

 to determine whether and to what extent (1) the Notes are legal investments for it, (2) the Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Notes. Financial institutions

<<<

 should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE FIXED/FLOATING RATE NOTES In these

<<<

 terms and conditions, references to the Notes are to the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes.

The following is the text of the Terms and Conditions of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes (the "Conditions") which (subject to completion and amendment) will

<<<

 be endorsed on each Note in definitive form (if issued):

The SEK 500,000,000 Fixed/Floating Rate Dated Subordinated Notes due 2046 (the "Notes", which expression shall in these Conditions, unless the context otherwise requires, include any

1.

Form, Denomination

<<<

 and Title

The Notes are in bearer form, serially numbered, in the denominations of SEK 2,000,000 and integral multiples of SEK 1,000,000, each with Coupons and one Talon attached on issue. Notes of one denomination may not be exchanged for

<<<

 Notes of any other denomination. Title to the Notes and to the Coupons will pass by delivery. The Issuer, any Paying Agent and the Trustee may (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws) deem and treat the bearer of any Note, principal

<<<

 amount or Coupon as the absolute owner for all purposes (whether or not the Note, principal amount or Coupon shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership thereof or writing thereon, or any notice of loss or theft or of any trust

<<<

 or interest therein) and shall not be required to obtain any proof thereof or as to the identity of such bearer.

2.

Status and Subordination

(a) Status: The Notes and Coupons constitute, in the case of the Notes, dated and, in the case of

<<<

 the Notes and the Coupons, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer, conditional as described below, and at all times rank: (i) junior to Senior Creditors; (ii) pari passu without any preference among themselves and among Parity

<<<

 Obligations outstanding from time to time (whether actual or contingent); and (iii) senior to all classes of Junior Obligations.

(b) Subordination: The right to payment in respect of the Notes and the Coupons is subordinated in the event of

<<<

 the Liquidation of the Issuer and (except in the event of the Liquidation of the Issuer) all payments of principal and interest by the Issuer in respect of the Notes and the Coupons are conditional upon the Issuer being Solvent at the time

<<<

 of payment and immediately thereafter (the "Solvency Condition") and (except as aforesaid) no principal or interest shall be payable in respect of the Notes or the Coupons except to the extent that the Issuer could make such payment in whole

<<<

 or in part, rateably with the payments in respect of Parity Obligations, and still be Solvent immediately thereafter.

- 20-

The payment of interest on the Notes is also subject to the provisions of Condition 4 (Deferral of Payments) and

<<<

 the payment of principal on the Notes is also subject to the provisions of Condition 6(b) (Issuer suspension of redemption date).
The provisions of this Condition 2 (Status and Subordination) apply only to the principal and interest in respect

<<<

 of the Notes and nothing in this Condition 2(b) (Subordination) shall affect or prejudice the payment of the costs, charges, expenses, liabilities or remuneration of the Trustee or the rights and remedies of the Trustee in respect thereof.

<<<


(c) No Set-off: No Holders of Notes or Coupons who shall be indebted to the Issuer shall be entitled to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against moneys owed to the Issuer in respect of such indebtedness.

3.

Interest

(a) Interest

<<<

 Payment Dates: The Notes bear interest on their outstanding principal amount from and including the Interest Commencement Date, payable (subject as provided below) annually in arrear on 1 December in each year from and including 1 December

<<<

 2017 to and including the First Call Date (each a "Fixed Interest Payment Date"). Thereafter interest will be payable quarterly in arrear on 1 March, 1 June, 1 September, and 1 December in each year (together with each Fixed Interest Payment

<<<

 Date, each an "Interest Payment Date"). If any Interest Payment Date (other than a Fixed Interest Payment Date) would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day it shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day unless it

<<<

 would then fall into the next calendar month in which event such Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day.

Whenever it is necessary to compute an amount of interest in respect of the Notes for

<<<

 a period other than an Interest Period and such period ends prior to the First Call Date or on the First Call Date, such interest shall be calculated by applying the Fixed Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount (taking into account any

<<<

 adjustment to such amount during such Interest Period), multiplying such sum by the Fixed Day Count Fraction and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest öre, half an öre being rounded upwards, or otherwise in accordance with applicable

<<<

 market convention.

Whenever it is necessary to calculate an amount of interest in respect of the Notes for a period beginning on or after the First Call Date, such interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the

<<<

 relevant period divided by 360 and otherwise in accordance with Condition 3(d) (Determination of Floating Rate of Interest and Interest Amount) below.
(b) Interest Accrual: Each Note will cease to bear interest from and including its due date

<<<

 for redemption (which due date shall, in the case of suspension of a redemption date in accordance with Condition 6(b) (Issuer suspension of redemption date), be the latest date to which redemption of the Notes is so suspended) unless, upon

<<<

 due presentation, payment of the principal in respect of the Note is improperly withheld or refused or unless default is otherwise made in respect of payment, in which event interest shall continue to accrue as provided in the Trust Deed.


<<<


(c) Interest Rate: The rate of interest payable in respect of each Interest Period ending prior to the First Call Date shall be 2.415 per cent. per annum (the "Fixed Rate of Interest").

Thereafter, the rate of interest payable from time to

<<<

 time in respect of the Notes (the "Floating Rate of Interest") will be determined on the basis of the following provisions:

(i) the Floating Rate of Interest for the Interest Period shall be the Screen Rate plus the Margin. On each Interest

<<<

 Determination Date, the Agent Bank will determine the Screen Rate at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on that Interest Determination Date;

- 21-

(ii) if the Screen Rate is unavailable, the Agent Bank will request the principal Stockholm

<<<

 office of each of the Reference Banks to provide the Agent Bank with the rate at which deposits in Swedish Krona are offered by it to prime banks in the Stockholm interbank market for three months at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time

<<<

) on the Interest Determination Date in question and for a Representative Amount;

(iii) if at least two of the Reference Banks provide such rates, the Floating Rate of Interest for the Interest Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded if

<<<

 necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) as established by the Agent Bank of such rates, plus the Margin; and

(iv) if fewer than two rates are provided as requested, the Floating Rate of Interest shall be

<<<

 determined as at the last preceding Interest Determination Date (save in respect of the first Interest Period following the First Call Date, in which case the Floating Rate of Interest shall be equal to the Fixed Rate of Interest).

(d) Determination

<<<

 of Floating Rate of Interest and Interest Amount: In respect of each Interest Period starting on or after the First Call Date, the Agent Bank shall, as soon as practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on each Interest Determination Date

<<<

 determine the Swedish Krona amount (the "Interest Amount") payable in respect of interest on each Note for the relevant Interest Period. The Interest Amount shall be determined by applying the Floating Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount

<<<

, multiplying the sum by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360, rounding the resultant figure to the nearest öre (half an öre being rounded upwards, or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention

<<<

) and multiplying such rounded figure by a fraction equal to the denomination of such Note divided by the Calculation Amount.

(e) Publication of Floating Rate of Interest and Interest Amount: The Agent Bank shall cause the Floating Rate of

<<<

 Interest and the Interest Amount for each Interest Period starting on or after the First Call Date and the relative Interest Payment Date to be notified to the Issuer, the Paying Agents and the Trustee and to any stock exchange or other relevant

<<<

 authority on which the Notes are at the relevant time listed (by no later than the first day of each Interest Period) and to be published in accordance with Condition 11 (Notices) as soon as possible after their determination, and in no event

<<<

 later than the second Business Day thereafter. The Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening

<<<

 of the Interest Period. If the Calculation Amount is less than the minimum denomination, the Agent Bank shall not be obliged to publish each Interest Amount but instead may publish only the Calculation Amount and the Interest Amount in respect

<<<

 of a Note having the minimum denomination.

(f)

Notifications, etc. to be final: All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates,

calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the

<<<

 provisions of this Condition 3 (Interest), whether by the Reference

Banks (or any of them), the Agent Bank or the Trustee (or its agent), shall (in the

absence of the Reference Banks', the Agent Bank's or the Trustee's, as applicable, own

<<<



gross negligence, fraud or wilful default) be binding on the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agent

Bank, the Paying Agents and all Noteholders and Couponholders and (in the absence of

the Reference Banks', the Agent Bank's or the Trustee's, as

<<<

 applicable, own gross

negligence, fraud or wilful default) no liability to the Issuer, or the Noteholders or the

Couponholders shall attach to the Reference Banks (or any of them), the Agent Bank or,

if applicable, the Trustee (or its agent

<<<

) in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by any of them of their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 3 (Interest).

(g) Agent Bank: The Issuer shall procure that, so long as any of the Notes remains outstanding (as defined

<<<

 in the Trust Deed), there is at all times an Agent Bank for the purposes of the Notes and the Issuer may, subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee, terminate the appointment of the Agent Bank. In the event of the appointed

- 2

<<<

2-

office of any bank being unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Agent Bank or failing duly to determine the Floating Rate of Interest and the Interest Amount for any Interest Period, the Issuer shall, subject to the prior written

<<<

 approval of the Trustee, appoint the Stockholm office of another major bank engaged in the Stockholm interbank market to act in its place. The Agent Bank may resign its duties without a successor having been appointed however; such resignation

<<<

 will only take effect upon appointment of a successor. The Agent Bank may not be removed without a successor having been appointed.

4.

Deferral of Payments

(a) Optional Deferral of Interest: Without prejudice to Condition 4(b) (Mandatory

<<<

 Deferral of Interest), on any Optional Interest Payment Date, the Issuer may in the manner described in Condition 4(d) (Notification in respect of Interest Payments) elect not to
pay the interest in respect of the Notes accrued in the Interest

<<<

 Period ending on the day
immediately preceding such date. If the Issuer so elects, it shall not have any obligation to make such Interest Payment and any failure to pay shall not constitute a default by the
Issuer for any purpose unless the

<<<

 Interest Payment Date constitutes a Compulsory
Interest Payment Date in which case such Interest Payment will be payable and may not be deferred.

(b) Mandatory Deferral of Interest:

(i) Subject to Condition 4(b)(ii) below, Interest Payments

<<<

 by the Issuer will be mandatorily deferred on each Mandatory Interest Deferral Date and such failure to pay shall not constitute a default by the Issuer for any purpose.

(ii) Notwithstanding that an Interest Payment Date may be a Mandatory

<<<

 Interest Deferral Date, Interest Payments may still be paid on that relevant Interest Payment Date to the extent that:

(A) the Issuer Supervisor has exceptionally waived the deferral of Interest Payments;

(B) such Interest Payments do not

<<<

 further weaken the solvency position of the Issuer; and

(C) the Minimum Capital Requirement is complied with immediately after such Interest Payments are made.

(iii) At the same time as notifying the Trustee and the Noteholders of a Mandatory

<<<

 Interest Deferral Date in accordance with Condition 4(d) (Notification in respect of Interest Payments), the Issuer shall send to the Trustee a certificate signed by two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer confirming that the relevant Interest

<<<

 Payment Date is a Mandatory Interest Deferral Date. Any such certificate shall, in the absence of manifest error, be treated and accepted by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Noteholders and all other interested parties as correct and sufficient

<<<

 evidence thereof, shall be binding on all such persons and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such certificate without liability to any person.
(c) Arrears of Interest:

(i) Any interest in respect of the Notes not paid on an Interest

<<<

 Payment Date as a
result of the exercise by the Issuer of its discretion to defer such Interest Payments pursuant to Condition 4(a) (Optional Deferral of Interest), the
obligation of the Issuer to defer such Interest Payments pursuant to Condition

<<<

 4(b) (Mandatory Deferral of Interest) and any interest not paid due to the
Solvency Condition not being satisfied, shall, to the extent and so long as the
same remains unpaid, constitute "Arrears of Interest".

Each amount of Arrears of Interest

<<<

 shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, as if it constituted the principal amount of the Notes at a rate

- 23-

which corresponds to the Fixed Rate of Interest or Floating Rate of Interest (as the case may be) applicable

<<<

 to the Notes from time to time and the amount of such interest (the "Additional Interest Amount") with respect to Arrears of Interest shall be due and payable pursuant to Condition 4(c)(ii) (Arrears of Interest) below and shall be calculated

<<<

 by the Agent Bank applying the applicable Fixed Rate of Interest or Floating Rate of Interest (as the case may be) to the amount of the Arrears of Interest and otherwise mutatis mutandis as provided in the foregoing provisions hereof. The Additional

<<<

 Interest Amount accrued up to any Interest Payment Date shall be added, to the extent permitted by applicable law and for the purpose only of calculating the Additional Interest Amount accruing thereafter, to the amount of Arrears of Interest

<<<

 remaining unpaid on such Interest Payment Date as if such amount constituted Arrears of Interest.
(ii) Arrears of Interest (together with the corresponding Additional Interest Amount, if any) may (subject to the Solvency Condition being satisfied

<<<

(i) Any interest in respect of the Notes not paid on an Interest Payment Date

<<<

result of the exercise by the Issuer of its discretion to defer such Interest Payments pursuant to Condition 4(a) (Optional Deferral of Interest), the

- 43-

obligation of the Issuer to defer such Interest Payments pursuant to Condition

<<<

 4(b) (Mandatory Deferral of Interest) and any interest not paid due to the Solvency Condition not being satisfied, shall, to the extent and so long as the same remains unpaid, constitute "Arrears of Interest". Each amount of Arrears of Interest

<<<

 (the "Additional Interest Amount") with respect to Arrears of Interest shall be due and payable pursuant to Condition 4(c)(ii) (Arrears of Interest) below and shall be calculated by the Agent Bank applying the applicable Rate of Interest to

<<<

 the amount of the Arrears of Interest and otherwise mutatis mutandis as provided in the foregoing provisions hereof. The Additional Interest Amount accrued up to any Interest Payment Date shall be added, to the extent permitted by applicable

<<<

 law and for the purpose only of calculating the Additional Interest Amount accruing thereafter, to the amount of Arrears of Interest remaining unpaid on such Interest Payment Date as if such amount constituted Arrears of Interest. "Additional

<<<

 Interest Amounts" has the meaning given in Condition 4(c) (Arrears of Interest). "Interest Amount" has the meaning given in Condition 3(d) (Determination of Rate of Interest and Interest Amount). "Margin" means (i) 2.25 per cent. per annum

<<<

 for each Interest Period from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date and to but excluding 1 December 2026; and (ii) 3.25 per cent. per annum thereafter (from and including 1 December 2026). "Rate of Interest" has the meaning given in

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE IN GLOBAL FORM

The following is a summary of the provisions to be contained in the Global Notes which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Conditions

<<<

 while the Notes are in global form.

1.

Exchange

Each of the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes will initially be in the form of a temporary global note (respectively, the "Fixed/Floating Rate Temporary Global Note" and

<<<

 the "Floating Rate Temporary Global Note" and, together, the "Temporary Global Notes") which will be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Each Temporary Global Note generally

<<<

 will be exchangeable, in whole or in part, for interests in a permanent global note (respectively, the "Fixed/Floating Rate Permanent Global Note" and the "Floating Rate Permanent Global Note" and, together, the "Permanent Global Notes") not

<<<

 earlier than 40 days after the Issue Date of the Notes upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

The Permanent Global Notes will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for Definitive Notes only

<<<

 if one of the following events (each an "Exchange Event") occurs:

(a) either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces

<<<

 an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or

(b) the Issuer would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation

<<<

 or otherwise) or as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be suffered were the Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two (2) Directors is given to the

<<<

 Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of paragraph (a) above) the holder of the relevant Permanent Global Note (acting on the instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Issuer and

<<<

 (in the case of paragraph (b) above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the Noteholders of its intention to exchange the relevant Permanent Global Note for Definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below).

On or

<<<

 after the Exchange Date a holder of the relevant Permanent Global Note may or, in the case of paragraph (a) above, shall surrender the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent. In exchange for the relevant Permanent

<<<

 Global Note the Issuer will deliver, or procure the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of, an equal aggregate principal amount of Definitive Notes in the denomination of SEK 2,000,000 and integral multiples of SEK 1,000,000 (having

<<<

 attached to them all Coupons in respect of interest which has not already been paid on the relevant Permanent Global Note), security printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in

<<<

 the form set out in the Trust Deed. On exchange of the relevant Permanent Global Note, the Issuer will procure that it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant Definitive Notes.

For these

<<<

 purposes, "Exchange Date" means a day specified in the notice requiring exchange falling not less than 60 days after that on which such notice is given and being a day on which banks are open for general business in the place in which the specified

<<<

 office of the Principal Paying Agent is located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to paragraph (a) above, in the place in which the relevant clearing system is located.

So long as the Notes are represented by the Temporary Global

<<<

 Notes or the Permanent Global Notes and the relevant clearing system(s) so permit, the Notes will be tradeable only in the minimum authorised denomination of SEK 2,000,000, notwithstanding that no Definitive Notes will be issued with a denomination

<<<

<<<

 to the relevant Global Note by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent, which endorsement shall be prima facie evidence that such payment has been made in respect of the Notes. Payments of interest on the Temporary Global Notes (if permitted

<<<

 by the first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

Payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes will not be made within the United States.

 by publication as required by Condition 11 (Notices) except that such notices shall also be published in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or of any stock exchange (or any other relevant

<<<

<<<

 (as the case may be) as aforesaid.

4.

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each person

DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUER, THE ISSUER'S GROUP AND THE SAMPO GROUP
The Issuer
History

<<<

 and Business overview
If P&C Insurance Holding Ltd (publ) (the "Issuer" and, together with its subsidiaries, the "If Group" or "If") (registered under the Swedish name "If Skadeförsäkring Holding AB (publ)") is the Swedish insurance holding

<<<

 company of the If Group. The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated on 25 January 1984 under the laws of Sweden with registration number 556241-7559. The registered offices of the Issuer are in Stockholm, Sweden (visiting

<<<

 address: Barks väg 15, postal address: S-106 80 Stockholm, Tel: +46 771 43 00 00).
The main role of the Issuer is to manage shares in wholly owned property and casualty ("P&C") insurance operations as well as other significant holdings. The

<<<

 Issuer does not conduct any insurance operations. The Issuer is also the main account holder for an If Group cash pool account system comprising the major part of the flow of liquid funds from the insurance operations of the Group. Underlying

<<<

 flows of liquid funds give rise to intra-group transactions within the Issuer's balance sheet. Intra-group transactions also arise in connection with payment of dividends from subsidiaries that are not passed on or invested outside of the If

<<<

 Group.
The Issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sampo plc (together with its subsidiaries, "Sampo Group"), a Finnish company listed on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki. Sampo plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Finland. Its

<<<

 registered office and headquarters are in Helsinki, Finland.
Sampo Group
History
Currently, Sampo Group's main business areas include P&C insurance and life insurance. Sampo Group divested its 100 per cent. owned banking business in 2007 by

<<<

 selling the Sampo Bank Group to Danske Bank A/S.
The roots of Sampo Group's P&C insurance business reach back to the 18th century and its life insurance business dates back to the 19th century. At the beginning of 2002, the P&C insurance operations

<<<

 of Sampo Group were combined with the Issuer. Through this transaction and two other transactions, the Issuer became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sampo plc.
During recent years Sampo Group has, through the Issuer also increased its shareholdings

<<<

 in the Danish insurer, Topdanmark A/S ("Topdanmark"). In May 2011 the Issuer's holding in Topdanmark exceeded 20 per cent. and from 16 May 2011 until 7 September 2016 Topdanmark was recorded as an associated company in If Group's accounts as

<<<

 well as in Sampo Group's accounts. Sampo plc announced on 7 September 2016 the obligation to make a mandatory offer to the shareholders of Topdanmark A/S. In the mandatory offer, Sampo plc offered to acquire all outstanding shares, excluding

<<<

 treasury shares, and other financial instruments, warrants and share options, if applicable, issued by Topdanmark and shares held by Topdanmark shareholders resident in certain restricted jurisdictions. The cash price offered in the mandatory

<<<

 offer was DKK 183 for each share issued by Topdanmark. The offer period commenced on 27 September 2016 and expired on 25 October 2016. As a result of the offer, Sampo plc acquired altogether 7,374,306 Topdanmark shares and held on 26 October

<<<

 2016 41.1 per cent. of all Topdanmark shares. Excluding own shares held by Topdanmark, Sampo plc's holding amounts to over 44 per cent. of Topdanmark shares. The mandatory offer was made pursuant to the Danish Takeover Order (no. 562 of 2 June

<<<

 2014) Section 2(1). The obligation to make the mandatory offer arose as a result of Sampo plc in the period from 6 September 2016 until 7 September having acquired 200,000 Topdanmark shares in the market with the highest purchase price being

<<<

 DKK 183 and thereby crossing the applicable Danish threshold of one third of the total outstanding voting rights of Topdanmark. In connection herewith, Sampo plc also acquired 31,476,920 Topdanmark shares at a price of DKK 183 per share, representing

<<<

 approximately 33.13 per cent. of the entire issued share capital and of all voting rights of Topdanmark (including treasury shares), from the Issuer. Following Sampo plc's acquisition of the Issuer's shareholding in Topdanmark, the Issuer no

<<<

 longer holds any shares in Topdanmark. Topdanmark continues to be recorded as an associated company in Sampo Group's accounts.
- 49-

During recent years, Sampo plc has increased its shareholdings in the Nordic banking group, Nordea Bank AB

<<<

 (publ) ("Nordea"). Sampo plc's holding in Nordea exceeded 20 per cent. in December 2009 and 2010 was the first year Nordea was recorded as an associated company in Sampo Group's accounts. On 31 October 2016, Sampo plc's holding amounted to

<<<

 21.2 per cent. of Nordea. Sampo plc is the largest shareholder in Nordea. In connection with the acquisition of Sampo's banking operations by Danske Bank A/S in early 2007, Sampo Bank plc (now Danske Bank Plc), and Sampo Life Insurance Company

<<<

 Ltd (now Mandatum Life Insurance Company Ltd) signed an agency agreement that guaranteed Sampo Life the exclusive right to sell life and pension insurance products through Danske Bank's branch network in Finland. Mandatum Life decided on 2

<<<

0 October 2016 not to prolong the agency agreement as of 31 December 2016. In relation to the agency agreement Mandatum Life has the right to sell the insurance portfolio sold through Danske Bank's branch network in Finland, to Danske Bank.

<<<

 Mandatum Life decided on 27 October 2016 to use this option. Organisational structure Sampo Group's business is divided into two main business areas: P&C insurance and life insurance. Sampo plc carries out its business through its wholly owned

<<<

 subsidiaries Mandatum Life Insurance Company Limited (together with its subsidiary, "Mandatum Life" or "Mandatum Life Group") and the Issuer. Mandatum Life is a life insurance company operating in Finland and the Baltic countries with a market

<<<

 share of approximately 18 per cent. in Finland and approximately 8 per cent. in the Baltic countries (as of December 2015)1. Life insurance products are sold under the Mandatum Life brand both in Finland and the Baltic countries. According

<<<

 to the latest available market share information, which is based on national insurance association statistics as of December 2015, If is the largest Nordic P&C insurer with a market share of approximately 17 per cent. and also commands a strong

<<<

 position in the Baltic insurance market. P&C insurance products are sold under the If brand. Motor insurance is also available as car branded cover, for example under the Volvia brand. Sampo Group is also one of the largest investors in the

<<<

 Nordic countries. As of 31 December 2015, Sampo Group's investment assets totalled approximately EUR 19,373 million.

Financial development in 2015

Sampo

 (EUR 1,759 million in 2014).
Sampo Group's total investment assets on 31 December 2015 amounted to EUR 19,373 million (EUR 19.215 million in 2014), of which 77 per cent. was invested in fixed income instruments and related derivatives (78 per

 cent. in 2014), 18 per cent. in equities (16 per cent. in 2014), and 5 per cent. in other assets (6 per cent. in 2014). Reported investment income was EUR 998 million (EUR 898 million in 2014).
Sampo Group's balance sheet assets on 31 December

<<<

 2015 amounted to EUR 35,639 million (EUR 34,750 million in 2014 total), of which, the total amount of financial assets increased from EUR 16,930 million to EUR 17,189 million.

- 51-

Sampo Group's equity on 31 December 2015 amounted to EUR

<<<

 11,411 million (EUR 10,924 million in 2014). Equity was strengthened mainly by the comprehensive result for the year of EUR 1,564 million. The largest reduction was the payment of dividends of EUR 1,092 million. Recent financial developments

<<<

 (first nine months of 2016) For the first nine months of 2016 the Sampo Group reported profit before taxes of EUR 1,343 million compared with EUR 1,475 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The development in profit before taxes for

<<<

 each segment of the Sampo Group since 2010 is presented in the graph below (millions of EUR).
Profit after taxes amounted to EUR 1,179 million for the first nine months of 2016 (first nine months 2015: EUR 1,292 million). Total comprehensive

<<<

 income for the period was EUR 1,212 million (first nine months 2015: EUR 1,031 million). Sampo Group's equity on 30 September 2016 amounted to EUR 11,445 million (EUR 11,411 million at the end of December 2015). Capital position and Solvency

<<<

 The Sampo Group regulatory capital requirements and own funds are calculated under both the Solvency II Directive and the Conglomerate Directive. However, for the purposes of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, only the regulatory capital

<<<

 requirement and own funds under the Solvency II Directive are relevant, and not those of the Conglomerate Directive. For the avoidance of doubt in the next sections all concepts, figures and ratios are based on the Solvency II Directive, unless

<<<

 otherwise stated. Solvency II Directive The European Commission has developed a prudential framework for insurance companies known as "Solvency II". Solvency II, implemented on 1 January 2016, introduces a regulatory framework where solvency

<<<

 capital requirements and own funds are risk-based and based on economic valuation principles. According to the Solvency II regulation, Sampo Group is subject to two regulatory intervention points. The first intervention point is the ratio of

<<<

 eligible own funds to group solvency capital requirement ("SCR") including other financial sectors and the undertakings included via deduction and aggregation ("Sampo Group ratio of eligible own funds to group SCR"). The second intervention

<<<

 point is the ratio of eligible own funds to minimum consolidated group SCR ("Sampo Group ratio of eligible own funds to minimum consolidated group SCR"). As of 1 January 2016 the standard formula is applied for Sampo Group as well as all its

<<<

 subsidiaries, in calculating their SCR and minimum capital requirements ("MCR").
- 52-

Sampo Group ratio of eligible own funds to group SCR

Sampo Group's own funds for deriving its ratio of eligible own funds to group SCR are calculated

<<<

 from its consolidated Solvency II balance sheet. Asset and liabilities are valued in accordance with article 75 of the Solvency II Directive. This means that the values are determined at the amount for which the assets could be exchanged and

<<<

 the liabilities could be transferred or settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction (i.e. on an economic value basis). Transitional measures are applied on Mandatum Life's technical provisions in respect of

<<<

 original pension policies with 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent guarantee rates. Also, the volatility adjustment is applied when calculating Mandatum Life's technical provisions.

The Sampo Group group SCR is calculated through two phases:

(i

<<<

) The diversified capital requirement is calculated for the consolidated group including the parent company Sampo plc, If Group and Mandatum Life. There is also a capital requirement for the translation risk related to the SEK denominated equity

<<<

 of the If Group.

(ii) Sampo plc's portion of Nordea's and Topdanmark's capital requirement is added to the consolidated group's capital requirement. Mandatum Life's capital requirement for other financial sectors is added as well.

Transitional

<<<

 measures are used for equity risk when calculating the Sampo Group group SCR. The Sampo Group group SCR accounts for diversification within the consolidated insurance group only, thus excludes the diversification effects of Nordea and Topdanmark

<<<

. Topdanmark's solo own funds and solvency capital requirement are included in the group calculation using the deduction and aggregation method. Nordea is included in Sampo Group's ratio of eligible own funds to group SCR as an associated undertaking

<<<

 according to sectoral rules. As of 30 September 2016, the Sampo Group ratio of eligible own funds to group SCR was 152 per cent.
Sampo Group ratio of eligible own funds to minimum consolidated group SCR

Sampo Group's own funds for deriving

<<<

 its ratio of eligible own funds to minimum consolidated group SCR is calculated from the consolidated Solvency II balance sheet excluding holdings in associated companies Nordea and Topdanmark. The Sampo Group minimum consolidated group SCR

<<<

 is the sum of MCRs of all the individual insurance companies of the If Group and Mandatum Life only. As of 30 September 2016, the Sampo Group ratio of eligible own funds to minimum consolidated group SCR was 223 per cent.

As there is no concept

<<<

 of a minimum capital requirement on a group basis, in accordance with article 331(2)(b) of the Solvency II Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, the MCR applicable to the Sampo Group refers to the minimum consolidated group SCR.

If Group (the Issuer's Group) History

The If Group's P&C insurance

<<<

 business is centred around the Nordic (specifically Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish) insurance markets. The current operations of the Issuer and If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) in Sweden were formed in March 1999, through the merger of the

<<<

 P&C insurance operations of Försäkringsaktiebolaget Skandia (publ) in Sweden and Storebrand ASA in Norway. In January 2002, the P&C insurance operations of the Sampo Group were acquired by the Issuer..

The following insurance companies (also

<<<

 shown in the structure chart on page 51) are wholly-owned by the Issuer: If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) and If Livförsäkring AB in Sweden (the latter company having been acquired from Sampo in 2008), If P&C Insurance Company Ltd in Finland and

<<<

 If P&C Insurance AS in Estonia.

The If Group's operations in Denmark, Norway, and to a limited extent in Finland and Latvia, are conducted via branches of If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) in each country. In addition, If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ

<<<

) has branch offices in France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany to support customers with international operations. The Estonian company If P&C Insurance AS also conducts operations in Latvia and Lithuania via branches.
Vision

<<<

 and Strategy

The If Group's vision is to offer insurance solutions that provide customers with security and stability in their daily lives and business operations with such excellence that the If Group is the preferred insurance provider in

<<<

 the Nordic and Baltic markets. This vision is expressed through the If Group's customer promise: "Relax, we'll help you".

In order to fulfil the vision of being the preferred insurance partner, the If Group has adopted a strategy based on

<<<

 three strategic goals:



Most satisfied customers through strong focus on customer value



To achieve this the If Group must have the best in-depth understanding of its customers'

insurance needs and, correspondingly, the best underwriting

<<<

 skills. The If Group strives

to be the most service-oriented company in the industry and continues to develop its

digital communication.

- 54-



Europe's most professional and innovative P&C insurance people



The If Group continues to

<<<

 strengthen its underwriting competencies within the "Best in

Risk" concept. The concept focuses on understanding all aspects of risk management,

including product, pricing and risk quality, throughout the organisation.



Stable profitability

<<<

 through underwriting excellence and operational efficiency



Profitability of the core business by accurate pricing of risk. Continuous focus on cost

efficiency, an investment strategy based on balanced risk and creditworthiness also

contribute

<<<

 to a strong and stable profitability.

The If Group's financial targets are to achieve a combined ratio of less than 95 per cent. and a return on equity of at least 17.5 per cent.
Business overview

The If Group is one of the leading insurers

<<<

 in Sweden, Norway and Finland with market shares of 18.2 per cent., 21.9 per cent. and 23.6 per cent. respectively2. In the Danish market the If Group (not including Topdanmark) is the sixth largest insurer (by market share) with a market share

<<<

 of 5.8 per cent3.

The Nordic P&C insurance market is relatively consolidated. The four largest players account for approximately 70 to 90 per cent. of the markets in Norway, Finland and Sweden (by market share) and all are established in more

<<<

 than one Nordic country. In Denmark the market is less consolidated. Out of the six leading P&C insurance companies in the Nordic market, two are mutually owned and the rest are publicly traded. In addition to traditional distribution channels

<<<

, the internet continues to grow in importance both as a distribution channel as well as a service channel. Additionally, distribution through partnerships with, for instance, banks and car-dealers is increasingly important.

In the Nordic region

<<<

 customer retention is high with renewal rates of approximately 80 to 90 per cent. The market is characterized by low expense ratios in the range of 15 to 20 per cent.

The Nordic P&C market has generally experienced good profitability since

<<<

 the beginning of 2000. The low interest rate environment has become the new normal for the P&C insurance industry, producing lower rates of return on insurers' investment portfolios. As a result, the industry's focus on underwriting profitability

<<<

 has, in general, increased during the past years and at the same time competition remains intense in all markets. The If Group also commands a strong position in the Baltic insurance markets with an overall market share of approximately 14

<<<

 per cent.. The If Group is the largest player in the relatively consolidated Estonian P&C insurance market with a market share of 26.8 per cent4. In the more fragmented Latvian and Lithuanian markets, the If Group is the fourth and fifth largest

<<<

 player respectively with a market share of 10.0 per cent. in Latvia and 7.4 per cent. in Lithuania5. During 2011 the If Group decided to leave the Russian insurance market for private individuals. In 2015 the If Group decided to stop writing

<<<

 direct insurance in Russia for Nordic corporate customers and instead offers insurance solutions through its network of international partners.

The If Group conducts its business on a pan-Nordic basis and its operations are divided into the

<<<

 Private, Commercial and Industrial business areas with the operations in the Baltic countries constituting a separate business area within the If Group. Reporting and management are conducted and organised by business area divisions (as set

<<<

 out below) rather than based on legal structure. The If Group's corporate functions such as IT, Human Resources, Communications, Internal Audit and Risk Management are also organised on a Nordic regional basis (rather than based on the legal

<<<

 structure). The chart below outlines the current operational structure of the If Group:

 are, within the framework of the If Group's investment policy, outsourced to Sampo plc in accordance with asset management agreements between the If Group and Sampo plc valid since 2009. The latest agreement came into force on 1 January 20

<<<

16. Allocation of investment assets is based on the overall risk appetite, risk tolerance, regulatory requirements, rating targets and the nature of the Technical Provisions. The If Group's investment portfolio should at all times comply with

<<<

 the investment policy. The investment policy prescribes restrictions, limitations and the decision making structure in respect of
- 63-

different investment classes, which Sampo plc must observe when managing the If Group's investment assets

. Sampo plc undertakes to comply with and is responsible for ensuring that internal and external sub-managers comply with all restrictions, limitations, rules and regulations stated in the investment policy.

The market value of the If Group

<<<

's investment assets as at 31 December 2015 was SEK 104,715 million (excluding currency derivatives). The mark-to-market return for 2015 amounted to SEK 1,714 million, corresponding to a return on investments of 1.5 per cent. In the annual report

<<<

 income statement, which excludes changes in unrealised gains/losses, the investment return amounted to SEK 3,184 million and the return was 2.8 per cent. Unrealised losses amounting to SEK 1,470 million were recognised directly in shareholders

' equity, through changes in the fair value reserve. As at 31 December 2015 the fair value reserve amounted to SEK 3,593 million, decreasing from SEK 4,764 million as at 31 December 2014.

The If Group's equity portfolios increased in value

<<<

 during 2015 and the return for the asset class as a whole was 11.9 per cent. The return on the If Group's portfolio of fixed-income assets was 0.3 per cent.

The average duration of fixed-income assets was 1.2 years at year-end 2015.

The equity

<<<

 weight (including derivative instruments) increased mainly due to higher market values from 12.1 per cent. to 13.4 per cent. as at 31 December 2015 compared with 31 December 2014. The proportion of fixed income investments as a proportion of

<<<

 the If Group's total investment portfolio decreased correspondingly from 87.7 per cent. as at 31 December 2014 to 86.4 per cent. as at 31 December 2015. The real estate weight of 0.2 per cent. was unchanged during 2015. As of 31 December 2

 occurred, so it is also necessary to set aside provisions for claims not yet paid. The technical provisions are the sum of provisions for premiums not yet earned and provisions for claims not yet paid. Technical provisions include an inherent

<<<

 degree of uncertainty as such provisions represent an estimate of the size and the frequency of future claims payments. The uncertainty of technical provisions is normally greater for new portfolios for which complete run-off statistics are

The If Group's gross technical provisions as at 31 December 2015 were SEK 86,687 million. Adjusted for exchange rate effects in the conversion of provisions made in foreign currencies, the level of gross provisions increased by

<<<

 SEK 2,541 million in 2015. Exchange-rate effects decreased the gross technical provisions by SEK 2,111 million. The If Group's technical provisions are, with the exception of provisions covering annuities and annuity IBNR (incurred but not

 reported) in Finland, reported with undiscounted values in the IFRS accounts.

Reinsurance is bought to minimise the If Group's risk and is the portion of risk underwritten by another insurer. The proportion of technical provisions held by

The duration of the provisions, and thus the sensitivity to changes in interest rates, varies with each product portfolio. The weighted average duration for 2015 across all product portfolios was 6.3 years.

Anticipated

<<<

 movements in inflation are taken into account when calculating all such provisions and are of particular importance for claims settled over a long period of time. The anticipated trend is calculated based on external assessments of the movements

<<<

 in inflation in various areas, such as the consumer price index and payroll index, combined with the If Group's own evaluation of cost increases for various types of claims cost.
Risk management approach

The risk management function is centralised

<<<

 within the If Group. The If Group's risk management approach is to ensure that sufficient returns are obtained for the risks taken in all business transactions. All risks are taken into account in risk-return considerations and pricing decisions

<<<

.

The key objectives of risk management are to ensure that the If Group has sufficient capital in relation to the entirety of the risks involved in its business activities and to limit fluctuations in the financial results of the Issuer and

<<<

 the If Group as a whole. This requires all risks to be properly identified, monitored and reported.

The acceptable level of risk is determined by the availability of capital and the selected risk tolerance. Risk management activities are performed

<<<

 in each business unit as part of the normal course of day-today business within parameters which are set by the Board of Directors (the "Board" such term including, for the purposes of If P&C Insurance AS only, the Supervisory Board) of each

<<<

 company within the If Group.

- 66-

Risk governance and Reporting structure
The Board of Directors of each company within the If Group has overall responsibility for the risk management process and is the ultimate decision-making body. The

<<<

 Board ensures that the management and follow-up of risks are satisfactory, monitors risk reports and approves risk management plans.
Risk management governance framework
Each Board is responsible for ensuring the proper functioning and organisation

<<<

 of the If Group's business. The Board is also the corporate body which has overall responsibility for areas such as internal control and risk control and for ensuring the If Group has appropriate risk management systems and processes in place

<<<

.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer (the "CEO") is responsible for organising and overseeing the daily business activities of the each company within the If Group (including risk management) in accordance with the instructions and guidelines

<<<

 of the Board.
The Board has established a Risk Management Framework (the "Framework"), which consists of the strategies, governance, processes, requirements, activities and reporting procedures which are implemented at all levels of the If

<<<

 Group in order to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report risks in line with the Board's strategic objectives.
The objective of the Framework is to create value for the If Group's stakeholders by securing its longterm solvency, minimising

<<<

 the risk of unexpected financial loss and providing input to business decisions by taking into account the effect on risk and capital. The Framework seeks to ensure that all defined risk types are thoroughly assessed, followed-up and properly

<<<

 reported to the Board and the CEO.
As part of the Framework, policies have been implemented for each identified risk area which specify the applicable risk reporting requirements and the restrictions and limits chosen to reflect that risk area

<<<

. These restrictions and limits have been set to ensure that the risk level at all times complies with the overall risk appetite and capital adequacy constraints of the If Group.
The Board actively engages in risk management and follows up identified

<<<

 risks by (i) requesting from the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Committee (the "ORSAC") and applicable business divisions, any additional information it requires in order to make decisions in relation to risk management, (ii) engaging in

<<<

 regular follow up reporting in accordance with the If Group's internal policies and instructions, and (iii) conducting reviews to effect any required changes to the Framework and/or risk management policies of the If Group.
The Framework includes

<<<

 processes and activities performed by persons engaged in the daily business operations of the If Group as well as specialist functions, who report through sub-committees to the ORSAC, which in turn reports to the Chief Risk Officer (the "CRO

<<<

"), who in turn, reports to the Boards and the CEOs.
The CRO is responsible for coordinating risk management on behalf of the Boards, the CEOs and the ORSAC within the Risk Management Framework.
ORSAC
The ORSAC is a forum for assessing the risks

<<<

 of the If Group on a holistic basis. The ORSAC was constituted to review risk systems and processes within the business, coordinate efforts and actions relating to inter alia risk management, supervision of the If Group's overall risk position

<<<

, provide input on the risk management processes of the If Group and follow up on actions and organisational issues related to risk management. The risk reporting from the ORSAC provides a view of the If Group's risk position (taking into account

<<<

 the restrictions and limits set under the Framework) relative to the capital position of the If Group.
Committees reporting to the ORSAC
There are various risk committees in place for specific defined risk areas of the business which consist

<<<

 of the Underwriting Committee, the Investment Control Committee, the Actuarial Committee, the Operational Risk Committee, the Ethics Committee, the Internal Model Committee, the Remuneration
- 67-

Committee, the Reinsurance Committee and

<<<

 the Reinsurance Security Committee. These risk committees have the responsibility of ensuring that risks are handled and controlled as decided by the Board as well as forwarding risk reporting to the ORSAC. The risk committees also monitor

<<<

 the effectiveness of policies and give input to changes and updates if needed.

The committee structure of the If Group (together with the coordinator structure) ensures that all material risks are monitored and reported in a clear and consistent

<<<

 way. It also ensures that the information is sourced from the business area exposed to the risk and is forwarded to control units as well as to the relevant committee.
Capital management

Risk management focuses on both capital efficiency and

<<<

 maintaining the capital resources of the If Group and its subsidiaries at an appropriate level in relation to the risks taken. At a minimum, this means ensuring that the available capital exceeds capital requirements which are set according

<<<

 to requirements of third parties such as regulators and rating agencies.
Capital management approach

One purpose of capital is to act as a buffer against future losses. It is therefore appropriate to define risk in terms of capital. The starting

<<<

 point for capital management is the risk tolerance implemented through a framework of risk limits, policies and authorisations, approved by the Board. Risks are continuously monitored and the implications of such risks on the available capital

<<<

 of the If Group and its subsidiaries are assessed. The risk exposures, required capital and available capital are reported to the ORSAC and the Board on a quarterly basis by the CRO, or more often if the situation so requires. The policy of

<<<

 the If Group, in addition to maintaining capital resources at a sufficient level, is to:



retain at least a single "A" (or equivalent) rating (from each of Standard & Poor's and Moody's);



ensure that risk buffers ­ in the form of capital

<<<

 and foreseeable profitability ­ are adequate in

relation to the current risks inherent in its business activities and existing market environment;



maintain a sustainable dividend capacity;



manage the debt-to-equity ratio in order to

<<<

 enhance returns to shareholders while maintaining

sufficient financial flexibility;



support growth in profitable businesses by allocating capital efficiently; and



ensure the overall efficiency, security and continuity of operations.

<<<



Capital position and Solvency

The If Group monitors its capital position by reference to the relationship between available capital and required capital. To fulfil the differing requirements of various third parties (including but not limited

<<<

 to, regulators and rating agencies), the If Group uses different measures to describe its capital position, namely regulatory measures, internal capital measures and rating agency measures.
Regulatory measures

The Solvency II Directive, implemented

<<<

 on 1 January 2016, introduces a regulatory framework where solvency capital requirements and own funds are risk-based and based on economic valuation principles. Due to the rules related to group supervision within Solvency II, the group solvency

<<<

 capital requirement is calculated at the level of the Sampo Group. From a regulatory point of view, as at the date of this Prospectus the If Group is not supervised as a group under Solvency II and hence solvency capital requirements are only

<<<

 subject to regulatory supervision on a solo level with respect to each operating insurance company within the If Group. However, the balance sheet and operations of the If Group contribute significantly to the consolidated group solvency capital

<<<

 requirement at the Sampo Group level. As of 1 January 2016 the standard formula including the equity transitional rule is applied for all subsidiaries of the If Group in calculating their solvency capital requirements and minimum capital requirements

<<<

. The equity transitional rule allows for applying a lower equity charge for equities bought before the introduction of Solvency II on 1 January 2016.

- 68-

All operating insurance companies within the If Group met their regulatory minimum

<<<

 Solvency I capital requirements during 2015 and met the regulatory solvency capital requirements under Solvency II as of 1 January 2016, 30 June 2016 and as of 30 September 2016. The solvency position is reported quarterly to the supervisory

<<<

 authorities.

As a measure of capital adequacy, the table below shows the standard formula based solvency capital requirement for the If Group, corresponding to what would be the regulatory requirement if Solvency II group rules were enforced

<<<

 at the If Group level. Until September 2016, Topdanmark's solo own funds and solvency capital requirement were included in the overall If Group solvency calculation using the deduction and aggregation method.

Risk and capital modelling and Internal capital measures

In order to assess the overall risk profile, it is necessary to consider the interrelationships between the various types of risk the If Group faces, as some of the risks

<<<

 may develop in opposite directions creating natural hedges. For this purpose, the If Group has used an internal model for several years. The internal model is used for internal risk management only, and covers both the If Group and all material

<<<

 subsidiaries. The internal model covers the risks related to the insurance and investment operations of the If Group.

Through simulations of both investment and insurance operations, the effect of, for example, reinsurance structure and investment

<<<

 allocations can be analysed simultaneously.

In addition to the calculation of the overall capital need, the internal model is also used as a basis for decisions regarding:



allocation of capital to the various business areas in order to

<<<

 achieve consistent profit targets

throughout the If Group;



minimum and maximum weightings for each investment class, to be used as reference in the

investment policy; and



the retention level which affects purchase of the If Group's

<<<

 reinsurance.

Rating agency measures

The rating agencies have their own models which are used to assess the capital position of the If Group. Due to the If Group's rating objective (to maintain an "A" insurance financial strength rating at

<<<

 its operating companies), meeting the capital standards set by the rating agencies is also a key capital requirement.

The If Group's main operating companies, If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) and If P&C Insurance Company Ltd, have financial strength

<<<

 ratings from S&P and Moody's Investors Service Limited ("Moody's"), with a rating of "A+ (stable outlook)" since 2016 for S&P and "A2" since 2004 (positive outlook since 2015), for Moody's. Moody's is established in the EEA and registered under

<<<

 the CRA Regulation and appears on the latest update of the list of registered credit rating agencies (as of 31 December 2015) on the ESMA website http://www.esma.europa.eu).

As of 31 December 2015, S&P's insurance capital model showed a diversified

<<<

 target capital of SEK 28,101 million (based on an "A" rating) and total adjusted capital of SEK 31,750 million for the If Group. As of 30 September 2016, the diversified target capital was SEK 28,492 million (based on an "A" rating) compared

<<<

 to a total adjusted capital of SEK 35,735 million.
Personnel

The average number of employees of the If Group in 2015 was 6,176. As at 31 December 2015 the number of employees of the Issuer was 1.
Applied accounting principles

Financial statements

<<<

 presented for the Issuer are prepared in accordance with Swedish laws and regulations. The If Group has prepared its consolidated accounts in accordance with international accounting standards (IFRS including IAS, SIC and IFRIC), as adopted

<<<

 by the European Commission. In addition, the If Group applies the supplementary provisions ensuing from legislation, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and general recommendations as well as appropriate parts of recommendations

<<<

 issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. For the fiscal year 2015 and for the first half of 2016, the Issuer's and the If Group's accounting presentation was not subject to any significant amendments or new regulations as compared with

<<<

 the fiscal year 2014.

REGULATION
If Group
Set forth below is a summary of

<<<

 certain material information concerning the regulatory and supervisory environment of the insurance business conducted by the If Group. This description is a summary of certain legal issues and does not purport to be complete.
Supervision
The

<<<

 insurance companies within the If Group are subject to regulation in all countries in which they operate. The Swedish insurance companies are licensed and supervised by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw. Finansinspektionen) (

<<<

"SFSA"). The Financial Supervisory Authority in Finland (Fi. Finanssivalvonta) ("FinFSA") is responsible for the supervision of If P&C Insurance Company Ltd (Finland) and the Financial Supervision Authority in Estonia (Es. Finantsinspektsioon

<<<

) is responsible for the supervision of If P&C Insurance AS, its branches in Latvia and Lithuania and its subsidiaries. The If Group operates its cross-border activities through branches of If P&C Insurance Ltd (publ) in Denmark, Finland, France

<<<

, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the SFSA is responsible for the financial supervision of such branch activities. The operations must, however, still be in compliance with the laws of the countries where

<<<

 the branches operate in respect of activities such as marketing, consumer protection, insurance contract requirements and data protection.
The Issuer is a Swedish insurance holding company and is as such not a licensed company. There are however

<<<

 certain rules of the Swedish Insurance Business Act (Sw. försäkringsrörelselag (2010:2043)) and the Solvency II regulation directly applicable to the Issuer's business.
European Union regulatory framework
The European Union ("EU") has adopted

<<<

 legislation with a view to harmonising the member states' regulation of the insurance industry, thus creating a single European market in this respect. This was to a large extent achieved through the adoption of the third generation of insurance

<<<

 directives in 1992. These EU directives have been implemented in the countries where the insurance companies within the If Group are licensed. Through the adoption of the 1992 EU directives, the single passport principle was established in

<<<

 the insurance business. Accordingly, a licence from a competent authority in a member state (the "home supervisory authority") is valid throughout the European Economic Area ("EEA"). A licensed company may carry out its business within the

<<<

 EEA directly or through branches, without any further requirements for authorisations in the countries concerned.
Furthermore, these directives also provided for minimum requirements for life and non-life insurance companies, especially in

<<<

 relation to capitalisation levels (today often referred to as the Solvency I regime). Insurance companies had to ensure that they were able to meet the obligations under their insurance contracts at any given time. They were also required to

<<<

 maintain a level of their own funds equal to or in excess of the solvency margin, which was based on the particular insurance company's business volume.
Solvency II Directive
As of 1 January 2016, the EU has adopted a full-scale revision of

<<<

 the solvency framework and prudential regime applicable to insurance, reinsurance companies and insurance groups known as "Solvency II". The Solvency II framework replaces previous life, non-life, reinsurance and insurance groups directives

<<<

. Member States were required to implement the new rules on 1 April 2015. The regime became binding on insurers and reinsurers within each Member State from 1 January 2016.
The main aim of the Solvency II framework is to ensure the financial

<<<

 stability of the insurance industry across the EU and protect policyholders through establishing solvency requirements better matched to the true risks of the business. Solvency II adopts a three-pillar approach as adopted in the banking sector

<<<

 in Europe. These pillars are quantitative requirements (Pillar 1); qualitative requirements (Pillar 2); and supervisory and reporting disclosure (Pillar 3).
With Solvency II, economic risk-based solvency requirements across all Member States

<<<

 of the EU has been introduced for the first time. While Solvency I included a relatively simple solvency formula based
- 73-

on technical provisions and insurance premiums, Solvency II introduced a new 'total balance sheet' type and risk

<<<

-based regime where insurers' material risks and their interactions are considered.

Under Pillar 1 of Solvency II, insurers are required to hold own funds equal to or in excess of a solvency capital requirement (SCR). Solvency II rules categorise

<<<

 own funds into three tiers with differing qualifications as eligible available regulatory capital. Under Solvency II, basic own funds are derived from the solvency balance sheet in which the undertaking's assets and liabilities are valued in

<<<

 accordance with the Solvency II regulations. The basic own funds consist of the positive difference between assets and liabilities (including technical provisions), which are reduced by the amount of own shares held. In addition, qualifying

<<<

 subordinated liabilities are also included in basic own funds. A basic principle of Solvency II is that assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of their economic value. This is the price which an independent party would pay or receive

<<<

 for acquiring the assets or liabilities. The SCR is a riskbased capital requirement which will be determined using either the standard formula (set out in level 2 implementing measures), or, where approved by the relevant supervisory authority

<<<

, an internal model, or a mixture of both methods (partial internal model). A breach in SCR triggers first level intervention in the supervision of the entity's solvency. In addition to the SCR requirement, there is also the minimum capital

<<<

 requirement (MCR) which intends to reflect a level of own funds that, where breached, triggers ultimate supervisory action, which may involve a transfer of the entity's liabilities to another issuer, withdrawal of its license or liquidation

<<<

 of its in-force business.

Under Pillar 2 of Solvency II, requirements for insurance companies include requirements to:



have effective governance systems in place, proportionate to their business;



meet specific requirements regarding

<<<

 risk management, internal controls, data quality controls,

internal audit functions, internal actuarial functions and control over outsourcing arrangements;



ensure that the directors and officers of insurance companies have the required

<<<

 professional

qualifications and expertise;



integrate effective risk management systems, including strategies, processes and reporting

procedures, in order to monitor, manage and report risk exposures;



conduct an own risk and solvency

<<<

 assessment ("ORSA") on a regular basis; and



be effectively supervised by the National Competent Authorities.

Under Pillar 3 of Solvency II, extensive and frequent reporting to supervisory authorities, and additional external reporting,

<<<

 is required.

As of 1 January 2016, each individual insurance company within the If Group is subject to the Solvency II requirements.
Insurance Distribution Directive

On 23 February 2016, a new directive on insurance distribution ("IDD") entered

<<<

 into force in the EU. Member States have 24 months to transpose its provisions into national law and by 23 February 2018, insurance distributors will be required to comply with the new rules. The IDD will extend the scope of the current Insurance

<<<

 Mediation Directive to cover direct sales by insurance and reinsurance companies without the use of an intermediary. Key features are, among others, mandatory disclosure requirements regarding remuneration, obliging insurers to disclose to

<<<

 their customers the nature of remuneration they receive. Further, insurers will be required to comply with information and disclosure requirements and certain conduct of business rules including a general obligation to act honestly, fairly

<<<

 and professionally in accordance with customers' best interests. In the case of the sale of bundled products, for instance, the insurance company will have to inform customers about the possibility to purchase the components of the package

<<<

 separately and about the costs of each component when purchased separately. In addition, IDD sets out stricter requirements on remuneration of sales staff and introduces a mandatory product oversight and governance process for assessing the

<<<

 suitability of insurance products for customers.

Sampo Group
Insurance groups and financial conglomerates
In October 1998, the EU adopted a directive (98/78/EC) on the supplementary supervision of insurance undertakings within insurance

<<<

 groups otherwise known as the Solvency I Directive. These rules have been further amended and succeeded by Solvency II. The rules impose among other things, group reporting including reporting of group solvency, supervision of intra-group transactions

<<<

, risk concentrations and governance on a group level. Furthermore, own funds and SCR are calculated on a group level. The Solvency II group definition includes an insurance company, its subsidiaries and associated insurance companies in which

<<<

 the group owns at least 20 per cent. of the share capital or the votes as well as its ultimate parent undertaking, which is an insurance holding undertaking, mixed activity insurance holding company, a mixed financial holding company or a foreign

<<<

 insurer established outside the EEA and the consolidated group will also include any subsidiaries and associated companies of such ultimate parent undertaking. In addition to the reports that each insurance company needs to submit, several

<<<

 of the Pillar 3 reporting requirements also apply to the level of the group (including the ORSA report and the annual narrative reports such as the Solvency and Financial Condition Report) and these need to be submitted to the group supervisor

<<<

. In the event that a group operates in several Member States, a group supervisor shall be appointed among the relevant financial supervisory authorities to be responsible for the coordination and exercise of the supplementary supervision. Representatives

<<<

 of the relevant financial supervisory authorities will participate in a college of supervisors to supervise the group. The ultimate parent of the Issuer is Sampo plc. In line with this, group rules in Solvency II are applicable at the Sampo

<<<

 Group level. This includes group supervision and group solvency assessment including the calculation of group SCR, minimum consolidated group SCR, and group own funds. Furthermore, the SFSA has not made an application to apply any of the group

<<<

 provisions at Swedish subgroup level. As of the date of this Prospectus, from a regulatory point of view, the effect of this is that the If Group is not required to calculate group own funds and SCR at a sub-group level. As of 1 July 2015,

<<<

 the Fin-FSA has taken over the responsibility as group supervisor of the Sampo Group under Solvency II.
In 2002 the EU adopted Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision

<<<

 of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate (the "Conglomerate Directive"). The Conglomerate Directive introduced specific legislation for the supplementary supervision of financial groups

<<<

 that provide cross-sectoral services, typically banking and insurance services. A supervisory authority shall be the coordinator in respect of each conglomerate and shall be responsible for the supplementary supervision of the conglomerate

<<<

. In case there are several competent supervisory authorities, one of the home supervisory authorities shall act as coordinator of the conglomerate. The supervision would include regular meetings with the representatives of conglomerates, receipt

<<<

 of solvency reports, risk concentrations and internal transactions and other requested reports regarding the conglomerate, which would include an assessment as to whether the capital of the conglomerate is adequate having regard to risk concentrations

<<<

 and internal transactions etc. The assessment would also include the structure of the conglomerate, its organisation and internal control systems. With Nordea Bank AB as its associated company, the Sampo Group has, since 31 December 2009 been

<<<

 classified as a financial conglomerate under the Finnish Act on the Supervision of Financial and Insurance Conglomerates (2004/699).
As of 1 January 2016, the Sampo Group is hence subject to regulatory group capital requirements as stipulated

<<<

 by the Solvency II Directive as well as by the Conglomerate Directive.

TAXATION Swedish Taxation The following summary outlines certain Swedish tax consequences relating to Noteholders. The summary is based on the laws of Sweden as

<<<

 currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only. The summary does not address, inter alia, situations where the Notes are held in an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto), the tax consequences following

<<<

 variation or substitution (instead of redemption) of the Notes or the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers of interest. Further, the summary does not address credit of foreign taxes. Investors should consult their

<<<

 professional tax advisers regarding the Swedish tax and other tax consequences (including the applicability and effect of tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation) of acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes in their particular

<<<

 circumstances. Holders not tax resident in Sweden Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to the holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax, provided that

<<<

 such a holder (i) is not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and (ii) does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are effectively connected. Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed

<<<

 on payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes, except for certain payments of interest (and other return on Notes) to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual

<<<

) who is resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes (see "Holders tax resident in Sweden" below). Holders tax resident in Sweden In general, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) with residence

<<<

 in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, all capital income (for example, income that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on Notes) will be taxable. Specific tax consequences may be applicable to certain categories

<<<

 of corporations, for example, life insurance companies. Moreover, specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder of Notes realises a capital loss on the Notes. If amounts that are deemed as interest for Swedish

<<<

 tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in Sweden, including a Swedish branch, to a private individual (or the estate of a deceased individual) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally

<<<

 withheld by the legal entity on such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes should normally also be withheld on other returns on Notes (but not capital gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to above

<<<

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
"Claims Ratio" means the total sum of claims incurred on own account including claims-adjustment costs in relation to Premiums Earned on

<<<

 own account, expressed as a percentage.
"Combined Ratio" means the total sum of claims incurred and operating expenses on own account in insurance operations in relation to Premiums Earned on own account, expressed as a percentage.
"Cost Ratio

<<<

" means the total sum of Operating Expenses in Insurance Operations on own account and claims-adjustment costs in relation to Premiums Earned on own account, expressed as a percentage. For further detail, see the Notes to the income statement

<<<

 entitled "Business Area Private", "Business Area Commercial", "Business Area Industrial" and "Business Area Baltic", respectively, in the Issuer's Annual Report 2015.
"Deductible" means the part of the claims amount that the insured must account

<<<

 for himself, in accordance with the insurance terms, and which is thus deducted from insurance compensation. Special deductibles exist in certain types of insurance, whereby a distinction is made between compulsory and voluntary deductibles

<<<

. The latter leads to a reduction in the premium.
"Direct Insurance" means insurance business that relates to contracts concluded between insurers and the insured. The insurance company is directly responsible in relation to the insured.
"Duration

<<<

" has different definitions within the asset management and insurance operations.
Within asset management, duration is the same as the interest-rate risk and denotes how sensitive a fixedincome portfolio is to changes in average interest-rates

<<<

. Duration may be expressed as number of years, in which case it shows the weighted average maturity of the portfolio, meaning the remaining until invested capital plus interest is returned to the investor.
Within insurance operations, duration

<<<

 represents the period that starts when an insurance contract becomes effective and ends when it expires.
"Expense Ratio" means Operating Expenses in Insurance Operations on own account in relation to net Premiums Earned, expressed as a percentage

<<<

.
"Gross Premiums Written" means the total premiums received during the financial year or taken up as a receivable at the end of the year. In contrast to premiums earned, premiums written are not capitalised (i.e. they are unaffected by opening

<<<

 and closing provisions for unearned premiums).
"Insurance Margin" means the Technical Result less other technical income and other operating expense in relation to Premiums Earned on own account, expressed as a percentage.
"Investment Assets

<<<

" means assets that resemble a capital investment, including real estate and securities, such as shares and participations, bonds and other interest-bearing securities, cash and bank, loans and derivatives, excluding all investments in associated

<<<

 companies.
"Investment Result in Income Statement" means Investment Result Mark to Market excluding unrealised changes in fair value of real estate, shares and participations and interest-bearing securities.
"Investment Return in Income statement

<<<

" means Investment Result in Income Statement in relation to the average investment assets, expressed as a percentage. The return has been calculated using a daily time-weighted return (TWR) calculation method used internally by If for evaluation

<<<

 of asset management.
"Investment Result Mark to Market" means net of following income and costs: interest income/expense, dividend shares and participations, surplus/deficits from own properties, realised and unrealised changes in fair value

<<<

 of real estate, shares and participations and interest-bearing securities, and exchange-rate gains/losses. Result pertaining to associated companies is not included. If recognises the main part of unrealised value changes on shares and participations

<<<

 and interest-bearing securities in other comprehensive income.
"Investment Return Mark to Market" means "Investment Result Mark to Market" in relation to the average investment assets, expressed as a percentage. The return has been calculated

<<<

 using a daily time-
- 81-

weighted return (TWR) calculation method used internally by If for evaluation of asset management. TWR is a measure consisting of sub-periods returns linked geometrically (compounded) together and are often used

<<<

 by asset managers because this method eliminates effects from external cash flows.
"Net Premiums Written" means Gross Premiums Written less ceded reinsurance premiums.
"Operating Expenses in Insurance Operations" means expenses related to the

<<<

 acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts plus corporate administration costs.
"Operating Result" means profit/loss before appropriations and taxes.
"Premiums Earned" means that portion of gross premiums written that pertains to the fiscal

<<<

 year, meaning premiums written adjusted for changes in the provision for unearned premiums.
"Reinsurance" means a method of distributing risks whereby an insurance company purchases coverage for a part of its liability based on insurance or

<<<

 reinsurance contracts, so-called ceded reinsurance. Reinsurance accepted pertains to the business one insurance company accepts from other insurance companies in the form of reinsurance.
"Retention" means the highest insured or claims amount

<<<

 relating to the same risk that an insurer retains for its own account, meaning without reinsurance.
"Return on Equity" means the result for the year, adjusted for unrealised gains and losses on investments assets recognised in other comprehensive

<<<

 income, less full tax in relation to average shareholders' equity.
"Reserve Ratio" means the provision for claims outstanding for own account in relation to either (i) paid claims for own account ("Reserve ratio vs. paid claims") or, (ii) in

<<<

 relation to premiums written for own account ("Reserve ratio vs. written premiums") expressed as a percentage. In these ratios, paid claims and written premiums are computed for the last 12 months ("R12 basis"). In order to eliminate the effects

<<<

 of currency emanating from different currency principles in the balance sheet and the income statement, paid claims and net written premiums are recalculated using closing rates when computing the ratios.
"Risk Ratio" means the total sum of

<<<

 insurance claims on own account, excluding claims-adjustment costs, in relation to Premiums Earned on own account, expressed as a percentage.
"Risk Selection" means the insurer's intentional selection of the type of risks to be included in
