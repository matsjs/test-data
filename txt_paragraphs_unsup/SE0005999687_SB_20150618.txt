1. BACKGROUND
On 27 April 2015, Solør

<<<

 Bioenergi Holding AS (the "NOK Issuer") a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer released a press release in relation to recognition of income related to excess values from acquisitions made in 2014.
The press release was a result of extensive

<<<

 reviews, where the Issuer's auditor concluded that the acquisitions of Rindi Energi AB and the E.ON portfolio in 2014, in their opinion, did not qualify for recognition of excess values based on a "bargain purchase" approach under IFRS. Consequently

<<<

, the financial statements for 2014 for both the NOK Issuer and the Issuer will be corrected and the income recognition of excess value amounting to SEK 891 million will be reversed. This reversal requires an accounting process that will delay

<<<

 the publication of audited annual accounts for 2014 originally scheduled for 30 April 2015.
Additionally, the reversal of recognized income will lead to covenant breaches under both the Terms and Conditions and the terms and conditions for

<<<

 the NOK 650 million bonds issued by the NOK Issuer. These covenant breaches are only temporary, and relate mainly to accounting treatment, and will in the Issuer's opinion not affect the Group's underlying operations, cash flow, debt servicing

<<<

 ability, or credit quality going forward.
For further information about the Group's full year results ending 31 December 2014 and preliminary first quarter results ending 31 March 2015, please see the company presentation attached hereto as

<<<

 Schedule 3 (the "Company Presentation").
As a result of the above, the Issuer is unable to comply with the financial covenants "Equity Ratio", "Current Ratio" and "Interest Coverage Ratio" set out in Clause 12.4 (Financial Covenants) in the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions. In addition, the Issuer is in technical breach of a certain provision in the Terms and Conditions and the Issuer may not be able to meet certain reporting requirements within the relevant timeframes (as further described

<<<

 in Clause 4 (Waivers) below). The waivers that will be required in respect of the defaults and anticipated defaults referred to herein, are together referred to as the "Waivers", and are further described under Clause 4 (Waivers) below.
Furthermore

<<<

, the Issuer is contemplating a reorganisation of its holding company structure in order to obtain a more efficient and manageable structure which will allow for a more efficient administration and future growth (the "Reorganisation"). For the

<<<

 purpose of the Reorganisation, the Issuer will require certain consents from the Bondholders. The Reorganisation is further described under Clause 2 (Reorganisation) below.

3 (25)
Moreover, in connection with the preparations for the Reorganisation

<<<

, the Issuer and its legal advisers has conducted a thorough review of the Terms and Conditions and the corresponding documentation for its other debt instruments. The purpose of the review has been to ensure that the Group may continue to operate

<<<

 and grow its business in line with the Group's strategy. As a result of the review, certain technical and minor items have been identified that will need to be catered for in order to provide the expected flexibility (the "Amendments"). The

<<<

 Amendments are further described under Clause 3 (Amendments to the Terms and Conditions) below.
The purpose of this Notice is to obtain the Bondholders' consent to the Waivers, the Reorganisation and the Amendments.
2. Reorganisation
2.1 Background

<<<

 to the Reorganisation
The Issuer is currently assessing and preparing for the Group's long term strategy and operations of the Group. As part of the assessment, the Issuer has together with its advisers reviewed the holding company structure

<<<

 within the Group. The review has indicated that the current structure impose certain unexpected restrictions that will have an adverse effect in achieving the objective of realising operational synergies in combining the Group's business subsequent

<<<

 to the acquisition of Rindi Energi Group and the E.ON portfolio. In addition, the existing structure does not fully facilitate for an efficient day-to-day management of the Group due to the complicated holding company structure.
As a part of

<<<

 the Restructuring, the Issuer is contemplating a change of issuer under the NOK 650 million senior secured bonds issued by the NOK Issuer (the "NOK Bond"), whereby the Issuer becomes the new debtor under the NOK Bond.
The existing structure

<<<

 is set out in figure 1 below and the proposed amended structure is set out in figure 2 below.
Figure 1 ­ Existing Group structure

Figure 2 ­ Proposed amended Group structure

4 (25)

The Reorganisation will be completed through the following

<<<

 steps:
(a) the change of issuer under the NOK Bond whereby the Issuer receives an intercompany claim on the NOK Issuer in an amount equivalent to the outstanding debt (including accrued interest) under the NOK Bond, as further described in

<<<

 Clause 2.2 below;
(b) the acquisition by the Issuer from the NOK Issuer of the shares in the Group Companies listed below, in each case on arm's length terms and with a purchase price equivalent to the fair market value of the relevant entity

<<<

:
(i) SBH Acquisition 2 AB, whereby the NOK Issuer receives an intercompany claim on the Issuer in an amount equivalent to the purchase price of SBH Acquisition 2 AB;
(ii) SBH Acquisition AB, whereby the NOK Issuer receives an intercompany claim

<<<

 on the Issuer in an amount equivalent to the purchase price of SBH Acquisition AB;
(iii) Solør Bioenergi Sverige AB, whereby the NOK Issuer receives an intercompany claim on the Issuer in an amount equivalent to the purchase price of Solør

<<<

 Bioenergi Sverige AB; and
(iv) Solør Bioenergi Recycling AB, whereby the NOK Issuer receives an intercompany claim on the Issuer in an amount equivalent to the purchase price of Solør Bioenergi Recycling AB,
in each case as further described

<<<

 in Clause 2.3 below;
(c) the pledge of all shares held by the Group in SBH Acquisition AB (being the parent company within the Rindi group) as security for the Bonds and the NOK Bond on a pro rata basis, as further described in Clause 2.4 below

<<<

;

5 (25)
(d) the assumption by SBH Acquisition AB of SEK 325.4 million of the debt outstanding under the intercompany loan that originally was made available by the Issuer to the NOK Issuer (in the total amount of approximately SEK 332.7 million

<<<

) (the "NOK Issuer Loan") and, as consideration therefore, the forgiveness by the NOK Issuer of the NOK Issuer's existing loan to SBH Acquisition AB (in the amount of approximately SEK 325.4 million) (the "SBH Loan"); and
(e) potentially, the

<<<

 set-off, contribution in kind or conversion into equity of any intercompany loans that arise as a consequence of the steps set out above.
In order to facilitate the Reorganisation as outlined above, any Intercompany Loans or Material Intercompany

<<<

 Loans (as defined in Clause 0 below) arising as a result of the Reorganisation (the "Relevant Intercompany Loans"), may be reduced or extinguished by way of set-off, contribution in kind or conversion into equity. Such actions are currently

<<<

 not allowed under the Terms and Conditions and the Intercompany Loans Pledge Agreements, entailing that the intercompany balances (both upstream and downstream) that will arise between the Issuer and the NOK Issuer as a consequence of the Reorganisation

<<<

 would be outstanding.
Moreover, as a result of the Reorganisation, a complicated intercompany loan structure would arise whereby the SBH Loan would become a loan between two sister companies. Such loan would not be beneficial for neither the

<<<

 Group nor the Bondholders as it does not provide for a direct upstream of funds for purposes of servicing the Bonds.
The Issuer's request for the Bondholders' consent to the Reorganisation therefore contains a request that each Relevant Intercompany

<<<

 Loan and the NOK Issuer Loan may, notwithstanding the provisions in the Terms and Conditions and in the Intercompany Loans Pledge Agreements, until 31 December 2015, be set-off, contributed in kind, converted into equity and, in the case of

<<<

 the NOK Issuer Loan, be subject to a change of debtor from the NOK Issuer to SBH Acquisition AB.
2.2 Change of issuer under the NOK Bond
In 2012, the NOK Issuer, being a wholly-owned subsidiary to the Issuer, issued the NOK Bond.
For the reasons

<<<

 outlined above and in order to be able to report its financial covenants at the level of the Issuer, the Issuer will assume the NOK Bond and become the new Issuer thereunder. The incurrence of the NOK Bond as debt in the Issuer is explicitly

<<<

 permitted under the Terms and Conditions. However, in consideration of the Issuer assuming the NOK Bond as debt, the Issuer will receive an intragroup claim on the NOK Issuer in an amount of approximately NOK 650 million. The intragroup claim

<<<

 is permitted under the Terms and Conditions but the Issuer has an obligation to grant security over the intragroup claim to the Bondholders. The Issuer is however contemplating to set-off part of this loan against the purchase price claim relating

<<<

 to its acquisition of companies from the NOK Issuer. As a final step of the Reorganisation, it is contemplated that any remaining part of the intragroup claim that has not been set-off may be contributed by the Issuer to the NOK Issuer, which

<<<

 requires consent from the Bondholders.

6 (25)
The bondholders under the NOK Bond will need to give their consent to the change of issuer under the NOK Bond. A waiver process has therefore been initiated under the NOK Bond. The terms and conditions

<<<

 under the NOK Bond will also be amended in order to better correlate to the Terms and Conditions. This will also provide for a more simplified management of the Group as similar terms will apply to both bond loans.
2.3 Acquisition of the shares

<<<

 in SBH Acquisition 2 AB, SBH Acquisition AB, Solør Bioenergi Sverige AB and Solør Bioenergi Recycling AB
As a part of the Reorganisation, and as described under paragraph 2.1 above, the Issuer will acquire all shares issued by each of SBH Acquisition

<<<

 2 AB, SBH Acquisition AB, Solør Bioenergi Sverige AB and Solør Bioenergi Recycling AB from the NOK Issuer. The share transfers will entail that the Issuer becomes the direct shareholder of each holding company in the respective sections of

<<<

 the Group.
The proposed amended structure will give the Group a more efficient structure where funds may be transferred to the Issuer directly from each section of the Group which will provide for a more efficient debt service capability. In

<<<

 particular, the Reorganisation will ensure that funds from the Swedish sections of the Group can be transferred to the Issuer without passing through Solør Bioenergi Holding AS. The proposed amended structure will also entail reduced management

<<<

 and auditing costs for the Group.
2.4 Impact on transaction security
Share security
The shares in SBH Acquisition 2 AB have been pledged as security for the Issuer's obligations under the Bonds. The transfer of the shares in SBH Acquisition

<<<

 2 AB will therefore be made subject to the existing security created under the relevant Share Pledge Agreement. In order to document that the transfer is made subject to the existing security and that the Issuer assumes the NOK Issuer's obligations

<<<

 under the relevant Share Pledge Agreement, the Issuer will enter into a security confirmation letter in connection with the share transfer. The arrangement will ensure that the share transfer does not have an adverse effect on the existing

<<<

 security created over the shares in SBH Acquisition 2 AB.
None of the shares in SBH Acquisition AB, Solør Bioenergi Sverige AB and Solør Bioenergi Recycling AB have been pledged as security for the Issuer's obligations under the Bonds. However

<<<

, the shares in each of Solør Bioenergi Sverige AB and Solør Bioenergi Recycling AB have been pledged as security under the NOK Bond and similar security arrangements as described in the preceding paragraph will therefore be entered into under

<<<

 the NOK Bond.
Intercompany Loan security
The Relevant Intercompany Loans and the Rindi Intercompany Loan (together the "Reorganisation Loans"), shall in accordance with the Terms and Conditions be pledged to the Bondholders. According to the

<<<

 terms of the Intercompany Loans Pledge Agreements under which the Reorganisation Loans have been (or will be) pledged, the Reorganisation Loans may not be set-off, contributed in kind or converted into the

7 (25)
equity. The reason for this

<<<

 restriction is to ensure that the security is validly perfected under Swedish law.
As part of the Reorganisation, there will be a right for the relevant Group Companies to set-off, contribute in kind and convert into equity the Reorganisation

<<<

 Loans until 31 December 2015. This flexibility may entail that the relevant security provider under the relevant Intercompany Loans Pledge Agreements have not been effectively deprived of their rights to dispose of or deal with the Reorganisation

<<<

 Loans. As a consequence, there is a risk that the security created over the Reorganisation Loans will not be deemed valid until 1 January 2016 and that the security will be vulnerable to claw back during a hardening period thereafter. The hardening

<<<

 period is usually three months but could potentially be longer if the security provider is insolvent when the security is perfected.
However, the purpose of the flexibility in relation to the Reorganisation Loans is to provide for a "cleaner

<<<

" intercompany loan structure and the Reorganisation Loans will therefore, to the extent feasible, be set-off, contributed in kind or converted into equity before 1 January 2016 (at which point in time the security over any residual amount under

<<<

 the Reorganisation Loans will be perfected).
New security
As consideration for the Bondholders' granting the waivers and consents requested in this Notice, the Issuer will provide new security over all the shares issued by SBH Acquisition AB

<<<

 once the Reorganisation has been completed (the "Rindi Share Security"). SBH Acquisition AB is the shareholder of 99.91 per cent of the shares in Rindi Energi AB.
The Rindi Share Security will be pledged to the Bondholders and to the bondholders

<<<

 under the NOK Bond (the "NOK Bondholders") on a pro rata basis. The Rindi Share Security will be provided on substantially the following terms (to be documented in a share pledge agreement containing intercreditor provisions):
(a) the security

<<<

 will be held by the Security Agent under the Bonds on behalf of the Bondholders and the bondholders under the NOK Bond and the Security Agent will benefit from substantially similar limitation of liability, rights and protections as under the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions of the Bonds;
(b) the proceeds from an enforcement of the Rindi Share Security will be shared by the Bondholders and the NOK Bondholders pari passu and pro rata, calculated on the total outstanding amount under the respective

<<<

 bond on the date that the security is granted;
(c) each of the agent for the Bondholders (on behalf of the Bondholders) and the trustee for the NOK Bondholders (on behalf of the NOK Bondholders) shall be entitled to initiate enforcement over

<<<

 the Rindi Share Security;
(d) a 40 days' consultation period will apply unless the Bondholders and the NOK Bondholders agree otherwise. If no agreement is reached during the consultation period, the bond with the largest outstanding amount

<<<

 at the time

8 (25)
(represented by the agent/trustee for that bond) has the right to give enforcement instructions to the Security Agent; and
(e) in the case of refinancing of either the Bonds or the NOK Bond, the new debt shall be entitled

<<<

 to share the Rindi Share Security on the same terms as the bond that was refinanced.
3. Amendments to the Terms and Conditions
As set out in the background section to this Notice, the Issuer and its legal advisers have identified certain technical

<<<

 and minor items which need to be amended in the Terms and Conditions. The rationale for the proposed amendments are further described in Clauses 3.1-3.5 below and the explicit amendments of the Terms and Conditions are set out in Clause 0 below

<<<

.
3.1 Intercompany Loans
Pursuant to the Terms and Conditions, the Issuer and the other Obligors have undertaken to pledge all present and future money claims under the Intercompany Loans and the Acquisition Loans. In practice, this entails

<<<

 that the Obligors are required to grant security over any intercompany debt that arises, notwithstanding whether the loan is material or not. In addition, a perfected security over intercompany loans under Swedish law requires that the debtor

<<<

 under the relevant loan is deprived of its rights to repay or prepay the loan to the intercompany creditor. The obligation has proven to have adverse consequences for the Group's day-to-day business as it is not possible for the Group to create

<<<

 any temporary intragroup balances.
The Issuer is therefore proposing an amendment of the Terms and Conditions whereby only material Intercompany Loans are pledged as security for the Bonds. In order to qualify as a material Intragroup Loan

<<<

, the initial principal amount of the loan shall be in excess of SEK 10,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) and a term of no less than 180 calendar days. No materiality threshold will be introduced with respect to Acquisition Loans

<<<

.
With a view to the above request, the Issuer also requests that any Security that has been granted over intragroup loans that are not material Intragroup Loans will be immediately released. The Issuer moreover requests that the relevant Security

<<<

 Documents are amended in order to reflect the materiality threshold for Intragroup Loans.
3.2 Guarantees
The granting of guarantees is regulated by Clause 12.3 (Financial support restrictions) in the Terms and Conditions. This is the customary

<<<

 way to regulate guarantees and it permits guarantees to be granted for Permitted Financial Indebtedness, guarantees for loans between Group Companies and guarantees granted in the ordinary course of business, for example non-financial performance

<<<

 guarantees.
However, granting of guarantees are also regulated by the negative pledge provision in Clause 12.7 (Negative pledge). This type of provision normally only covers granting of

9 (25)
security. There are customary exemptions from

<<<

 the negative pledge restrictions for the granting of Permitted Security, but they mostly concern granting of security and the only permitted guarantees are guarantees in relation to the Finance Documents.
This double-regulation has the effect

<<<

 that the guarantees granted in relation to the NOK Bond and the Existing Rindi Debt, which both were outstanding prior to the issuance of the Bonds, violates the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds. The Issuer propose to rectify these unintended

<<<

 consequences by amending the negative pledge provision so that it only covers granting of security and leave the granting of guarantees to be regulated by Clause 12.3 (Financial support restrictions).
3.3 Mergers and de-mergers
Pursuant to

<<<

 Clause 12.8 (Mergers) and 12.9 (De-mergers), the Group is permitted to merge and de-merge Group Companies provided that such merger or de-merger does not have a Material Adverse Effect. However, the terms of the Security Documents and the Terms

<<<

 and Conditions does not permit a Group Company which either has pledged assets, or whose shares are subject to pledge, to participate in a merger or de-merger.
The above restrictions have proven to have an adverse effect on the Group's ability

<<<

 to make intragroup reorganisations which would otherwise have a positive effect for the Group. The Issuer is therefore requesting that the undertakings regarding mergers and de-mergers are amended so that they do not impose any restrictions

<<<

 on intragroup reorganisations, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled in order to safeguard the security.
3.4 Disposals
Pursuant to Clause 12.11 (Disposal of assets) of the Terms and Conditions, the Group Companies may dispose of

<<<

 assets provided that the disposal is carried out at fair market value, on terms and conditions customary for such transactions and that the transaction would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, according to Clause

<<<

 12.11.4 no Group Company may dispose of any assets (including shares) which are subject to pledge under any Security Document.
The above restrictions have proven to have an adverse effect on the Group's ability to make intragroup reorganisations

<<<

 which would otherwise have a positive effect for the Group. Consequently, the Issuer is proposing that an amendment is made to the Terms and Conditions whereby the Group Companies are allowed to dispose of assets which are subject to pledge

<<<

 to other Group Companies provided that (i) the existing conditions referred to above are satisfied, and (ii) that the disposal of any assets being subject to Security is made subject to the existing pledge under the relevant Security Document

<<<

.
3.5 Financial Covenants
As set out in the Company Presentation, the Issuer may not be able to comply with the Financial Covenants during a limited period of time. The Issuer it therefore proposing an amendment of the Terms and Conditions whereby

<<<

 the Financial Covenants are amended in order to ensure that the updated business case is reflected in the covenant levels. The Issuer has also proposed that an equity cure is introduced in the Terms and Conditions

10 (25)
whereby the sponsors

<<<

 have the right to cure a breach of the Financial Covenants by way of injecting cash into the Issuer. In addition, a calculation adjustment has been introduced to exclude the additional margin and the waiver fee (under both the Bonds and the

<<<

 NOK Bond) from the calculation of the financial covenants.
3.6 Further restrictions and additional Security
In consideration for the extended flexibility provided under the Amendments and Waivers requested by the Issuer, the Issuer agrees to

<<<

 the following further restrictions:
(a) the Issuer will not be permitted to make any Restricted Payments prior to the second consecutive Quarter Date at which the Issuer are in compliance with the original levels of all the Financial Covenants

<<<

;
(b) Financial Indebtedness incurred in connection with a refinancing of the Existing Rindi Debt may not exceed the Financial Indebtedness outstanding under the Existing Rindi Debt at the time of the refinancing (except that the repayment in

<<<

 an amount of SEK 40,000,000 made to Swedbank AB (publ) as part of an ongoing refinancing process with another bank shall, provided that such ongoing refinancing is successfully completed, be added back when determining the permitted refinancing

<<<

 amount), provided that such restriction shall lapse on the Quarter Date at which the Issuer are in compliance with the original levels of all the Financial Covenants;
(c) the Issuer shall provide additional Security in the form of a share pledge

<<<

 over the shares in SBH Acquisition AB, such share pledge to be shared pro rata between the Bonds and the NOK Bonds;
(d) the Issuer will pay an Interest Rate with an Additional Margin subject to a margin ratchet affected by the Equity Ratio

<<<

 and the Interest Coverage Ratio until (but excluding) the Interest Payment date following the Quarter Date when the Equity Ratio is at least 27.5 per cent. and the Interest Coverage Ratio is at least 2.5x occurs, then the Issuer will pay an

<<<

 Interest Rate of STIBOR (3 months) + 5 per cent. per annum; and
(e) until the original Financial Covenants are met, the Issuer will not be permitted to acquire new companies or business unless (i) the Interest Coverage Ratio (calculated on

<<<

 a pro forma basis including the acquired company or business) is at least 2.0x (ii) the Equity Ratio (calculated on a pro forma basis including the acquired company or business) is no less than 22.5 per cent and (iii) such acquisition is financed

<<<

 by at least 30 per cent new cash equity from sources outside of the Group. Furthermore, during such period there shall be no transfer of available cash from the existing part of the Group in relation to such acquisition.

Subject to what is set out above but notwithstanding anything else

<<<

 to the contrary in this Agreement or any Security Document, each Group Company (in this capacity the "De-Merging Entity") may de-merge (a "De-merger"), provided that:
(a) if the De-Merging Entity is an Obligor, each new entity becomes an Obligor

<<<

;
(b) if the shares of the De-Merging Entity is pledged under a Security Document, the shares of each new entity shall be pledged under a Security Document; and
(c) each of the De-Merging Entity, the new entity arising as a consequence of the

<<<

Clause 

<<<

12.11.4 (Disposal of assets)
Assets (including shares) which have been pledged pursuant to the Security Documents may at no point be disposed of as long as such assets remain pledged. The Issuer shall notify the Agent/Security Agent of any such

The waivers and consents referred to under item (a)-(c) above are hereafter jointly referred to as the "Requests".
8. NON-RELIANCE
The Requests are presented to the Bondholders without evaluation or recommendations from the Agent. The

<<<

 Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Requests are acceptable or not.
9. THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE
The following instructions need to be adhered to under the Written Procedure.
9.1 Final date to participate in the Written Procedure

<<<


The Agent must have received the votes by mail, courier or email to the address indicated below no later than 17:00 (CET), 8 July 2015. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.
9.2 Decision procedure
The Agent will determine if received

<<<

 replies are eligible to participate under the Written Procedure as valid votes.
When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent, the Requests shall be deemed to be adopted, even if

<<<

 the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure will: i) be sent by notice to the Bondholders and ii) be published on the websites of a) the Issuer and

<<<

 b) the Agent.
A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Bondholders, irrespective of them responding in the Written Procedure.
9.3 Voting rights and authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure

<<<

 must on the Record Date (24 June 2015) in the debt register:
(a) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities Account; or
(b) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.


<<<

9.4 Bonds registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for

<<<

 the Bonds.

22 (25)
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee

<<<

 or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorization. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorization directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register

<<<

 as bondholder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a Bondholder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct

<<<

 registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries

<<<

, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or

<<<

 need authorization or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights.
9.5 Quorum
To approve the Requests, Bondholders representing at least fifty (50) per

<<<

 cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.
If a quorum does not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not

<<<

 been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure.
9.6 Majority
Two thirds (2/3) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Bondholders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to the

<<<

 Requests.
9.7 Address for sending replies
Return the Voting Form, Schedule 1, and, if applicable, the Power of Attorney/Authorisation in Schedule 2 or other sufficient evidence, if the Bonds are held in custody other than Euroclear Sweden,

<<<
