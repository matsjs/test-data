 Callable Bond Issue 2010/2017
Oslo, 18 October 2010
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING
1. BACKGROUND
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("Norsk Tillitsmann") is appointed bond trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of bonds with ISIN NO 001 0574833 (the

<<<

 "Bonds") issued under the bond agreement dated 14 May 2010 (the "Bond Agreement") with SKDP 1 Ltd. as borrower (the "Issuer").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement unless otherwise

<<<

 stated in this summons.
On 20 September 2010, the Issuer wrote to Norsk Tillitsmann announcing its intention to carry out a sale of the Rig or the shares in SKDP1 Ltd. (the "Proposed Transaction") in connection with a reorganisation of the

<<<

 ownership of the Rig. The Issuer indicated that the Proposed Transaction will constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event, and that the Issuer will make a prepayment and redemption of the Outstanding Bonds upon completion of the Proposed Transaction

<<<

, in accordance with Clause 10.4.1 of the Bond Agreement.
On 1 October 2010, the Issuer took delivery of the Rig from the Yard, and granted a mortgage over the Rig to Norsk Tillitsmann on behalf of the Bondholders.
On 12 October 2010, Norsk

<<<

 Tillitsmann received a request to call for a Bondholders' Meeting from Bondholders holding 55.75% of the Bonds (the "Requesting Bondholders") in accordance with Clause 16.2.2 of the Bond Agreement. In summary, the Requesting Bondholders contest

<<<

 that the Proposed Transaction would constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event, and propose that the Bondholders' Meeting instruct Norsk Tillitsmann to take the appropriate steps to protect the interests of the Bondholders.
The information in

<<<

 this summons regarding the Issuer and other facts, conditions or interpretations are provided by the Requesting Bondholders, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

The Requesting Bondholders note that the original term sheet and information memorandum for the Bonds dated 22 April 2010 provided that there would be a Call Option from the date of issuance to 19 May 2011 at a price of 108% plus accrued interest

<<<

. Following feedback from potential investors, the final terms of the Bond Agreement provided that there would be no Call Option prior to 19 May 2011. This amendment was detailed in slides dated 7 May 2010 which were circulated to potential

<<<

 investors by Pareto Securities AS, as Manager for the issuance of the Bonds, and the Bonds were specifically marketed on this basis.
2. THE REQUESTING BONDHOLDERS' PROPOSAL
The Requesting Bondholders dispute the Issuer's assertions that the

<<<

 Proposed Transaction would constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event (the "Disputed Matters"), including (in summary) for the following reasons.
The Disputed Matters
In its letter of 20 September 2010, the Issuer confirmed that Rowan Companies

<<<

 Inc. ("Rowan") is the owner of 97.06% of the shares of Skeie Drilling & Production ASA (the immediate 100% shareholder of the Issuer), and indicated that the Rig, or the shares in the Issuer, would be transferred to another subsidiary of Rowan

<<<

 based in Gibraltar. It is the position of the Requesting Bondholders that such an intra-group transfer of the Rig to another subsidiary of Rowan would not qualify as a "sale" as such term is used in the definition of a "Mandatory Prepayment

<<<

 Event". Otherwise, this would allow the Issuer to avoid making interest payments on the Bonds from the time of the Mandatory Prepayment to the time when the Bonds first become contractually callable in May 2011 at 107% of par and accrued interest

<<<

 to that date. The net difference between the amounts payable in respect of (i) a Mandatory Prepayment at 108% of par plus accrued interest to the date of such Mandatory Prepayment (the amount of such payment being the "Mandatory Prepayment

<<<

 Amount" and the date of such payment being the "Mandatory Prepayment Date"), and (ii) the redemption of the Bonds on 19 May 2011 at 107% of par and accrued interest from 20 May 2010 to 19 May 2011 (the amount of such payment being the "Redemption

<<<

 Amount") is referred to in this summons as the "Net Difference". By way of illustration, in the event that the Mandatory Prepayment Date were to be 1 November 2010, the Net Difference would be approximately US$11 million.
Clause 13.3.4 of the

<<<

 Bond Agreement prohibits the Issuer from selling or otherwise disposing of all or a substantial part of its assets or operations, unless the Bonds are redeemed in full pursuant to Clause 10.2 (the call option provision which is not currently

<<<

 available to the Issuer) or Clause 10.4 (Mandatory Prepayment) of the Bond Agreement. On the basis that the Proposed Transaction is not a Mandatory Prepayment Event that would require and allow the Issuer to redeem the Bonds pursuant to Clause

<<<

 10.4, the Issuer is not entitled to effectuate the Proposed Transaction without the consent of the Bondholders, which consent has neither been given nor sought.

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
www.m isie e .n o
Pursuant to the Issuer Share Pledge,

<<<

 all the shares in the Issuer have been pledged to Norsk Tillitsmann (in its capacity as security agent on behalf of the Bondholders) as security for the Bonds. Pursuant to the terms of the Issuer Share Pledge, the Parent has agreed not to sell

<<<

, assign, transfer, pledge or encumber, or otherwise dispose of, all or any of the Shares until all the obligations under the Bond Agreement and the Security Documents have been unconditionally and irrevocably paid in full. Thus, any transfer

<<<

 of shares in the Issuer by the Parent would require the prior written consent of Norsk Tillitsmann together with such full repayment.
To the extent that Rowan for administrative, operational, tax or other reasons wishes to transfer the Rig

<<<

 or the shares in the Issuer intra-group, they can do so in compliance with the terms of the Bond Agreement by initiating a covenant defeasance in accordance with Clause 18.2 of the Bond Agreement. Alternatively, they can transfer the Rig or

<<<

 the shares in the Issuer with the consent of the Bondholders. In each case, the position of the Requesting Bondholders is that, prior to 19 May 2011, this would require the Issuer to make provision for the payment in full of the Redemption

<<<

 Amounts, being all amounts that would be payable under the Bonds up to and including the time they first become callable on 19 May 2011. Were there to be defeasance as at 1 November 2010, that amount would be approximately US$238 million, being

<<<

 107% of principal, plus interest for the period from 20 May 2010 to 19 May 2011.
It is proposed that the Bondholders instruct Norsk Tillitsmann (i) not to accept redemption of any Bonds as a Mandatory Prepayment under Clause 10.4 of the Bond

<<<

 Agreement upon a sale of the Rig to a subsidiary or affiliate of Rowan prior to 19 May 2011, (ii) not to give its consent to any transfer of any of the shares in the Issuer to a subsidiary or affiliate of Rowan, and (iii) not to release any

<<<

 Security Interest in each case unless the Issuer makes payment in cash and in full of the Redemption Amount (as described above). However, it is also proposed that the foregoing instructions to Norsk Tillitsmann will not apply in circumstances

<<<

 where an amount equivalent to the Net Difference has been placed into escrow pending the settlement of the Disputed Matters in arbitration proceedings on terms satisfactory to Bondholders holding at least 50% by value of the Bonds (as more

<<<

 fully described in the resolutions below).
Costs and Fees
The Requesting Bondholders and certain other Bondholder have retained legal advisers to assist them with the matters set forth in this summons, namely Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP

<<<

 and Advokatfirmaet Thommessen AS (the "Bondholder Advisers"), and have agreed to meet the costs and expenses of the Bondholder Advisers (the "Legal Fees"). It is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting authorises and instructs Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 to instruct the Issuer and/or Paying Agent to pay the Legal Fees out of but ahead of payments of principal and interest on the Bonds. The effect of this is that the Legal Fees will be borne by all Bondholders.

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA www.tm

<<<

.sii-o.no
In addition, it is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting authorises and instructs Norsk Tillitsmann to instruct the Issuer and/or the Paying Agent to pay to Norsk Tillitsmann an amount equivalent to any legal fees, costs, expenses

<<<

 and other liabilities properly incurred by Norsk Tillitsmann itself in implementing the resolutions proposed by the Requesting Bondholders, out of but ahead of payments of principal and interest on the Bonds (including payments with respect

<<<

 to the Legal Fees), up to a maximum aggregate amount of US$600,000. The effect of this is that such legal fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities which are incurred by Norsk Tillitsmann will be borne by all Bondholders.
It is further proposed

<<<

, in the alternative, that, in circumstances where the Net Difference is placed into an escrow account pending the settlement of the Disputed Matters in arbitration proceedings (as more fully described below), Norsk Tillitsmann shall be authorised

<<<

 and instructed to instruct the Issuer and/or the Paying Agent to pay (i) US$250,000 to Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP on account of Legal Fees, and (ii) US$600,000 to Norsk Tillitsmann in respect of accrued and future legal fees, costs, expenses

<<<

 and other liabilities properly incurred by Norsk Tillitsmann or for which Norsk Tillitsmann is properly responsible in connection with the arbitration proceedings described below, in each case out of the Mandatory Prepayment Amount. Again,

<<<

 the effect of this is that in such circumstances the Legal Fees, and the total legal fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities incurred by Norsk Tillitsmann or for which Norsk Tillitsmann is properly responsible in connection with arbitration

<<<

 proceedings, will be borne by all Bondholders.
Liability
Norsk Tillitsmann points out that were the instructions set out in resolution (a) and (b) below to cause Norsk Tillitsmann and the Bondholders to incur any liability, any loss may be

<<<

 deducted from distribution o f principal, interest, premium or otherwise made to the Bondholders with respect to the Bonds. Norsk Tillitsmann will withhold an amount o f the distribution on an escrow account until any possible liability litigation

<<<

 is closed.
In order to provide sufficient liquidity for any litigation or arbitration or other legal process resulting from the resolution of the Bondholders' meeting, Norsk Tillitsmann may require funding from the Bondholders voting in favour

<<<

 of the resolution as a condition to further proceedings, notwithstanding any limitation set out in the resolution. Such funding will be reimbursed to the funding Bondholders on a super priority basis ahead of distribution of principal, interest

<<<

, premium or otherwise made to the Bondholders with respect to the Bonds, and pro rata with other super priority funds followed by the resolution of the Bondholders' meeting. Additionally, in order to protect Norsk Tillitsmann against any shortfall

<<<

 of security relating to any liability obligation, Norsk Tillitsmann may require an indemnity from the Bondholders voting in favour of the resolution as a condition to further proceedings, notwithstanding any limitation set out in the resolution

<<<

.
Norsk Tillitsmann views the instructions from the Bondholders, if resolved, to be based on a view that there would be an anticipatory Event of Default if the Issuer does not pay the Redemption Amount and Norsk Tillitsmann would consequently

<<<

 be entitled to request satisfactory security for any possible liability and anticipated expenses, see Clause 15.3.
