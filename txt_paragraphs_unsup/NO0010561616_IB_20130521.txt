Memo from AOS
MARINE SUBSEA CYPRUS HOLDING SERIES II BOND AND A POTENTIAL

<<<

 CLAIM AGAINST YANTAI
A. Potential Claim and Proposed Agreement
Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd (MSCH) is the issuer of the Series II 2009/2019 Senior Secured Bond. The bond had a first priority share pledge in MSCH's shares in Marine Subsea

<<<

 &Consafe Ltd (MSC) and a first priority pledge on any shareholder loan provided by MSCH to MSC. MSCH's former owner, Marine Subsea AS (MSAS), has guaranteed for the bond's payment.
MSCH invested approximately USDm 40 in MSC, enabling MSC to

<<<

 order a semi-submersible crane vessel (SSCV). Neither this vessel, nor a second upgraded unit, were ever delivered to MSC. MSCH has always maintained that it has a right to claim against the shipyard, Yantai, and the other parties involved

<<<

, these being CIMC/Yantai and the Swedish offshore entrepreneur Christer Eriksson.
Yantai has however denied that MSCH has a right to claim, therefore as a result of MSCH's limited liquidity, MSCH has not been in a position to pursue the claim

<<<

. However in April 2013 it was reported that Yantai had sold both the original SSCV and the upgraded unit for USDm 165 and USDm 357 respectively. It was reported that both units may have been awarded 5y + 5y contracts with Petrobras. In light

<<<

 of the above, the current owner of MSCH, African Offshore Holding Ltd (AOS), believes that a claim for compensation will have a significant effect on Yantai and that the compensation could be as much as USDm 78.
This level of compensation assumes

<<<

 however that the Angolan state oil company, Sonangol, has no claim against MSC. It should however be assumed that Sonangol will claim against MSC, particularly if MSCH is to be successful with its claim against Yantai. On the other hand, AOS

<<<

 has a strong relationship with Sonangol and it could be advantageous for the case if a "supportive" Sonangol is included in the process.
MSCH is insolvent and is currently undergoing liquidation proceedings in Cyprus. MSCH's only assets of

<<<

 any value are the shares in MSC and any potential claim on MSC or MSC's shareholders and/or suppliers. MSAS is in bankruptcy and the MSAS bankruptcy estate had limited cash (NOKm 5.5) as of 31.12.12 and there were NOKm 622 in registered claims

<<<

 including the Series II Bond's claim. The MSAS bankruptcy estate has, for reasons not announced, indicated that it has no interest in looking after Series II bondholders' position by pursuing a claim against Yantai. This may entail that the

<<<

 Series II bondholders may have to pursue Yantai directly.
The owners and management of AOS know the case in depth and have a strong relationship with Sonangol. AOS would therefore like to propose that the Series II bondholders enter into an

<<<

 agreement with the AOs with the following key elements:
i. AOS will at its sole expense claim against and legally pursue all involved parties. ii. Any return on the claim will be shared 50/50 between AOS and Series II Bondholders.

B

The Original Transaction 2007/2008

In 2007 Consafe MSV AB (Consafe), a company owned 50/50 by Yantai Raffles and the Swedish offshore entrepreneur Christer Eriksson, approached Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd (MSCH) with the

<<<

 idea of building an anchor moored, semi-submersible crane and accommodation vessel (SSCV). MSCH and Consafe agreed to form a JV, to be named Marine Subsea &Consafe Ltd (MSC), with the intention of entering into the SSCV-market.
In November

<<<

 2007, Consafe entered into a Shipbuilding Contract with Yantai Raffles for an SSCV, whereby Safe Challenger is ordered. The turn-key contract price was USDm 210 (including financing, site supervision, contingency, commissioning) and according

<<<

 to the contract USDm 67.4 was to be paid in first instalment, with the balance, USDm 142.6, to be paid on delivery in 2009.

In November 2007, MSC entered into a Purchase Agreement with Consafe for Safe Challenger. The terms of the purchase

<<<

 agreement mirrored the terms of the Shipbuilding Contract between Consafe and Yantai.

Also in 2007, MSCH marketed the African Challenger to Sonangol. Sonangol committed to a five year time-charter contract at an average dayrate of USD 150

<<<

,000 per day, with annual escalation.

In June 2008 MSCH, Consafe and Sonangol entered into a shareholders' agreement regarding their rights and obligations as shareholders in MSC:

i.

MSCH paid Consafe a fee of USDm 11.4 for the project and

<<<

 the right to participate in the JV

("entrance premium and contingencies"). This payment was accounted for in MSC's account

as USDm 11.4 in equity paid by MSCH. Consafe was granted the same equity position as

compensation for their contribution

<<<

 to the project.

ii.

As compensation for the time-charter contract, Sonangol received 20% of the equity in the

JV with a book value of USDm 5,7.

iii. The first instalment of Consafe's Shipbuilding Contract was financed by MSCH paying USDm

<<<



33.7 to Consafe and Consafe reportedly paying USDm 67.4 to Yantai. These payments were

accounted for in MSC's accounts as shareholder loans held 50/50 by MSCH and Consafe. It

was further agreed that MSC's operating costs prior to delivery

<<<

 would be funded by MSCH

and Consafe as shareholder loans.

MSC was therefore originally financed as follows:

i.

USDm 28.5 in equity, that was held 40% by MSCH (paid in cash), 40% by Consafe (for

providing the newbuild contract) and 20%

<<<

 by Sonangol (for providing the time-charter

contract)

ii.

USDm 67.4 in shareholder loans, held 50/50 by MSCH and Consafe.

MSCH financed these investments by drawing NOKm 390 under a bond loan that was later converted into the Series II

<<<

 Bond. The Series II Bond has a first priority pledge on MSCH's equity in MSC and MSCH's loan to MSC.

C

Potential Cancellation and Agreement Revision in 2009

In 2009 it became apparent that Yantai was unable to deliver

<<<

 the African Challenger according to the Shipbuilding Contract. Furthermore, Yantai and Christer Eriksson informed MSCH that CIMC, the owners of Yantai, wished to acquire Christer Eriksson's shares in MSC.

MSCH was at the time in the need of

<<<

 refinancing and the non-delivery of African Challenger made the refinancing difficult. MSCH considered therefore cancelling the Purchase Agreement and Shipbuilding Contract and demanding compensation from Consafe and Yantai. Both Consafe and

<<<

 Yantai argued however for revising the contract terms and SSCV-specification and all parties reached an agreement on a number of steps that was assumed would create value:

i. The Shipbuilding Contract was to be revised and the new unit to

<<<

 be renamed African Challenger. Revisions were to include later delivery date (2012), specification upgrade (including DP3) and revised price to compensate for DP3 addition.
ii. Yantai/CIMC was to take delivery of African Challenger for its

<<<

 own account and to lease the unit to MSC on a 10-year bareboat lease with purchase options. The terms of the lease were to reflect the revised cost of African Challenger and the payments made to date.
iii. Sonangol was to recommit to a new

<<<

 5-year time-charter for African Challenger. iv. CIMC, the owners of Yantai, were to acquire Christer Eriksson's shares in MSC, making Sonangol,
MSCH and CIMC/Yantai the only final beneficial owners in the project. v. Yantai was to assist MSCH

<<<

 with its refinancing by contributing with a short term loan.

The revised agreements, in their entirety, were structured to secure the full financing of African Challenger and to simplify the organisational model. The final agreements were

<<<

 expected to be in place in early 2010.

Due to MSCH's refinancing needs, MSCH asked Sonangol to confirm its commitment immediately and a new time-charter contract was entered into in 2009.

Similarly, MSCH had to enter into a short term financing

<<<

 agreement with Yantai immediately, wherby MSCH's outstanding shareholder loan (approx. USDm 40 at the time) was sold to Yantai for USDm 12.5. MSCH had a right to repurchase the loan by June 2010 but with the understanding that this could be

<<<

 extended for 12 months to mid 2011.

Regarding ClMCs wish to acquire Christer Eriksson's shares in MSC, MSCH gave its approval on the basis that all the above agreements would be finalised.

Regarding the revised newbuilding contract and post

<<<

-delivery lease financing, MSCH and Yantai negotiated throughout 2010 in order to finalise the agreements.

Memo from AOS

D

Unsigned MoU, January 2011

In January 2011 MSCH and Yantai agreed on the wording of a MoU for a revised contract

<<<

 for African Challenger. The main elements were:

i. All MSCH payments to date, including interest up to the date of delivery, was to be credited as 50% of the equity in the new project (approx. USDm 42)
ii. African Challenger's specification

<<<

 was to be enhanced (DP3, 600 beds, no cranes) and contract price was to be revised to USDm 290 (including contingency and pre-delivery financing)
iii. Post-delivery financing would be provided as an 11-year lease, with a lease rate of USD 

<<<

83 334 per day (equivalent to an all-in financing cost of approximately 10%).

Assuming that the unit could generate USD 175 000-225 000 per day in the market (Sonangol had guaranteed USD 155 000) and opex of USD 50 000, the project was at the

<<<

 time expected to be able to generate a net profit after lease payments of USDm 15-33 p.a. on a 100% basis.

Unfortunately, Yantai never signed the MoU and never gave any reason for not doing so. Throughout most of 2011, Yantai maintained that

<<<

 the unit would be delivered in early 2012 and they supported MSCH in their endeavours to get an international oil company to take the unit in order to offload Sonangol's time-charter guarantee obligation. This included arranging a site visit

<<<

 for Total. The technical findings at the Total visit were however very disappointing and it became apparent for both MSCH and Sonangol, that Yantai would need more time in order to finalize the unit.

MSCH's negotiations with Yantai broke down

<<<

 during the second half of 2011

E

Overview MSC's Assets, Debt and Equity

Assets MSC's original asset was the contract for delivery in 2009 of the SSCV-newbuild Safe Challenger. According to Consafe, USDm 67.4 was paid to Yantai and USDm 

<<<

142.6 was outstanding for payment on delivery.

Due to the non-delivery of Safe Challenger, it was agreed to revise the specification and delivery time and Yantai commenced work on the revised unit, African Challenger. The new unit was to have

<<<

 DP3 specification. AOS signed an LOI with Yantai agreeing new price and 11-year post delivery financing from CIMC. The formal contract was never signed by Yantai. MSCH has been given no reason why.

Debt to shareholders MSC's original debt

<<<

 consisted of USDm 67 in shareholder loans. This debt was originally held 50/50 by MSCH and Consafe. However in 2009 CIMC acquired MSCH's debt for USDml2.5 and after having acquired all the shares in Consafe, CIMC/Yantai have argued that they

<<<

 hold all of MSC's debt.

MSCH maintains that the shareholder loan sold to Yantai can be repurchased for USDm 12.5.

4

Memo from AOS
According to the last available accounts (2010) including accrued interest, MSC has a total of USDm 86 in

<<<

 outstanding debt split as follows: Debt to MSCH USDm44 of which USDm 42 was acquired by CIMC and MSCH had a repurchase right at a cost of USDm 12.5 Debt to Yantai USDm 42 Total debt USDm 86 Equity MSC's equity was held as follows::40% AOS,

<<<

 40% CIMC/Yantai, 20% Sonangol

F

Summary of MSCH's, Yantai/ClMC's and Sonangol's Positions

MSCH's Position MSCH has maintained up to the present that African Challenger belongs to MSC and that MSC has the right to take delivery on payment

<<<

 of the final instalment due on delivery. MSCH has previously claimed that the amount due for African Challenger would be approx. USDm 153 (outstanding contract payment of USDm 143 + an USDm 11 adjustment for the DP3 upgrade).

If it is Safe

<<<

 Challenger that has to be taken delivery of, MSCH will claim that the final payment would have to reflect a compensation for a minimum of 4 years loss of earnings of USDm 15 p.a. due to gross negligence and late delivery. This would lower the

<<<

 outstanding payment obligation by USDm 60.

The final delivery payment is according to the shareholder agreement to be shared 50/50 by MSCH and CIMC. As an alternative, MSCH has stated that MSCH can acquire ClMCs position in MSC for the outstanding

<<<

 debt and take full ownership together with Sonangol.

Regarding the question of the ownership of MSC's debt and the right to repurchase, MSCH claims that when Yantai acquired MSC's debt to MSCH, Yantai was well aware of the fact that they would

<<<

 not be able to deliver the rig in compliance with the Shipbuilding Contract and that MSC would have a claim against Yantai as a result of this. By positioning themselves as a creditor in MSC, Yantai effectively ensured that any compensation

<<<

 awarded to MSC would be returned to them, instead of the investors in MSC.

MSCH maintains therefore that the debt can be repurchased for the initial price paid of USDm 12.5. By excluding the obligation to repay USDm 12.5 in MSC's debt to MSCH

<<<

 and by including it in the debt to Yantai/CIMC, MSC's total debt of USDm 86 can be assumed to be made up of USDm 31.5 owed to MSCH and USDm 54.5 owed to CIMC/Yantai.

ClMCs Position

5

Memo from AOS
CIMC has a conflicting interest as co-owner

<<<

 of MSC and owner of Yantai, the shipbuilder. MSCH has only had an informal dialogue with CIMC or Yantai on this conflict and MSCH has not been informed of their formal positions. CIMC/Yantai has however given the impression that they believe

<<<

 MSCH cancelled the original contract, despite being no documentation, despite the Moll and despite them not returning MSC's payment.
Irrespective of the above, the following issues should be considered:
i. It can be argued that MSC's claim

<<<

 on Yantai/Consafe may be limited to USDm 13.6. Yantai has breached the Shipbuilding Contract due to non-delivery of the African Challenger, but under the agreement, Consafe's claim is limited to USDm 12.5 from Yantai. Under the Purchase Agreement

<<<

, MSC has the right to pursue this claim directly towards Yantai on behalf of Consafe. Consafe has breached the Purchase Agreement due to non-delivery of the African Challenger, but under the agreement, MSC's claim is limited to USD 13,6 million

<<<

 from Consafe.
ii. Yantai will claim that any proceeds forthcoming to MSC are owed to Yantai Yantai will claim that MSC's debt to Yantai is USDm 84m plus interest, and that any successful claim against Yantai would only go to partially repaying

<<<

 the debt to Yantai.
Sonangol's Position
MSC entered into TC-arrangements with Sonangol in 2007 and 2009. The first contract was for the original SSCV, Safe Challenger. The second contract was intended to replace the original TC-agreement and

<<<

 was for the upgraded SSCV, African Challenger.
Due to the non-performance of Yantai, MSC has not been able to provide Sonangol with a unit according to the TC-agreements. MSCH has been in close dialogue with Sonangol, and Sonangol has expressed

<<<

 support for MSCH. The board of MSC was however informed in March 2012 that Sonangol was not happy with MSC's and Yantai's handling of the project, and that Sonangol was considering seeking compensation from MSC/Yantai for damages.

Yantai

's Reported Sale of the Two Units and the Potential Claim

In April 2013 Upstream reported that the Safe Challenger (now named SSCV206) and the African Challenger (now named C.Ajax) had been sold to OOS International B.V. for USDm 165 and USDm

<<<

 357 respectively.

Both units shall have been awarded 5y + 5y contracts with Petrobras, however this has as yet not been confirmed by Petrobras. The size of the transaction in itself provides an insentive to pursue a claim. The fact that Yantai

<<<

 did not inform MSC indicates that there is a conflict.

6

Memo from AOS

The potential value of MSCH's position in MSC is outlined in the table below. The valuation assumes that MSC receives the announced sales prices per unit and is calculated

<<<

 based on both MSCH's and Yantai's view of who holds MSC's debt.

It must be noted that the calculation is based on assumptions that are challenged. However, in all of the scenarios outlined below, MSCH can look for a return, with a low of USDm

<<<

 2 and a high of USDm 78. Furthermore, it can be assumed that the allocation of the consideration to each unit has been done in order to minimize the financial consequence of any claim.

Memo from AOS

Finally, it should be noted that these figures assume that Sonangol

<<<

 has no claim against MSC. Sonangol has however stated that it will consider claiming for damages as the unit has not been delivered according to MSC's contractual obligation.
We have no knowledge of the dayrate that Petrobras is committed to

<<<

. It can however be assumed that Sonangol had profitable work for the unit(s) in West Africa. It should therefore be assumed that Sonangol will claim against MSC, particularly if MSCH is to win in its claim against Yantai.
On the other hand

<<<

, the current owner of MSCH, African Offshore Holding Ltd (AOS), has a strong relationship with Sonangol and it could be advantageous for MSCH's case if a supportive Sonangol is included in the process.

G

Conclusion

The current owner of MSCH

<<<

, African Offshore Holding Ltd (AOS), believes that a claim for compensation will have a significant effect on Yantai and that the compensation could be as much as USDm 78.

Sonangol has a potential claim against MSC, but it could also be advantageous

<<<

 for MSCH's case if a supportive Sonangol is included in the process.

The current owner of MSCH, African Offshore Holding Ltd (AOS) has both in-depth knowledge of the history of the project and a strong relationship with Sonangol.
