BACKGROUND

Standstill agreement

As previously communicated in press releases, the Real People Group is experiencing financial

<<<

 difficulties and the Issuer has entered into a standstill agreement (as amended from time to time (the "Standstill Agreement") with creditors in order to facilitate a restructuring of its capital structure.

On 22 June 2017 a written procedure

<<<

 ended in which the Bondholders decided to become Standstill Creditors under the Standstill Agreement together with the other creditors that are parties to the Standstill Agreement.

No interest or capital repayments will be made to the Standstill

<<<

 Creditors whilst the standstill period is ongoing. Further, the Standstill Creditors have agreed not to take any enforcement action against the Issuer and the Group during the standstill period, which pursuant to Clause 6.2.1 o f the Standstill

<<<

 Agreement expires no later than on 31 August 2017 unless further extended by the Super Majority Standstill Creditors (as defined in the Standstill Agreement).

The restructuring will not be possible to complete before 31 August 2017. A continued

<<<

 standstill period is necessary for a successful restructuring and the Issuer therefore requests that the Bondholders agree to further extend the standstill period to expire no later than on 30 November 2017.

In order to limit the risk that

<<<

 the standstill period is automatically terminated and that the restructuring is jeopardized due to frivolous or vexations actions the Issuer also proposes that the Bondholders consent to an addendum to the Standstill Agreement to the effect

<<<

 that the automatic termination o f the standstill period upon certain enforcement actions is qualified by a requirement that the Majority Standstill Creditors (as defined in the Standstill Agreement) also elects to terminate the standstill

<<<

 period.

2

For an extract o f the current version o f Clauses 6.1 and 6.2 o f the Standstill Agreement which also includes underlined text that shows the suggest addendum relating to the limitation of the automatic termination, please see

<<<

 Schedule 3 (Amendments to Standstill Agreement).

2.

ADDENDUM AND EXTENSION REQUESTS

The Issuer hereby requests (the "Addendum and Extension Requests") that the Bondholders resolve:

i. to consent to an extension o f the last date o f the

<<<

 Standstill Period (as defined in the Standstill Agreement) as set out in Clause 6.2.1 o f the Standstill Agreement, from no later than 31 August 2017 until no later than 30 November 2017 (the "End Date");

ii. to consent to extensions o f any

<<<

 Milestone Dates (as defined in the Standstill Agreement), but no longer than until the End Date;

iii. to approve that an addendum is made to the Standstill Agreement, whereby the underlined text in the mark-up in Schedule 3 (Amendments to

<<<

 Standstill Agreement) is inserted in the Standstill Agreement, to the effect that the automatic termination of the standstill period upon certain enforcement actions (as set out in Clauses 6.2.3 to 6.2.5 o f the Standstill Agreement) is qualified

<<<

 by the requirement that the Majority Standstill Creditors (as defined in the Standstill Agreement) also elects to terminate the standstill period in accordance with the provisions of the Standstill Agreement; and

iv. to authorize the Agent

<<<

 to consent to the above specified extensions, addendums and amendments on behalf of the Bondholders and execute on behalf of the Bondholders any amendment agreement, amendment and restatement agreement, supplemental or addendum agreement, consent

Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure

<<<

 will, in accordance with the Terms and Conditions: i) be published by way o f press release by the Issuer ii) be sent by notice to the Bondholders and iii) be published on the websites of a) the Issuer and b) the Agent.

The minutes from the

<<<

 Written Procedure shall at the request o f a Bondholder be sent to it by the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable. A matter decided under the W ritten Procedure will be binding for all Bondholders, irrespective o f them responding in the Written

<<<

 Procedure.

C. Voting rights and authorisation

Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (14 August 2017) in the debt register:

(i) be registered as a direct registered owner o f a Securities Account

<<<

; or

(ii) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.

D. Voting with respect to SEK Bonds

Bondholders holding SEK Bonds shall use the SEK Bond Voting Form set out in Schedule 1 to vote

<<<

.

If you are registered as a direct registered owner with respect to a SEK Bond, you may vote in your own name without providing further evidence o f ownership.

If you are not registered as a direct registered owner with respect to a SEK Bond

<<<

, but your SEK Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the SEK Bonds.

1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds

<<<

 the SEK Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.

2. You can obtain a Power o f Attorney (Appendix to SEK Bonds Voting Form) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based

<<<

 on the authorization. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorization directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as bondholder o f the Securities Account, or from each intermediary

<<<

 in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a Bondholder o f the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.

W hether one or both o f these options are available

<<<

 to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the SEK Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).

The Agent recommends that you

<<<

 contact the securities firm that holds the SEK Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your SEK Bonds are registered or need authorization or other assistance to participate

<<<

. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights.

E.

Voting with respect to NOK Bonds

Bondholders holding NOK Bonds shall use the NOK Bond Voting Form set out in Schedule 2 to vote.



<<<

Bondholders holding NOK Bonds must provide a complete printout from VPS (Norway) evidencing their holding o f NOK Bonds, or, if their NOK Bonds are held in custody other than in the VPS (Norway), evidence from their custodian confirming

<<<

 least fifty (50) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.

<<<
