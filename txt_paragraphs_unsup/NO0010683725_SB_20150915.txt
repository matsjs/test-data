 Issue 2013/2018"
Oslo, 15 September 2015
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Trustee") for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue ISIN NO 001 068372.5 (with total

<<<

 outstanding amount of NOK 500 million) (the "Bond Issue" or "SBO01") issued by Selvaag Bolig ASA (the "Issuer" or the "Company").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 24 June

<<<

 2013 (as later amended from time to time) and made between the Trustee and the Issuer (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. References to Clauses and paragraphs are references to Clauses and paragraphs in the Bond Agreement

<<<

.
The information in this summons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status of the Issuer is provided by the Issuer. The Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information givenfrom the Issuer

<<<

.
1. BACKGROUND
The Issuer issued SBO01 in June 2013 with the purpose of refinancing existing debt and for general corporate purpose. The Issuer is one of Norway's largest residential real estate developers with prime focus on the largest urban

<<<

 areas in Norway with solid economic growth and substantial housing demand. The Issuer is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange with a market cap of approximately NOK 2.4 billion as of 14 September 2015 and is majority owned by Selvaag Gruppen AS

<<<

 (53.5%).
The Issuer has over the last 24 months delivered solid financial performance. Pareto Securities Credit Research maintains a BB rating on the Issuer, reflecting the Issuer's robust business model combined with the solid project pipeline

<<<

 and its sizable land bank.
The Company is considering amending its dividend policy from one annual dividend payment to interim/semi-annual dividend payments in line with several other companies that are listed on Oslo Bors. The rationale is

<<<

 to increase the liquidity in the Company's share which is viewed as important for all existing and future shareholders.
However, the existing Bond Agreement currently limits the Company to make dividend payments, repurchase of shares or make

<<<

 any loan or other equity or capital distributions or payments to its shareholders, exceeding 50% of Issuer's consolidated net profit after taxes based on the Financial Statements for the previous financial year.
This means in practical terms

<<<

 that the Company can only make dividend payments based on full audited consolidated annual financial statement which shall be available not later than 120 days after the end of each financial year.

As mentioned above, the Company would like to be in a position to offer its shareholders semi-annual dividend payments during the course of each financial year. Notwithstanding this, the overall limit o f 

<<<

50% of the Issuer's consolidated net profit after taxes shall, save for with respect to the dividend payment described in section 2.2 below, remain unchanged.
The Company had a strong financial performance for the financial year 2014. On that

<<<

 basis the Company announced 27 February 2015 a dividend payment of NOK 1.20 per share equal to NOK 112.5 million or 44.4% of net result after tax for 2014. The value creation during the first 6 months of 2015 has continued to be strong by way

<<<

 of net profit after tax equivalent to NOK 1.52 per share. Consequently, the Company proposes to pay a second dividend of NOK 0.70 per share before year end 2015 equal to NOK 65.6 million based on the financial performance of 1H 2015.
However

<<<

, in order to make a dividend payment based on the 1H 2015 result, the Company is required according to Norwegian Companies Act (no. allmennaksjeloven) to conduct a full audit of the numbers. As an alternative, the Company would like to make

<<<

 the second dividend payment on the basis of the 2014 Financial Statements. The remaining dividend capacity based on the 2014 Financial Statements substantially exceeds the aggregate of the dividend already paid in 2015 and the proposed second

<<<

 dividend.
Although the proposed second dividend payment will be made as a result of the cash position of the Company as of 30 June 2015, the dividend payment as proposed will technically be based on the 2014 Financial Statements and thus result

<<<

 in a total dividend payment in 2015 which exceeds the 50% limit of the Bond Agreement.
When the Board of Directors o f the Company decides the size of any future interim dividend, the visibility of the full year earnings will be veiy good.

<<<

 As for the 2015 result, the Company has year-to-date presold 89% of the full year 2015 production. Equally, 84% of the 1H 2016 production is presold. The Board of Directors will, going forward and save for with respect to the proposed second

<<<

 dividend payment described in section 2.2 below, never approve an aggregate annual dividend payment exceeding 50% of net profit after tax, in line with the existing covenants in the Bond Agreement.
The Company is of the opinion that the credit

<<<

 position of the Bondholders will not be impaired by this proposed amendment to the dividend payments as the Company's cash balance as of 30 June 2015 was NOK 470 million and as such the proposed second dividend o f NOK 65.6 million represent

<<<

 less than 14% of the Company's cash balance.
2. PROPOSAL

 following proposed amendments (the "Proposal"):

Notwithstanding the above, the Issuer

<<<

 may make interim Distributions during any calendar year based on Interim Accounts for that financial year, however provided that the aggregate Distribution (interim and otherwise and always in compliance with the Norwegian Companies Act {no

<<<

. allmennaksjeloven)) for any financial year does not exceed 50% of the Issuer's consolidated net profit after taxes as referred to above."
2.2 Consent to dividend payment

<<<

 that the Bondholders consent to the contemplated additional dividend payment of NOK 0.70 per share, which is expected to be paid no earlier than 15 October 2015.
