BACKGROUND

The Issuer

<<<

 requests the Noteholders to permit the Debt Reorganisation and to waive certain related provisions of the Note Terms and Conditions, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agreements, please see further below.

The purpose of the Debt

<<<

 Reorganisation is to strengthen the balance sheet of PolygonVatro and to better reflect the revenue profile of the Group on an entity-by-entity basis. In order to strengthen PolygonVatro, which is an important matter to the whole Group, it

<<<

 is necessary to waive or otherwise transfer several intragroup loans over which security have been granted.

Execution Version 13 June 2016,

The Issuer believes that it is very beneficial to the Group to carry out the

<<<

 Debt Reorganisation and that the repayment capacity of the Group will be further enhanced thereby. In addition, the Debt Reorganisation will also lead to a higher VAT efficiency in the Group; hence, the Issuer does not believe that the execution

<<<

 of the Debt Reorganisation would be detrimental to the Noteholders.

The Group will monitor and as necessary amend the currently applied group recharges and the royalty structure levied by PIAB to safe guard their debt servicing capability

<<<

.

2.1

German Debt Position

The Polygon group has, ever since it was acquired by Triton Fund III and the acquisition of its current German operation PolygonVatro, had a significant amount of debt allocated to Polygonvatro. The reason therefore

<<<

 was, among other things, the earnings at the time.

The debt currently outstanding in PolygonVatro amounts to EUR 59,704,197.61 (the "Intragroup Loan") and a negative cash pool amount outstanding of approximately EUR 40,000,000. These amounts

<<<

 are intragroup debt owed to PIAB.
These debt items incur a weak equity position of PolygonVatro and the interests due cannot be utilised for tax purposes, whilst generating a significant amount of taxable interest income in PIAB.

2.2

Debt

<<<

 Reorganisation

In order to manage the above outlined situation, the Group would like to execute the Debt Reorganisation which includes the following steps:

(a)

PIAB contributes:

(i)

22

<<<

,628,167.20 which has been pledged to the Security Agent on

behalf of the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties, and

(ii)

part of its claim on PolygonVatro in the amount of EUR

27.371.832.80 to Polygon Sweden (the total claim held by

<<<



PIAB on PolygonVatro amounts to EUR 59,704,197.61 which

has been pledged to the Security Agent on behalf of the

Noteholders and the other Secured Parties),

to Polygon Sweden (in total EUR 50,000,000) by way of unconditional shareholder

<<<

's contribution;

(b)

Polygon Sweden contributes:

(i)

the claim on PolygonVatro in the amount of EUR

27.371.832.80 received from PIAB in step (a) above, together

with

(ii)

its own claim on PolygonVatro in the amount of EUR

22,628,16

<<<

7.20,

to PolygonVatro (in total EUR 50,000,000) by way of a shareholder's contribution;

(c)

the investor loan agreement evidencing the Investor Loan, which was

amended and restated on 16 April 2014, shall be amended through an

amendment agreement to adjust the interest for future interest periods to 10 per cent. per annum and shall be capitalised annually with the first capitalisation to occur on 31 December 2016;

(d

<<<

)

the Issuer has granted an intragroup loan to PIAB in the amount of EUR

104,200,000 of which EUR 80,000,000 has been pledged to the Security

Agent on behalf of the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties, which

is partially repaid by

<<<

 PIAB by way of transfer of the following intragroup

loans in the total amount of EUR 49,862,585.85 to the Issuer;

(i)

an intragroup loan granted to PolygonVatro in the amount of

EUR 32,332,364.81;

(ii)

an intragroup loan granted to Polygon

<<<

 Holding AS in the

amount of EUR 10,639,101.12 (a NOK denominated loan);

(iii) an intragroup loan granted to Polygon AS in the amount of EUR 439,973.25 (a NOK denominated loan);

(iv) an intragroup loan granted to Polygon Nederlands Holding

<<<

 B.V. in the amount of EUR 5,502,200.00; and

(v)

an intragroup loan granted to Polygon Canada Inc in the amount

of EUR 948,946.67 (a CAD denominated loan); and

(e)

the Issuer extinguishes the residual of the debt owed by PIAB to the

Issuer

<<<

 by way of contributing its claim on PIAB in the amount of EUR

54,330,789.15 to PIAB by way of an unconditional shareholder's

contribution.

2.3

Security

Following the execution of the Debt Reorganisation the Issuer will grant corresponding

<<<

 security over the intragroup loan granted to PolygonVatro in the amount of EUR 32,332,364.81 in favour of the Security Agent, on behalf of the Noteholders and the other Secured Parties.

It can also be noted that the shares in each of the Issuer
