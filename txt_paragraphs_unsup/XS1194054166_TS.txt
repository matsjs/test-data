RISK FACTORS
Riskfactors which the Bank believes may be materialfor the purpose o f assessing certain structural, market and other risks associated with the Notes are incorporated herein by reference

<<<

 from pages 13 to 17 o f the Programme Offering Circular and set out below.
The Bank believes that these riskfactors may affect its ability tofulfil its obligations under the Notes and that these risk factors represent the principal risks inherent

<<<

 in investing in the Notes. However, the Bank may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes, or a Trigger Event, Write Down or cancellation o f interest may occur, for other reasons which may not

<<<

 be considered significant risks by the Bank based on information currently available to it or which it may not currently anticipate. Accordingly, such risk factors do not purport to be an exhaustive list o f all potential risks associated with

<<<

 an investment in the Notes. All such risk factors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Bank is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring. Prospective investors should also read

<<<

 the detailed information incorporated herein by reference or set out elsewhere in this Offering Circular and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
Words and expressions defined elsewhere in this Offering Circular shall

<<<

 have the same meanings in this section.
Risks Related to the Structure of the Notes
The Notes may be subject to a Write Down and upon the occurrence of such an event Noteholders may lose substantially all of their investment in the Notes.
Upon

<<<

 the occurrence of a Trigger Event, a Write Down will occur and the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Note may be written down to as low as U.S.$0.01. As a result, Noteholders may lose substantially all of their investment in the Notes. No

<<<

 Noteholder will have any rights against the Bank with respect to the repayment of any principal amount to the extent so written down or the payment of interest on any principal amount that has been so written down or any other amount on or

<<<

 in respect of any principal amount that has been so written down. Moreover, the Bank's obligation to pay any interest on any principal amount that is to be written down on the relevant Write Down Effective Date, in respect of an Interest Period

<<<

 ending on any Interest Payment Date falling between the date of a Trigger Event and the Write Down Effective Date, shall automatically be deemed to have been cancelled upon the occurrence of such Trigger Event and such interest shall, accordingly

<<<

, not be due and payable. The Write Down shall not constitute an Event of Default or a breach of the Bank's obligations or duties or a failure to perform by the Bank in any manner whatsoever and shall not, of itself, entitle Noteholders to any

<<<

 petition for the insolvency or dissolution of the Bank or otherwise.
A Trigger Event will occur if the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Bank or the Group as at any Measurement Date is less than at the Trigger Level. The Trigger Level

<<<

 is 5.125 per cent. in the case of the Bank and 8.0 per cent. in the case of the Group. Proximity of the Bank's or the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio to the applicable Trigger Level will likely cause volatility in and have an adverse

<<<

 effect on the market price of the Notes. This may also be true prior to the occurrence of a Trigger Event, in anticipation of such an event occurring.
Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Write Down, Noteholders will not (i) receive any shares

<<<

 or other participation rights in the Bank or be entitled to any other participation in the upside potential of any equity or debt securities issued by the Bank or any other member of the Group, or (ii) be entitled to any write-up or any other

<<<

 compensation in the event of a potential recovery of the Bank or any other member of the Group or any subsequent change in the financial condition thereof. A Write Down may occur at any time and on more than one occasion, and may occur even

<<<

 if existing preference shares, participation certificates and ordinary shares of the Bank remain outstanding. Any redemption of the Notes at the option of the Bank (as described in " - The Notes are subject to
6

optional redemption by the

<<<

 Bank") following any Write Down will be at the then Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes, which may be lower than their Original Principal Amount. Although the Bank could, in its sole and absolute discretion, reinstate all or a part of

<<<

 any Write Down Amount under certain conditions described in the Conditions, there can be no assurance that such conditions would ever be satisfied or, even if satisfied, that the Bank would exercise its discretion to implement such a Reinstatement

<<<

.
See "Terms and Conditions of the Notes--Loss Absorption and Reinstatement".
The Notes are a novelform of security and may not be a suitable investmentfor all investors.
The Notes are a novel form of security. As a result, an investment in

<<<

 the Notes will involve certain increased risks. Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of such investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:
(i) have sufficient knowledge

<<<

 and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained in this Offering Circular;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate

<<<

, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an

<<<

 investment in the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes, such as the provisions governing a Write Down and

<<<

 cancellation of interest, understand under what circumstances a Trigger Event will or may be deemed to occur, and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant financial markets and their potential impact on the likelihood of a Trigger Event

<<<

, a Capital Event or a Tax Event occurring; and
(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment, the Write Down of

<<<

 the Notes and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event there may be a Write Down of the Notes even if other regulatory capital instruments of the Bank are not written down or converted into shares.
The

<<<

 terms and conditions of other regulatory capital instruments already in issue or to be issued after the date hereof by the Bank may vary and accordingly such instruments may not be written down at the same time, or to the same extent, as the

<<<

 Notes, or at all. Alternatively, such other regulatory capital instruments may provide that they shall convert into equity, or be entitled to a write up or other compensation in the event of a potential recovery of the Bank or any other member

<<<

 of the Group or a subsequent change in the financial condition thereof. Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, to the extent the prior (or pro rata) write down or conversion of any other regulatory capital instruments issued by the Bank is

<<<

 not applicable under their respective terms, or if applicable, does not occur for any reason, this shall not in any way affect the Write Down of the Notes.
The Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of each of the Bank and the Group is unpredictable

<<<

 and will fluctuate. Any decline in such ratios may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes and could give rise to a Trigger Event.
The market price of the Notes is expected to be affected by fluctuations in the Common Equity

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Bank and the Group. Thus, any indication that the Bank's Common Equity Tier 1
7

Capital Ratio is declining towards 5.125 per cent., or that the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio is declining towards 8

<<<

.0 per cent., may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. The level of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of each of the Bank and the Group may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes.
The Common Equity Tier

<<<

 1 Capital Ratio of each of the Bank and the Group may be calculated as at any date. Consequently, a Trigger Event could occur at any time.
The Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Bank and the Group, and thus the likelihood of the occurrence

<<<

 o f a Trigger Event, is inherently unpredictable and will be affected by a number o f factors, any of which may be outside the Bank's control, as well as by its business decisions and, when making such decisions, the Bank's interests may not

<<<

 be aligned with those of the Noteholders. The calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Bank and the Group could be affected by one or more factors, including, among other things, changes in the mix of the Group's business

<<<

, major events affecting its earnings, dividend payments by the Bank, regulatory changes (including changes to definitions and calculations o f regulatory capital ratios and their components) and the Group's ability to manage risk-weighted assets

<<<

 in both its ongoing businesses and those which it may seek to exit. Such ratio will also depend on the Group's decisions relating to its businesses and operations, as well as the management o f its capital position, and may be affected by changes

<<<

 in applicable accounting rules or by regulatory adjustments which modify the regulatory capital impact o f changes in accounting rules. The Bank will have no obligation to consider the interests of Noteholders in connection with its strategic

<<<

 decisions, including in respect of its capital management. Noteholders will not have any claim against the Bank or any other member of the Group relating to decisions that affect the business and operations o f the Group, including its capital

<<<

 position, regardless of whether they result in the occurrence of the Trigger Event. Such decisions could cause Noteholders to lose all or part of the value of their investment in the Notes.
The Bank and the Group are subject to the EU Bank

<<<

 Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Notes may be subject to loss absorption pursuant to the exercise ofpowers thereunder.
The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (the "Resolution Directive" or "BRRD") contains resolution tools and

<<<

 powers which may be used alone or in combination if the relevant resolution authority considers that:
· a bank (or its group) is failing or likely to fail;
· there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures would

<<<

 prevent the failure o f such institution within a reasonable timeframe; and
· a resolution action is in the public interest.
Those tools and powers allow:
· a sale of business, which enables the resolution authority to direct the sale of the

<<<

 firm or the whole or part of its business on commercial terms;
· the creation of a bridge institution, which enables the resolution authority to transfer all or part of the business of the firm to a "bridge institution" (an entity created for

<<<

 this purpose that is wholly or partially in public control); and
· asset separation, which enables the resolution authority to transfer impaired or problem assets to one or more publicly owned asset management vehicles in order to allow them

<<<

 to be managed with a view to maximising their value through eventual sale or orderly wind-down and can only be used together with another resolution tool.
The BRRD resolution tools and powers also include a general bail-in tool, which gives

<<<

 the resolution authority the power to write down certain claims of unsecured creditors of a failing bank or group and
8

to convert certain unsecured debt claims, including the Notes, to equity, which could, in turn, also be subject to any

<<<

 future application of the general bail-in tool.
The BRRD also provides for a Member State of the EU as a last resort, after having assessed and exploited the above resolution tools to the maximum extent possible whilst maintaining financial

<<<

 stability, to be able to provide extraordinary public financial support through additional financial stabilisation tools. These consist of the public equity support and temporary public ownership tools. Any such extraordinary financial support

<<<

 must be provided in accordance with the EU state aid framework.
A bank (or its group) will be considered as failing or likely to fail when it is, or is likely in the near future to be, in breach of its requirements for continuing authorisation

<<<

, its assets are, or are likely in the near future to be, less than its liabilities, it is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due or (except in limited circumstances) it requires extraordinary public

<<<

 financial support.
In addition to the general bail-in tool, the BRRD provides for resolution authorities to have the further power permanently to write down or convert into equity capital instruments such as the Notes at the point of non-viability

<<<

 and before any other resolution action is taken ("non-viability loss absorption"). Any shares issued to holders of the Notes upon any such conversion into equity could, in turn, also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool

<<<

.
For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point of non viability under the BRRD is the point at which the relevant authority determines that the bank (or its group) meets the conditions for resolution

<<<

 (but no resolution action has yet been taken) or that the bank (or its group) will no longer be viable unless relevant capital instruments (such as the Notes) are written-down or converted into equity or extraordinary public support is to be

<<<

 provided and without such support the appropriate authority determines that the bank (or its group) would no longer be viable.
The BRRD provides that it will be applied by Member States of the EU from 1 January 2015, except for the general

<<<

 bail-in tool which is to be applied from 1 January 2016. No Swedish legislation has yet been adopted to implement the BRRD. A legislative proposal for implementation was announced in June 2014, which was then subject to a consultation process

<<<

 among public authorities and market participants during the autumn of 2014. On the basis of the input received during that consultation process, the Swedish Ministry of Finance will announce a final legislative proposal to be voted on in the

<<<

 Swedish Parliament. The timing of this remains uncertain.
The powers set out in the BRRD will impact how banks are managed as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors. Once the BRRD is implemented, holders of the Notes may

<<<

 be subject to write down or conversion into equity on any application of the general bail-in tool and non viability loss absorption, which may result in such holders losing some or all of their investment. The exercise of any power under the

<<<

 BRRD or any suggestion of such exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the rights of Noteholders, the price or value of their investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Bank to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.

<<<


The Conditions of the Notes are subject to the laws of Sweden and their interpretation by the Relevant Regulator. The implementation of many aspects of CRD IV and the BRRD in Sweden, and their interpretation by the Relevant Regulator, are uncertain

<<<

 and may have a material effect on the terms of the Notes.
The rights and remedies of Noteholders may be affected by changes in the laws of Sweden after the date of this Offering Circular or the official interpretation of aspects of CRD IV and

<<<

/or BRRD by the Relevant Regulator or the European Central Bank after the date hereof.
9

Future changes could include the implementation of statutory resolution, bail-in and/or loss absorption measures, or other regulatory, statutory or tax

<<<

 regimes, any or all of which could materially adversely effect the rights of holders of the Notes and the market price of the Notes.
In particular, CRD IV is a relatively recently set of rules and regulations that imposes a series of new requirements

<<<

, some of which will be phased in over a number of years. Implementation of important parts of CRD IV in Sweden was delayed until 2 August 2014. Although the CRD IV Regulation is directly applicable in each Member State, CRD IV leaves a number

<<<

 of important interpretational issues to be resolved through binding technical standards that have not yet been adopted, and leaves certain other matters to the discretion of the Relevant Regulator.
Any such changes (including those which may

<<<

 result from the publication of the technical standards which interpret the CRD IV Regulation) could impact the calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Bank and/or the Group, which could give rise to the occurrence of the

<<<

 Trigger Event in circumstances where such Trigger Event may not otherwise have occurred. The calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Bank and/or the Group may also be affected by other factors, see " - The Common Equity

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital Ratio of each of the Bank and the Group is unpredictable and will fluctuate. Any decline in such ratios may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes and could give rise to a Trigger Event".
Such changes could also

<<<

 result in the Bank having the option to redeem the Notes, as referred to in " The Notes are subject to optional redemption by the Bank" and " - Redemption upon occurrence of a Tax Event or a Capital Event is within the Bank's discretion", or

<<<

 substitute the Notes or vary their terms, as referred to in "--Upon the occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event the Bank may substitute the Notes or vary the terms of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders and such substitution or

<<<

 variation may materially adversely affect the rights of Noteholders" in circumstances which otherwise it might not have such rights.
Such changes, or any uncertainty relating to future implementation or interpretation, may have a material impact

<<<

 on the market price of the Notes and/or the ability to accurately value the Notes.
There is no scheduled redemption or maturity of the Notes.
The Notes are undated securities without any fixed redemption or maturity date. The Bank is under

<<<

 no obligation to redeem the Notes at any time. Any optional redemption by the Bank is subject to the prior approval of the Relevant Regulator. There is no redemption at the option of the Noteholders.
The Notes are subject to optional redemption

<<<

 by the Bank.
The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Bank in whole, but not in part, only (i) on any Optional Redemption Date or (ii) at any time for certain withholding tax reasons as provided in Condition 5(b) or (iii) upon the occurrence

<<<

 of a Tax Event or a Capital Event, in each case only with the prior written consent of the Relevant Regulator in accordance with Condition 5.
Under CRD IV, the competent authority (the Relevant Regulator in the case of the Bank) will give its

<<<

 consent to a redemption or repurchase of the Notes, provided that either of the following conditions is met:
(a) on or before such redemption or repurchase of the Notes, the Bank replaces the Notes with capital instruments of an equal or higher

<<<

 quality on terms that are sustainable for its income capacity; or
(b) the Bank has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Relevant Regulator that its Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital (for the purposes of and within the meaning of the Relevant

<<<

 Rules) would, following such redemption or repurchase, exceed the capital ratios required under CRD IV by a margin that the Relevant Regulator may consider appropriate on the basis set out in CRD IV for the determination of the appropriate

<<<

 level of capital of an institution.
10

In addition, CRD IV provides that the Relevant Regulator may only permit the Bank to redeem the Notes earlier than five years after their Issue Date if, in addition to meeting the conditions referred

<<<

 to in (a) or (b) above, the following conditions are also met:
(A) in the case of redemption due to the occurrence of a Capital Event, (i) the Relevant Regulator considers the relevant change to be sufficiently certain and (ii) the Bank demonstrates

<<<

 to the satisfaction of the Relevant Regulator that the Capital Event was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the issuance of the Notes; or
(B) in the case of redemption due to the occurrence of a Tax Event or for withholding tax reasons

<<<

 pursuant to Condition 5(b), the Bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Relevant Regulator that the relevant event is material and was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of issuance of the Notes.
The rules under CRD IV may be modified

<<<

 from time to time after the date of this Offering Circular.
These optional redemption rights are likely to limit the market price at which the Notes trade. During any period when the Bank may elect to redeem the Notes, the market price of the

<<<

 Notes generally will not exceed the price at which they can be redeemed (which, following a Write Down, may be less than the Original Principal Amount). This also may be true prior to any redemption event, in anticipation of such an event occuring

<<<

.
The Bank may be expected to be more likely to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective

<<<

 interest rate that is as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should carefully consider such reinvestment risk.
Redemption upon occurrence of

<<<

 a Tax Event or a Capital Event is within the Bank's discretion.
Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Capital Event but subject to obtaining the prior written consent of the Relevant Regulator (as referred to in "--The Notes are subject to

<<<

 optional redemption by the Bank"), the Bank may, at its option, redeem all (but not some only) of the Notes at the Outstanding Principal Amount (which, following a Write Down, may be less than the Original Principal Amount).
On 12 June, 20

<<<

14, the Swedish Corporate Taxation Committee (Sw. Foretagsskattekommitten) (the "Taxation Committee") presented a final report in which a new model for the corporate tax treatment of the cost of capital in Sweden was proposed with the stated

<<<

 goal of increasing neutrality in the tax treatment of debt and equity and providing for a more unified corporate tax model. The Taxation Committee has further proposed, as one of the ways in which the contemplated corporate tax changes could

<<<

 be financed, that the deductibility of interest expenses related to certain securities including capital instruments (in the current proposal, only Tier 2 items and instruments) issued by banks be abolished.
The recommendations of the Taxation

<<<

 Committee remain subject to the legislative process and it is not possible to predict whether the changes will be implemented in the form proposed, in a modified form, or at all. Even if such change in applicable tax treatment were to be implemented

<<<

 in respect of such proposals and would otherwise constitute a Tax Event, in the absence of any prior decision of the Relevant Regulator on such matters, it is unclear whether such change would be considered reasonably foreseeable for the purposes

<<<

 of the Relevant Rules and therefore whether the Relevant Regulator would consent to any redemption for the purposes of Condition 5(h).
If the Notes are redeemed in any of the circumstances described above, there can be no assurance that holders

<<<

 of Notes will be able to reinvest the amounts received upon redemption at a rate that will provide the same rate of return that they would otherwise have received on their investment in the Notes. Potential investors should carefully consider

<<<

 such reinvestment risk.
11

Upon the occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event the Bank may substitute the Notes or vary the terms o f the Notes without the consent o f Noteholders and such substitution or variation may materially adversely

<<<

 affect the rights of Noteholders.
Subject to Conditions 5(g) and 5(h), upon the occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event, the Bank may, instead of redeeming the Notes, without the consent of Noteholders at any time substitute them for,

<<<

 or vary their terms provided that they become or, as appropriate, remain Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Securities. Any such substitution or variation may materially adversely affect the rights of the Noteholders and the market price of the Notes

<<<

. Furthermore, the tax and stamp duty consequences of holding particular securities following a substitution may adversely impact some types of investors. See Condition 5(g) and the definition of Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Securities in Condition

<<<

 2.
The Bank may decide to cancel interest payments in its sole and absolute discretion. The Notes are not cumulative instruments and cancelled interest will not accrue.
Interest on the Notes will be due and payable only at the sole and absolute

<<<

 discretion o f the Bank and, accordingly, the Bank shall have sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be due and payable on any Interest Payment

<<<

 Date. If the Bank does not make an interest payment on the relevant Interest Payment Date (or if the Bank elects to make a payment o f a portion, but not all, o f such interest payment), such non payment shall evidence the Bank's exercise of

<<<

 its discretion to cancel such interest payment (or the portion o f such interest payment not paid), and accordingly such interest payment (or the portion thereof not paid) shall not be due and payable.
The Bank is entitled to cancel payments

<<<

 of interest in its sole discretion and it is permitted to do so even if it could make such payments without exceeding the limits described above. Notwithstanding the above, payments of interest on the Notes may be cancelled even if (i) holders

<<<

 of the Bank's shares continue to receive dividends and/or (ii) other regulatory capital instruments remain outstanding and holders of those instruments continue to receive interest payments.
Following any cancellation o f interest as described

<<<

 above, the right o f Noteholders to receive accrued interest in respect o f any such Interest Period will terminate and the Bank will have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments o f interest

<<<

 in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned for any purpose nor will the non-payment of such interest constitute an Event o f Default.
Any actual or anticipated

<<<

 cancellation o f interest on the Notes will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation provisions of the Notes, the market price o fthe Notes may be more volatile than

<<<

 the market prices o f other securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Bank's financial condition.
There are restrictions on interest payments

<<<

 on the Notes.
Any payment of interest in respect of the Notes shall be payable only out of the Bank's Distributable Items and will only be paid to the extent permitted by the Relevant Rules, including the applicable criteria for Additional

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital instruments.
It is currently expected that "discretionary payments" (defined broadly under CRD IV as payments relating to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, payments o f variable remuneration and payments on Additional Tier 1 instruments

<<<

 (including payments o f interest on the Notes, which would include, for the avoidance o f doubt, any additional amounts in respect o f interest which may be payable under Condition 4)) will be required to be cancelled, in whole or in part,

<<<

 to the extent that:
(i) Distributable Items are insufficient to make the relevant payment(s) in the then current financial year;
12

(ii) the combined buffer requirement under the Relevant Rules is not met and, if the relevant payment(s) were

<<<

 made, the amount of such payment(s) would exceed the Maximum Distributable Amount; or
(iii) the Relevant Rules prescribe and/or, as the case may be, the Relevant Regulator requires that the relevant payment(s) shall be cancelled.
The extent

<<<

 of any restriction imposed with respect to the discretionary payments will be adjusted according to the extent of the breach of the combined buffer requirement (as further described in "Capital Adequacy") and calculated as a percentage of the

<<<

 profits of the institution since the last distribution of profits or other discretionary payment. Such calculation would result in the determination of the Maximum Distributable Amount in each relevant period, which will limit the ability of

<<<

 the relevant institution to make discretionary payments. The Maximum Distributable Amount is a novel concept and its determination and application is subject to considerable uncertainty.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest payments

<<<

 will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation provision of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities

<<<

 on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Bank's financial condition.
The Bank or the Group may be subject to additional capital requirements in the future

<<<

. Such additional restrictions may restrict the Bank from making interest payments on the Notes in certain circumstances.
Banks will be required under CRD IV to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital of 8 per cent. of risk weighted assets

<<<

 (so-called "own funds" requirements). CRD IV also introduces various capital buffer requirements (together with the own funds requirement, the so-called "Pillar 1" requirements). To cover those risk elements not fully covered by the Pillar

<<<

 1 requirements further capital requirements may be imposed by the Relevant Regulator under the framework of its supervisory review process (referred to as "Pillar 2"). The Bank is currently subject to both buffer requirements and additional

<<<

 Pillar 2 capital requirements. See "Capital Adequacy" for further details. These additional capital requirements may be subject to change at any time and, accordingly, more onerous capital requirements may be imposed on the Bank.
In September

<<<

 2014, the Relevant Regulator clarified that a capital requirement under Pillar 2 is always additional to the minimum own funds requirements. Where a formal Pillar 2 decision has been taken by the Relevant Regulator (as with respect to the Group

<<<

 as described in "Capital Adequacy"), the Pillar 2 capital requirement will also be additional to any buffer requirements, meaning, inter alia, that it will affect the level at which the automatic restrictions on distributions linked to the

<<<

 combined buffer requirement come into effect. The additional Pillar 2 requirements will therefore restrict the Bank from making some payments in certain circumstances, which may include payments of interest on the Notes and result in the cancellation

<<<

 of such payments. See "- There are restrictions on interest payments on the Notes".
Further formal Pillar 2 decisions will only be taken if it is deemed necessary, for example in times of financial stress where a firm does not have a credible

<<<

 plan for restoring its capital. In less severe circumstances the Relevant Regulator may instead take an informal Pillar 2 decision by informing the firm of its capital assessment. In such a case, the firm may be required to take certain rectifying

<<<

 actions within the framework of applicable regulations in order to avoid such further formal Pillar 2 decisions. If such rectifying actions are required to be taken by the Bank it may adversely affect the Bank's capacity to make interest payments

<<<

 and the market price of the Notes.
The EBA published guidelines on 19 December 2014 addressed to national competent authorities throughout the EU on, inter alia, common procedures and methodologies for the Pillar 2 review. The guidelines relate

<<<

 to, among other things, the amount and composition of additional own funds and are
13

to be implemented by 1 January 2016. The current Pillar 2 practice of the Relevant Regulator, as described and communicated in the September 2014 announcement

<<<

 referred to above, is broadly aligned with these guidelines. However, certain aspects of the Swedish approach to Pillar 2 capital requirements may have to be reviewed in order to comply with the recently published EBA guidelines, as well as

<<<

 any future guidelines and technical standards.
The interest rate reset could affect the market value of the Notes.
The Notes will initially bear interest at a Rate of Interest of 5.25 per cent. per annum from, and including, the Issue Date

<<<

 to, but excluding, the First Reset Date. On the First Reset Date, and each Subsequent Reset Date thereafter, the interest rate will be reset to the sum of the relevant Mid-Swap Rate and the relevant Margin (as determined by the Agent on the

<<<

 relevant Interest Determination Date (each such interest rate, a "Reset Rate of Interest")). The Reset Rate of Interest for any relevant Reset Interest Period could be less than the relevant Initial Rate of Interest or the relevant Reset Rate

<<<

 of Interest for prior Reset Interest Periods, which could affect the market value of an investment in the Notes and reduce the return on the Notes.
The Bank's obligations under the Notes are deeply subordinated.
The Bank's obligations under

<<<

 the Notes will be unsecured and subordinated. Subject to applicable law, in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation (Sw. likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) of the Bank, the rights of Noteholders to payments of the then Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amount of the Notes (which shall be reduced by any relevant Write Down in respect of which a Trigger Event has occurred but in respect of which the relevant Write Down Effective Date has not yet occurred) and any other amounts payable

<<<

 in respect of the Notes (including any accrued and uncancelled interest or damages awarded for breach of any obligations under the Conditions), will rank: (i) pari passu without any preference among the Notes; (ii) at least pari passu in right

<<<

 of payment with payments to holders of present or future outstanding Parity Securities; (iii) in priority in right of payment to payments to holders of present or future outstanding Junior Securities; and (iv) junior in right of payment to

<<<

 the payment of any present or future claims of (a) creditors of the Bank entitled to preference under Swedish law, (b) depositors of the Bank, (c) other unsubordinated creditors of the Bank and (d) creditors of the Bank in respect of Subordinated

<<<

 Indebtedness (other than Parity Securities and Junior Securities).
There are very limited events o f default under the Notes.
The Conditions of the Notes provide for very limited events of default allowing acceleration of the Notes only in

<<<

 cases of certain insolvency related events in respect of the Bank. Moreover, no Noteholder may proceed directly against the Bank unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails to do so within a reasonable time and such failure

<<<

 is continuing, in which case, the Noteholder shall have only such rights against the Bank as those which the Trustee is entitled to exercise. Accordingly, Noteholders will have very limited remedies.
There are no limitations on the Bank's incurrence

<<<

 of additional debt or creation of secured debt.
The Bank is not prohibited from issuing, guaranteeing or otherwise incurring further indebtedness ranking pari passu with, or senior to, its existing obligations and any future obligations or

<<<

 from creating any secured indebtedness without also securing its obligations under the Notes.
Risks Related to the Notes Generally
Modification, waivers and substitution provisions are contained in the Conditions and economic and other basic

<<<

 terms may be amended by less than all the Noteholders or by the Bank.
The Conditions contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions stipulate defined majorities

<<<

 to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
14

In addition to the Bank's ability to modify the Notes without the consent

<<<

 of the Noteholders as referred to in "Risks Related to the structure of the Notes--Upon the occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event the Bank may substitute the Notes or vary the terms of the Notes without the consent of Noteholders and

<<<

 such substitution or variation may materially adversely affect the rights of Noteholders", the Conditions also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of Noteholders and without regard to the interests of particular Noteholders, agree

<<<

 to (i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of Notes or (ii) determine without the consent of the Noteholders that any Event of Default or potential Event of Default

<<<

 shall not be treated as such or (iii) the substitution of another company as principal debtor under any Notes in place of the Bank, in the circumstances described in Condition 13 of the Notes.
The EUSavings Directive is applicable.
Under Council

<<<

 Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income ("Directive 2003/48/EC"), Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by

<<<

 a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State.
On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted

<<<

 a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by Directive 2

<<<

003/48/EC, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. Directive 2003/48/EC will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported

<<<

. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established

<<<

 or effectively managed outside of the EU.
For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden

<<<

 the types of payments subject to withholding under such system assuming such withholding system is still operated when the changes are implemented.
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements

<<<

 relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
If a payment were to be made

<<<

 or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment, neither the Bank nor any Paying Agent (as defined in the Conditions) nor any other person

<<<

 would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. The Bank is required to maintain a Paying Agent in a Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant

<<<

 to Directive 2003/48/EC.
Payments under the Notes may be subject to withholding tax pursuant to the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.
The U.S. "Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act" (or " FATCA") imposes a new reporting regime and, potentially

<<<

, a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to (i) certain payments from sources within the United States, (ii) "foreign passthru payments" made to certain non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with this new reporting regime and

<<<

 (iii) payments to certain investors that do not provide identification information with respect to interests issued by a participating non-U.S. financial institution. The Bank is classified as a financial institution for these purposes. If

<<<

 an amount in respect of such withholding tax were to be deducted or withheld from interest, principal or other payments made in respect of the Notes, neither the Bank nor any paying
15

agent nor any other person would, pursuant to the conditions

<<<

 of the Notes, be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the deduction or withholding. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected. Prospective investors should refer to the section "Taxation Foreign

<<<

 Account Tax Compliance Act".
There may be a change of English or Swedish law.
The Conditions are based on English law in effect as at the Issue Date except for the provisions relating to subordination and loss absorption and reinstatement,

<<<

 which are based on Swedish law in effect as at the Issue Date. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English law or administrative practice or Swedish law or administrative practice, as the

<<<

 case may be, after the Issue Date.
The Notes may be traded in amounts in excess of their denominations and definitive Notes in such amounts may be illiquid.
In relation to the Notes, which have denominations consisting of U.S.$200,000 plus

<<<

 integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof, it is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts in excess of U.S.$200,000 that are not integral multiples of U.S.$200,000. In such a case a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts

<<<

, holds an amount which is less than U.S.$200,000 in his account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a definitive Note in respect of such holding (should definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase

<<<

 a principal amount of Notes such that its holding amounts to an authorised denomination.
If definitive Notes are issued, holders should be aware that definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of U.S.$200,0

<<<

00 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Risks Related to the M arket Generally
There is currently no established marketfor the Notes.
The Notes will have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does

<<<

 develop, it may not be liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell the Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. This may be particularly

<<<

 the case for the Notes given that they are subordinated and include write down features. The Notes may have a more limited secondary market and more price volatility than conventional debt securities. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse

<<<

 effect on the market value of the Notes.
The Notes are exposed to exchange rate risks and exchange controls.
The Bank will pay principal and interest on the Notes in U.S. dollars. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions

<<<

 if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than the U.S. dollar. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes

<<<

 due to devaluation of the U.S. dollar or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor

<<<

's Currency relative to the U.S. dollar would decrease, in terms of the Investor's Currency, the yield on the Notes, the value of the principal payable on the Notes and the market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose

<<<

 (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
The credit ratings of the Notes

<<<

 may not reflect all risks.
The credit ratings of the Notes may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, the market, other additional risk factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of

<<<


16

the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. In general, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation

<<<

 from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended), subject to

<<<

 transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending. This general restriction on the use of credit ratings will also apply in the case of credit ratings issued by non-EU credit rating agencies

<<<

, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the case may

<<<

 be, has not been withdrawn or suspended). Certain information with respect to the credit rating agencies and ratings is set out on the front cover of this Offering Circular.

 Notes bear interest on their Outstanding Principal Amount at the applicable Rate of Interest from (and including) the Issue Date. Interest shall be payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date commencing on 1 March 2016, subject

<<<

 in any case as provided below and in the Conditions. There will be a long first Interest Period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the first Interest Payment Date.
Interest on the Notes will be due and payable only at the

<<<

 sole and absolute discretion of the Bank and, accordingly, the Bank shall have sole and absolute discretion at all times to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be due and payable on any Interest Payment Date

<<<

. If the Bank does not make an interest payment on the relevant Interest Payment Date (or if the Bank elects to make a payment of a portion, but not all, of such interest payment), such non payment shall evidence the Bank's exercise of its discretion

<<<

 to cancel such interest payment (or the portion of such interest payment not paid) and, accordingly, such interest payment (or the portion thereof not paid) shall not be due and payable.
If the Bank provides notice of its intention to cancel

<<<

 a portion, but not all, of an interest payment and the Bank subsequently does not make a payment of the remaining portion of such interest payment on the relevant Interest Payment Date, such non-payment shall evidence the Bank's exercise of

 its discretion to cancel such remaining portion of

the interest payment and, accordingly, such remaining portion of the interest payment shall also not be due and payable.

Interest will only be due and payable on an Interest Payment

 Date to the extent the obligation to pay it is not cancelled in accordance with the provisions set out above. Any interest payment obligation so cancelled (in whole or in part) shall not be due and shall not accrue or be payable at any time

<<<

 thereafter nor shall any cancellation thereof constitute an Event of Default and, accordingly, Noteholders shall have no rights thereto or to receive any additional interest or compensation as a result of such cancellation or deemed cancellation

<<<

.

Restriction on Interest Payments:

Payments of interest in respect of the Notes in any financial year of the Bank shall be made only out of Distributable Items of the Bank. The Bank shall not pay interest on the Notes on any Interest Payment

<<<

 Date (and the obligation to make such interest payment shall therefore be deemed to have been cancelled and thus such interest payment shall not be due and payable on such Interest Payment Date) to the extent that the Bank has an amount of

<<<

 Distributable Items on such Interest Payment Date that is insufficient to pay the sum of (A) all interest payments or distributions on all other own funds instruments of the Bank (determined by the Bank for the purposes of the Relevant Rules

<<<

) paid and/or required and/or scheduled to be paid out of or limited to Distributable Items in the then current financial year and (B) all interest scheduled for payment on the Notes in the then current financial year, but excluding from (A

<<<

) and (B) above any such payments or distributions (or portion thereof) which have already been deducted in calculating the Distributable Items of the Bank.

The Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to make a partial interest

<<<

 payment on the Notes on any Interest Payment Date, but only to the extent that such partial interest payment may be made without breaching the restriction set out in the immediately preceding paragraph.

In circumstances where Article 141 of

<<<

 the CRD IV Directive (or, as the case may be, any provision of Swedish law transposing or implementing such Article) applies, no payments will be made on the Notes (whether by way of principal, interest, Reinstatement Amount or otherwise) if

<<<

 and to the extent that such payment would cause the Maximum Distributable Amount (if any), determined in accordance with the Relevant Rules to be exceeded and, accordingly, in the case of interest, the obligation to make the relevant interest

<<<

 payment or any part thereof shall be deemed to be cancelled.

No Interest Cancellation following a Capital Event:

If a Capital Event has occurred then, beginning on the relevant Capital Event Date, the Bank shall cease to have discretion to

<<<

 cancel its obligation to make interest payments and shall pay amounts of interest accruing on the Notes from and including such Capital Event Date in arrear on each subsequent Interest Payment Date.

W rite Down:

If the Bank determines that

<<<

 a Trigger Event has occurred as at any Measurement Date, then the Bank shall Write Down the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note (in whole or in part, as applicable) on the relevant Write Down Effective Date. Any Write Down Amount

20

<<<



Reinstatement:

shall only be reinstated as set out under the Conditions. The relevant Write Down shall occur without delay (and in any event within one month or such shorter period as the Relevant Regulator may require) following the occurrence

<<<

 of such Trigger Event.
The Bank may determine that a Trigger Event has occurred on more than one occasion and, accordingly, the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note may be written down on more than one occasion provided that the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amount of a Note may never be reduced to below U.S.$0.01.
The Write Down shall not constitute an Event of Default or a breach of the Bank's obligations or duties or a failure to perform by the Bank in any manner whatsoever and shall

<<<

 not, of itself, entitle Noteholders to make any petition for the insolvency or dissolution of the Bank or otherwise.
If the Bank records a positive Net Profit or, to the extent permitted by the Relevant Rules, the Group records a positive Net

<<<

 Profit at any time while the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes is less than their Original Principal Amount, the Bank may, at its sole and absolute discretion and subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount (when the amount of the Reinstatement

<<<

 (as defined below) is aggregated together with other distributions of the Bank or the Group, as applicable, of the kind referred to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (or, if different, any provision of the Relevant Rules implementing

<<<

 Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive)) not being exceeded thereby, reinstate all or any part of any Write Down Amount, such that the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note shall be increased by such amount in accordance with the Reinstatement

<<<

 Procedure (a "Reinstatement") up to a maximum of the Original Principal Amount, on a pro rata basis with the other Notes and with any Written Down Loss Absorbing Instruments of the Bank and, in the case of any increase in the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amount of the Notes by reference to the Net Profit of the Group, any Written Down Loss Absorbing Instruments of the Group, that, in each case, have terms permitting a principal write up or reinstatement to occur on a basis similar to that set

<<<

 out in Condition 6(e) in the circumstances existing on the date of the relevant Reinstatement, provided that the sum of:
(i) the aggregate amount of the relevant Reinstatement on all the Notes;
(ii) the aggregate amount of any payments of interest

<<<

 in respect of the Notes that were paid on the basis of an Outstanding Principal Amount lower than the Original Principal Amount at any time after the end of the previous financial year;
(iii) the aggregate amount of the increase in principal

<<<

 amount of each such Written Down Loss Absorbing Instrument at the time o fthe relevant Reinstatement; and
(iv) the aggregate amount o f any interest payments or distributions in respect o f each such Written Down Loss
21

Absorbing Instrument

<<<

 that were calculated or paid on the basis of an outstanding principal amount that is lower than the principal amount it was issued with at any time after the end of the previous financial year,

does not exceed the Maximum Reinstatement Amount

<<<

.

A Reinstatement may occur on more than one occasion (and any exercise by the Bank of its discretion to effect a Reinstatement shall not preclude the Bank from effecting or not effecting any Reinstatement on any other occasion) provided that

<<<

 the Outstanding Principal Amount of a Note may never exceed its Original Principal Amount.

Optional Redemption:

Subject as provided in the Conditions, the Bank may, on any Optional Redemption Date, redeem all (but not some only) of the Notes

<<<

 to have been cancelled.

<<<

, on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Notes, be required to pay additional amounts as provided in the Conditions, the Bank may, at its option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes each at its Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amount, together with interest accrued to (but excluding) the date of redemption if the Bank's obligation to pay interest has not been cancelled or deemed to be cancelled.

Optional Redemption upon a Capital Event or a Tax Event:

Upon the

<<<

 occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event (each as defined in the Conditions), but subject to the Conditions, the Bank may, at its option at any time redeem all (but not some only) of the Notes at their Outstanding Principal Amount, together

<<<

 with interest accrued to (but excluding) the date of redemption if the Bank's obligation to pay interest has not been cancelled or been deemed to have been cancelled.

Substitution and Variation Instead of Redemption:

If at any time a Capital

<<<

 Event or Tax Event occurs, the Bank may, instead of giving notice to redeem as referred to above, and subject to the Conditions, without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Noteholders or Couponholders, at any time either substitute

<<<

 all (but not some only) of the Notes for, or vary the terms of the Notes provided that they become or, as appropriate, remain Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Securities.

Purchase:

Subject as provided in the Conditions, the Bank or any of its

<<<

If a Capital Event has occurred, then from and including the relevant Capital Event Date, a default in the payment

<<<

 herein to Coupons or coupons shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be deemed to include a reference to Talons or talons.
There are no separate final terms in respect of the Notes and these are the Terms and Conditions (the "Conditions

<<<

") of the Notes.

<<<

 to the nominal amount of Notes standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) shall be treated by the Bank, the Trustee and any Paying Agent as the holder of such nominal

<<<

 amount of Notes for all purposes other than with respect to the payment of principal or interest on the Notes, for which purpose the bearer of the relevant global Note shall be treated by the Bank, the Trustee and any Paying Agent as the holder

<<<

 of such Notes in accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant global Note and the Trust Deed (and the expressions "Noteholder", "holder of Notes", "holder" and related expressions shall be construed accordingly). Notes which are

 of any relevant Coupon against the Bank other than as provided in paragraphs (i) or (ii) above or proving or claiming in the bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) or liquidation (Sw. likvidation) of the Bank in the Kingdom of Sweden or elsewhere, whether

<<<

 for the recovery of amounts owing in respect of the relevant Note or in respect of any breach by the Bank of any of its obligations or undertakings under the Note or the Trust Deed.
The Trustee shall not be bound to take any of the actions

<<<

 referred to in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Condition 11 to enforce the terms of the Trust Deed and/or the Notes or to take any other action under or pursuant to the Trust Deed unless (x) it shall have been so directed by an Extraordinary

<<<

 Resolution or so requested in writing by holders of Notes holding at least one-fifth in nominal amount of the Notes outstanding and (y) it shall have been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. No Noteholder or Couponholder may proceed

<<<

 directly against the Bank unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails to do so within a reasonable time and such failure is continuing, in which case the Noteholder or Couponholder shall have only such rights against the Bank

<<<

 as those which the Trustee is entitled to exercise.
12. Indemnification of Trustee
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility, including provisions relieving it from any

<<<

 obligation to take proceedings to enforce repayment or to take any other action under or pursuant to the Trust Deed unless indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. The Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions with the

<<<

 Bank or any of its subsidiaries without accounting for any profit resulting therefrom and to act as trustee for the holders of any other securities issued by the Bank or any of its subsidiaries.
13. Meetings of Noteholders; Modification; Waiver

<<<

; Substitution
The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders to consider any matter affecting their interests, including the modification by Extraordinary Resolution of these Conditions, the Trust Deed, the Notes

<<<

 or the Coupons. An Extraordinary Resolution is defined in the Trust Deed to mean a resolution passed by a majority of not less than 75 per cent. of the votes cast at a meeting or adjourned meeting of the Noteholders convened to consider the

<<<

 relevant Extraordinary Resolution. The quorum at any such meeting for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons present holding or representing a clear majority of the nominal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding

<<<

, or at any adjourned such meeting one or more persons present being or
48

representing Noteholders whatever the nominal amount of the Notes held or represented by them, except that at any meeting, the business of which includes, inter alia

<<<

, reduction of the amount of, or variation of the currency of or postponement of the date for payment of, principal or interest in respect of the Notes, or a change in the Trigger Level, the necessary quorum for passing an Extraordinary Resolution

<<<

 will be one or more persons present holding or representing not less than two-thirds, or at any adjourned such meeting not less than one-third, of the nominal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding.
Any resolution passed at any

<<<

 meeting of the Noteholders will be binding on all the Noteholders, whether or not they are present at the meeting, and on all the holders of the Coupons relating to the Notes.
The Trust Deed also (i) provides for a resolution in writing signed

<<<

 by or on behalf of all the Noteholders to be as effective and binding as if it were an Extraordinary Resolution duly passed at a meeting of the holders of the Notes and (ii) contains provisions for convening a meeting of the holders of the

<<<

 Notes and the holders of other series of Notes in certain circumstances where the Trustee so decides.
The Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, to any modification (subject to certain exceptions) of, or

<<<

 to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of these Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons or determine that any event which would or might otherwise be an Event of Default

<<<

 shall not be treated as such if, in the opinion of the Trustee, the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced thereby or to any modification which is of a formal, minor or technical nature or which is made to correct a

<<<

 manifest error. Any such modification, waiver, authorisation or determination shall be binding on the Noteholders and Couponholders and, unless the Trustee agrees otherwise, any such modification shall be notified to the Noteholders as soon

<<<

 as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 16.
The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, agree with the Bank to the substitution in place of the Bank (or of any previous substitute under this Condition

<<<

) as the principal debtor under the Notes and the Coupons and the Trust Deed of any Successor in Business (as defined in the Trust Deed) or any subsidiary of the Bank or any holding company of the Bank or any subsidiary of any such holding company

<<<

, subject to:
(i) the Notes being unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Bank, such guarantee being subordinated on a basis considered by the Trustee to be equivalent to that referred to in Condition 3, in respect of the Bank's obligations

<<<

 under the Notes;
(ii) the Trustee being satisfied that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution; and
(iii) certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed being complied with.
The Trustee shall

<<<

, in connection with the exercise by it of the powers, trusts, authorities and discretions (including but not limited to those in relation to any proposed modification, waiver, authorisation, determination, replacement, transfer or substitution

<<<

) vested in it by the Trust Deed or these Conditions, have regard to the interests of the Noteholders as a class and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, shall not have regard to the consequences of such exercise

<<<

 for individual Noteholders and Couponholders resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory and shall have absolute and uncontrolled

<<<

 discretion as to the exercise thereof and it shall be in no way responsible to the Noteholders, the Couponholders or the Bank for any loss, costs, damage, expenses or inconvenience which may result from the exercise or non-exercise thereof

<<<

.

14. Replacement of Notes, Coupons and Talons
Should any Note, Coupon or Talon be mutilated, defaced or destroyed or be lost or stolen, it may be replaced at the specified office of the Agent in London, United Kingdom (or such other place

<<<

 as may be notified to the Noteholders), in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred by the Bank and the Agent in connection therewith and on such terms as to evidence, indemnity

<<<

, security or otherwise as the Bank and the Agent may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Notes, Coupons or Talons must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.
15. Prescription
The Notes and Coupons will become void unless claims

<<<

 in respect of principal and/or interest are made within a period of ten years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 10) relating thereto. Any moneys paid by the Bank

<<<

 to the Agent for the payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes and remaining unclaimed for two years after the date on which such principal or interest shall have become due shall (at the Bank's request) be repaid by the Agent

<<<

 to the Bank, and the holders of the relevant Notes or Coupons shall thereafter only look to the Bank for any payment which such holders may be entitled to collect.
There shall not be included in any Coupon sheet issued on exchange of a Talon

<<<

 any Coupon the claim for payment in respect of which would be void pursuant to this Condition 15 or any Talon which would be void pursuant to Condition 7(b).
16. Notices
All notices regarding the Notes shall be published in one leading English

<<<

 language daily newspaper with circulation in London, United Kingdom or, if this is not practicable, one other English language daily newspaper with general circulation in Europe as the Trustee may approve. It is expected that publication of

<<<

 notices will normally be made in the Financial Times in London, United Kingdom. The Bank shall also ensure that notices are duly published in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or any other relevant

<<<

 authority on which the Notes are for the time being admitted to trading. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of the first publication or, if required to be published in more than one newspaper, on the date of the

<<<

 first publication in all the required newspapers.
Until such time as any definitive Notes are issued, there may, so long as the global Note(s) is or are held in its or their entirety on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, be substituted

<<<

 for such publication in such newspaper the delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg for communication by them to the holders of the Notes. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the holders of

<<<

 the Notes on the seventh day after the day on which the said notice was given to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.
Notices to be given by any holder of the Notes shall be in writing and given by lodging the same, together with the relative

<<<

 Note or Notes, with the Agent. Whilst any of the Notes are represented by a global Note, such notice may be given by any holder of a Note to the Agent via Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, in such manner as the Agent

<<<

 and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, may approve for this purpose.
17. Further Issues
The Bank shall be at liberty from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders to create and issue further

<<<

 notes ranking pari passu and having the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or in all respects save for the first payment of
50

interest thereon) and so that the same shall be consolidated and form a single Series with

<<<

 the other outstanding Notes. 18. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 No rights are conferred on any person under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Note, but this does not affect any right

<<<

 or remedy of any person which exists or is available apart from that Act. 19. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction The Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Notes, the Coupons and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection

<<<

 therewith shall be governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, English law, except that the provisions contained in Conditions 3 and 6 are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the Kingdom of Sweden

<<<

. The Bank has in the Trust Deed submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of England for all purposes in connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons. The address in England for service of process is the London branch of the

<<<

 Bank (being Central Head Office, 3 Thomas More Square, London E1W 1WY United Kingdom).

CAPITAL ADEQUACY
In 2007, the Act on Capital Adequacy and Large Exposures (<SW. lag (2006:1371) om kapitaltackning och stora exponeringar) was adopted

<<<

 to implement the Capital Requirements Directive (the "CRD") and the Basel II Requirements. The Act implemented transitional rules which were originally intended to expire after 2009 but have been extended until further notice. These transitional

<<<

 rules establish a floor for the capital requirement under Basel II rules and after 2009 the capital requirement may not be less than 80 per cent. of the capital requirements under Basel I rules.
The regulatory requirements demand that a bank

<<<

's capital base must cover operational, credit and market risk. The exposure to credit risk can, after approval from the Swedish Financial Services Agency (the "SFSA"), be calculated according to models that have been developed internally by

<<<

 the bank. The Bank has been approved by the SFSA to use internal risk classification models in this respect. These models allow for two different internal ratings-based approaches ("IRB"): the foundation approach and the advanced approach.

<<<

 The Bank uses the advanced approach for retail exposures (household and small companies) in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland and for its subsidiaries Stadshypotek AB, Handelsbanken Finans AB and Rahoitus Oy. In 2010, the Bank received permission

<<<

 from the SFSA to also report certain corporate portfolios according to the advanced approach where the counterparties are medium-sized companies, property companies and housing co-operative associations. In 2012, a supplementary application

<<<

 was submitted to the SFSA for large corporate exposures. The exposures that have been approved for reporting according to the IRB approach but not yet for the advanced approach are currently reported according to the foundation approach.
In

<<<

 2009, the European Commission proposed revisions to the CRD through a new directive 2009/111 ("CRD II"') in order to amend the CRD and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed revisions to the Basel II Capital Framework in response

<<<

 to the global financial crisis. CRD II came into effect from 30 June 2011. In 2010, further revisions to the CRD were adopted through Directive 2010/76/EU ("CRD III"). While certain provisions relating to remuneration reforms took effect from

<<<

 1 January 2011, CRD III was fully implemented by 31 December 2011.
On 16 December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the main Basel III rules for new capital and liquidity standards for banks. On 13 January 2011, the

<<<

 committee issued minimum requirements to ensure that all classes of regulatory capital instruments absorb losses before taxpayers when banks cease to be viable. The majority of the Basel III requirements are expected to be implemented in the

<<<

 participating countries between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2019. Trading and securitisation reforms were implemented in 2011 through the implementation of CRD III to the extent they were not already effective. In relation to globally systemically

<<<

 important banks ("GSIBs"'), on 4 November 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that such financial institutions should be subject to further buffer requirements to be phased in between 2016 and 2018. This is in line with

<<<

 the G20 communiqué following a meeting held on 18 and 19 February 2011, in which it referenced ongoing work regarding a comprehensive multi-pronged framework with more intensive supervisory oversight; effective resolution capacity, including

<<<

 in a cross-border context; higher loss absorbency measures that may include - depending on national circumstances capital surcharges, contingent capital and bail-in instruments, and other supplementary requirements as determined by the national

<<<

 authorities, including systemic levies.
On 27 June 2013, a revised European capital adequacy and liquidity framework based on the Basel III accord was officially published. The new framework includes one directive, 2013/36/EU ("CRD IV"), which

<<<

 must be transposed into national law, and one regulation, (EU) No. 575/2013 ("CRR"), which is directly applicable in all Member States of the EU. The changes to the capital adequacy framework include stricter minimum capital requirements for

<<<

 the components in the capital base with the highest quality, i.e., Common Equity Tier 1 capital ("CET1 capital") (4.5 per cent.) and Tier 1 capital (6.0 per cent.). The minimum capital requirement is unchanged at 8.0 per cent. In addition to

<<<

 the minimum capital requirements, new buffer requirements are also introduced. The framework also introduces new capital buffers: (i) the capital conservation buffer, (ii) the institution-specific
52

countercyclical buffer, (ii) the global

<<<

 systemically important institutions buffer, (iv) the other systemically important institutions buffer and (v) the systemic risk buffer. The Bank is currently subject to 2.5 per cent. capital conservation buffer requirement. Breach of the combined

<<<

 buffer requirement will result in restrictions on certain capital distributions from the relevant institution, for example, dividend and coupon payments on CET1 and Tier 1 capital instruments. The new requirements under CRD IV and CRR are applicable

<<<

 as of 1 January 2014. The above mentioned Basel I transitional floors have been extended by the CRR until 31 December 2017, but may be waived by national supervisory authorities under certain conditions.
In Sweden, the SFSA announced on 18

<<<

 March 2014 that the Basel I transitional floors will not be waived. The legislation package implementing CRD IV into Swedish law was adopted on 25 June 2014, and is applicable as of 2 August 2014. These primary legislative texts include the

<<<

 Supervision of Credit and Investment Institutions Act (Sw. lag (2014:968) om särskild tillsyn över kreditinstitut och värdepappersbolag) and the Capital Buffers Act (Sw. lag (2014:966) om kapitalbuffertar). In connection therewith, the Act

<<<

 on Capital Adequacy and Large Exposures has been repealed. The Supervision of Credit and Investment Institutions Act, which regulates how the supervision of credit institutions and securities companies shall be exercised, assumes certain provisions

<<<

 of the Act on Capital Adequacy and Large Exposures and complements the CRR. The Capital Buffers Act stipulates that credit institutions and securities companies shall hold various capital buffers in addition to the fundamental capital requirements

<<<

 and enables intervention by the SFSA should such institution or company not fulfil a buffer requirement.

The Swedish Ministry of Finance, the SFSA and the Riksbank announced in November 2011 that capital standards higher than the minimum set

<<<

 forth in the Basel III framework and the CRD IV proposal would be required from domestic systemically important banks ("D-SIBs"). On 10 September 2014, the SFSA announced that this would be achieved through the four major Swedish banks, including

<<<

 the Group, being assigned a systemic risk buffer of 3.0 per cent. of their CET1 capital as of 1 January 2015. A further 2.0 per cent. CET1 capital requirement will apply within the framework of Pillar 2. This clarifies the composition of the

<<<

 previously announced requirement to hold 12.0 per cent CET1 capital ratio as of 1 January 2015.

Furthermore, and in addition to the capital requirements mentioned above, pursuant to the announcement on 10 September 2014, the SFSA considers

<<<

 that given current economic conditions, the countercyclical capital buffer should be activated in Sweden. A buffer level for exposures in Sweden of 1 per cent., will be applicable from 13 September 2015. Moreover, the risk weight floor for

<<<

 Swedish mortgages will be raised from the current level of 15 to 25 per cent. within the framework of Pillar 2. Additionally the same risk weight floor will apply to exposures arising from the Norwegian mortgage loan market. As at the date

<<<

 of this Offering Circular, and according to the SFSA announcement, the Group meets the proposed new capital requirements.

The Basel III Non-Viability Requirements form part of the broader Basel III package and will be implemented in the European

<<<

 Economic Area by way of the BRRD. If such statutory loss absorption at the point of non-viability is not implemented by 31 December 2015 then CRR indicates that the European Commission shall review and report on whether a provision should be

<<<

 included in CRR and, in light of that review, come forward with appropriate legislative proposals.

In June 2014, the Swedish government announced that it would introduce legislation to implement the BRRD in Sweden, including provisions on

<<<

 loss absorption at the point of non-viability. As at the date of this Offering Circular, this legislation has not been enacted.

The following table sets forth an analysis of the Group's capital adequacy as of the dates indicated:

TAXATION
Swedish Taxation
The following summary outlines

<<<

 certain Swedish tax consequences relating to holders o f the Notes. The summary is based on the laws o f the Kingdom o f Sweden as currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only. The summary does not address, inter

<<<

 alia, situations where the Notes are held in an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto), the tax consequences in connection with a Write Down o f the Notes, the tax consequences following variation or substitution (instead o

<<<

 f redemption) o f the Notes or the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers o f interest. Investors should consult their professional tax advisers regarding the Swedish tax and other tax consequences (including the applicability

<<<

 and effect o f tax treaties for the avoidance o f double taxation) o facquiring, owning and disposing o f the Notes in their particular circumstances.
Holders not resident in the Kingdom of Sweden
Payments of any principal amount or any amount

<<<

 that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to the holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder (i) is not resident in the Kingdom of Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and (ii) does

<<<

 not have a permanent establishment in the Kingdom of Sweden to which the Notes are effectively connected.
However, broadly speaking, provided that the value of or the return on the Notes relates to securities taxed as shares, private individuals

<<<

 who have been residents of the Kingdom of Sweden or have had a habitual abode in the Kingdom of Sweden at any time during the calendar year of disposal or redemption or the ten calendar years preceding the year of disposal or redemption, are

<<<

 liable for capital gains taxation in the Kingdom of Sweden upon disposal or redemption of such Notes. In a number of cases though, the applicability of this rule is limited by the applicable tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation.

<<<


Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes, except for certain payments of interest (and other returns on Notes

<<<

) to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) who is resident in the Kingdom of Sweden for Swedish tax purposes (see "Holders resident in the Kingdom of Sweden" below).
Holders resident in the Kingdom of Sweden
In general

<<<

, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) with residence in the Kingdom of Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, all capital income (for example, income that is considered to be interest for Swedish

<<<

 tax purposes and capital gains on Notes) will be taxable. Specific tax consequences may be applicable to certain categories of corporations, for example, life insurance companies. Further, specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and

<<<

 to the extent that, a holder of Notes realises a capital loss on the Notes and to any currency exchange gains or losses.
If amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in the Kingdom

<<<

 of Sweden, including a Swedish branch, to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) with residence in the Kingdom of Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld by the legal entity on

<<<

 such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes should normally also be withheld on other returns on Notes (but not capital gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to above.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance

<<<

 Act
Sweden and the United States ("U.S.") have reached an agreement in substance to enter into an intergovernmental agreement (an "IGA") to help implement Sections 1471 through 1474 of FATCA, for certain Swedish entities. If the IGA is entered

<<<

 into as agreed in substance, payments of U.S.
55

source income to Swedish "financial institutions", as defined under the IGA, including the Bank, would not be subject to FATCA withholding provided that they are in compliance with the IGA

<<<

. However, the Bank and other Swedish "financial institutions" would be required to report certain information regarding their respective U.S. account holders to the government of Sweden, which information may ultimately be reported to the U

<<<

.S. Internal Revenue Service. Although U.S. Treasury Regulations implementing FATCA impose a 30 per cent U.S. withholding tax on all or a portion of payments of principal and interest on the Notes that are treated as "foreign passthru payments

<<<

", the IGA, if entered into, currently would not require withholding on foreign passthru payments. However, there can be no assurance that Sweden and the United States will in fact enter into an IGA.
If an amount in respect of FATCA were to

<<<

 be deducted or withheld from interest, principal or other payments made in respect of the Notes, neither the Bank nor any paying agent nor any other person would, pursuant to the conditions of the Notes, be required to pay additional amounts

<<<

 as a result of the deduction or withholding. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected.
FATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on

<<<

 regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented or entered into in a materially different form. Prospective investors should consult their professional tax advisers on how these rules

<<<

 may apply to the Bank and to payments they may receive in connection with the Notes.
The EUSavings Directive
Under Directive 2003/48/EC, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain

<<<

 payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State

<<<

.
On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes

<<<

 will expand the range of payments covered by Directive 2003/48/EC, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. Directive 2003/48/EC will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit

<<<

 an individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases

<<<

 apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the EU.
For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation

<<<

 to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding under such system assuming such withholding system is still operated when the changes are implemented.
The end of the transitional period

<<<

 is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system

<<<

 in the case of Switzerland).
56

The proposed Financial Transactions Tax ("FTT") On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia

<<<

, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States"). The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary

<<<

 market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of the Notes should, however, be exempt. Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating

<<<

 Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed

<<<

 to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings

<<<

 is issued in a participating Member State. A joint statement issued in May 2014 by ten of the eleven participating Member States indicated an intention to implement the FTT progressively, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain

<<<

 derivatives, with this initial implementation occurring by 1 January 2016. The FTT, as initially implemented on this basis, may not apply to dealings in the Notes. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member

<<<

 States and is the subject of legal challenge. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective Noteholders are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation

<<<

 to the FTT.

SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE
The Joint Lead Managers have, in the Syndication Agreement dated 24 February 2015, which is made pursuant to the amended and restated programme agreement dated 13 June 2014, jointly and severally agreed

<<<

 to subscribe for the Notes at a price of 100.00 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes. The Bank has also agreed to reimburse the Joint Lead Managers for certain of their expenses in connection with the issue of Notes.
United States

<<<


The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in certain transactions exempt from the registration

<<<

 requirements of the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the

<<<

 United States or its possessions or to a United States person, except in certain transactions permitted by U.S. tax regulations. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Treasury

<<<

 regulations thereunder. The Notes are subject to the requirements of the TEFRA C rules.
Each Joint Lead Manager has agreed that it will not offer, sell or deliver any Notes (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until

<<<

 40 days after the completion of the distribution of such Notes, as determined and certified by the relevant Joint Lead Manager, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons. Each Joint Lead Manager has further

<<<

 agreed that it will send to each dealer or any other purchaser to which it sells any Notes during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United

<<<

 States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.
In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer

<<<

 or sale of Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
Public Offer Selling Restriction under the Prospectus Directive
In relation

<<<

 to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), each Joint Lead Manager has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the

<<<

 Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date") it has not made and will not make an offer of Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this Offering Circular to the public

<<<

 in that Relevant Member State other than:
(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;
(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus

<<<

 Directive), subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Issuer; or
(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,
provided that no such offer of Notes shall require the Issuer or any Joint Lead Manager
