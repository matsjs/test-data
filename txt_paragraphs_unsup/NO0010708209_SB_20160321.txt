Oslo, 21 March 2016

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING

Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bond issue Harkand Finance Inc. Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue

<<<

 2014/2019 with ISIN NO 001 070820.9 (the "Bond Issue") issued by Harkand Finance Inc. (the "Issuer") pursuant to the bond agreement dated 27 March 2014 (the "Bond Agreement"), and amended and restated on 7 July 2015, between, amongst others

<<<

, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee.

All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement unless otherwise stated.

The Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting to consider

<<<

 a request for amendments to the Bond Agreement as set out herein.

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and the Proposal (as defined below) is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever

<<<

 related to such information.

1

Background

The Issuer is part of the Harkand group (the "Group"), which is in the business of owning and chartering vessels. The Issuer issued the Bonds to the Bondholders on 28 March 2014 and used the proceeds

<<<

 of the Bonds to finance (in part) the purchase price of the Vessels. The Vessels were acquired by Subsidiaries of the Issuer and are currently on charter to other members of the Group.

Due to the current challenging market environment, the

<<<

 Group has been pro-actively engaging with certain of its largest Bondholders (the "Significant Bondholders") and other creditors as part of ongoing efforts to improve its near-term working capital and liquidity situation.

The Group is currently

<<<

 negotiating with certain of the Significant Bondholders the terms of amendments to the Bond Agreement and certain Finance Documents with an aim to alleviate the Group's liquidity constraints, caused by its significant cash interest payments

<<<

 due in the near term. The Issuer hereby informs that the interest payment due 28 March 2016 will not be paid due to insufficient liquidity. The Group has been in constructive discussions with the Significant Bondholders and it is expected that

<<<

 a term sheet will be circulated shortly.

The Proposal

2.1 To assist in achieving an expedient implementation of proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement, the Issuer proposes to amend the Bond Agreement as follows (the "Proposal I"):


<<<


(a) to allow future waivers and amendments to the Bond Agreement and the Finance Documents to be resolved by way of written resolution, without needing to convene a

(b) to reduce the notice period in Clause 16.2.4 of the Bond Agreement from ten (10) Business

<<<

 Days to five (5) Business Days.

2.2 The Issuer further proposes that the Bondholders' Meeting resolve that the Bond Trustee may appoint (i) Advokatfirmaet BA-HR DA, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, HK Law and Triay & Triay as legal counsel

<<<

, such appointment having been approved by simple majority of Bondholders prior to the date of these summons, (ii) other legal counsel in any relevant jurisdiction, and (iii) AMA Capital Partners as financial advisors, such appointment having
