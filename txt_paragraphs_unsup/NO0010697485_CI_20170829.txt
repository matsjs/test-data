, whose main activity consists of financing of the group entities. Bluewater Holding B.V. is wholly owned by Aurelia Energy N.V., which published its half year results for the period ended June 30, 2017 on August 22, 2017.
For the first half

<<<

 year 2017, the Bluewater group, headed by Aurelia Energy N.V., reported a net loss after tax amounting to U.S.$7.1 million compared to a profit of U.S.$43.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. EBITDA for the six-month period

<<<

 ended June 30, 2017 was U.S.$74.7 million compared to U.S.$126.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016.
Second quarter results Bluewater Holding N.V. The net result after tax of Bluewater Holding N.V. for the six-month period

<<<

 ended June 30, 2017 was U.S.$7.1 million loss compared to U.S.$43.3 million profit for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 was U.S.$74.7 million compared to U.S.$126.2 million for the

<<<

 six-month period ended June 30, 2016. The financial results for the first half year 2017 were mainly impacted by the following:
The SPM division generated U.S.$15.8 million EBITDA in the second quarter of 2017, resulting in U.S.$17.7 million

<<<

 EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to U.S.$24.8 million EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. In 2017, progress on the running SPM projects is in final stages, resulting in lower EBITDA recognition compared

<<<

 to the year 2016. The Company has recently concluded a contract for the delivery of 3 buoy systems. Delivery of these buoy systems is expected by Q1 2018. For the first half year of 2017 this project has not contributed to the result.
EBITDA

<<<

 for the FPSO division in the second quarter of 2017 amounted to U.S.$30.8 million, resulting in U.S.$62.9 million EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to U.S.$107.7 million EBITDA for the six-month period ended June

<<<

 30, 2016. The U.S.$44.8 million decrease in EBITDA compared to the first half year of 2016 was mainly driven by a U.S.$34.3 million decrease in EBITDA for the FPSO Glas Dowr. This decrease in EBITDA is due to the recognition of the largest

<<<

 part of the termination fee following the termination for convenience by ENI in 2016 compared to the lay-up of the vessel in the first half year of 2017. EBITDA of the FPSO Aoka Mizu reduced by U.S.$12.2 million. FPSO Aoka Mizu stopped production

<<<

 from the Ettrick field on June 1,2016. EBITDA for the FPSO Haewene Brim decreased by U.S.$1.1 million compared to the first half year of 2016. This decrease was caused by credits on the lease in 2017. EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm increased

<<<

 by U.S.$0.6 million due to higher tariff income in the first half year of 2017 compared to the first half year of 2016. EBITDA of the FPSO Munin increased by U.S.$1.1 million as a result of cost savings on the lay-up of the vessel in the first

<<<

 half year of 2017 compared to the first half year of 2016. Finally FPSO tender costs in the first half year of 2017 decreased by U.S.$1.1 million, despite the increase in number of tender prospects in 2017.
During the first half year of 20

<<<

17, unallocated expenses amounted to U.S.$5.9 million, compared to U.S.$6.3 million for the first half year of 2016. The unallocated expenses for the first half year of 2016 include a reorganization provision of U.S.$1.3 million. Because of

<<<

 the lower number of contracted staff in the first half year of 2017 the overall recovery percentage also decreased. In the first half year of 2016 the overhead recovery was slightly higher than the first half year of 2017, which was driven

<<<

 by higher project activity and utilization of the engineering staff.
2

Depreciation and amortization expenditure in the first half year of 2017 amounted to U.S.$54.1 million compared to U.S.$55.5 million in the first half year of 2016. Decommissioning

<<<

 of FPSO Glas Dowr was completed on March 1,2016 and decommissioning of FPSO Aoka Mizu on August 1,2016. As from these dates the FPSOs are classified as `FPSOs held for conversion' and are depreciated on an adjusted depreciation rate after the

<<<

 reassessment of the anticipated useful life.
Finance expenses were U.S.$2.4 million lower compared to the previous year, at U.S.$27.3 million versus U.S.$29.7 million in the first half year of 2016. The amendment agreements to the senior secured

<<<

 project finance facility and corporate credit facility have led to one-off additional amortization expenditures of debt arrangement fees of U.S.$1.3 million due to recalculation of the debt arrangement fees over the remainder period of the

<<<

 facilities in 2016. In total an amount of U.S.$6.5 million was added to the debt arrangement fees. Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$3.7 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to further reduction of net debt.
Currency exchange

<<<

 results were U.S.$0.9 million negative in the first half year of 2017 compared to U.S.$3.0 million positive in the first half year of 2016. The currency exchange results relate mainly to positive or negative fair market value of euro denominated

<<<

 forward exchange contracts that were entered into to hedge the currency exposure on SPM projects.
Income tax benefit for the first half year of 2017 amounted U.S.$0.3 million versus U.S.$0.8 million income tax expense for the first half year

<<<

 of 2016. The income tax expense in 2016 mainly relates to withholding tax and Australian corporate tax in relation to Glas Dowr. The U.S.$0.3 million income tax benefit in 2017 relates mainly to refunds as a result of recalculation of Glas

<<<

 Dowr corporate income tax paid in prior years.
Other developments
On November 28, 2016, the Company has signed a Heads of Terms with Hurricane Energy, a UK based oil and gas-company focused on hydrocarbon resources in naturally fractured basement

<<<

 reservoirs, for the use of the Aoka Mizu FPSO on the Lancaster field, West of Shetland. Following the signing of the Agreement, the Company and Hurricane have substantially concluded the second phase FEED study at the end of March, 2017. Under

<<<

 the terms of the Agreement, the Company and Hurricane have granted each other an exclusive right to enter into fully-termed agreements until November 2017, parties expect to enter into the agreements prior to Hurricane's expected sanction date

<<<

 in mid-2017. On April 4, 2017, the bondholders were served with a notice of a written resolution to permit the implementation of the head of terms with Hurricane and related bond amendments. On April 11,2017, The Nordic Trustee ASA confirmed

<<<

 that the proposed resolution was passed with the requisite majority of voting bonds voting in favour of the proposed resolution and therefore the bond agreement will be changed as set out in the notice. On May 3, 2017, the project finance facility

<<<

 lenders consented to enter into a Hurricane letter of quiet enjoyment and bond coupon increase. Subsequently, Hurricane agreed to authorize the Company to procure long lead items in order to keep the project on schedule to deliver first oil

<<<

 by end of 1H 2019. On June 23, 2017, the Company and Hurricane Energy plc (``Hurricane'') reached agreement on the key contracts outlining terms for the upgrade, lease and operation of the FPSO Aoka Mizu (``Transaction Documents'') in connection

<<<

 with the Early Production System on Hurricane's Lancaster Field (``Lancaster EPS''). On June 30, 2017, Hurricane announced a fundraising of U.S.$530.0 million to fund capital expenditure in relation to the Lancaster EPS. The Transaction Documents

<<<

 became effective in accordance with their terms on August 14, 2017.
On June 30, 2017, Repsol Sinopec Resources UK Limited gave notice of extending the firm period of the bareboat charter for FPSO Bleo Holm at unchanged charter terms. The firm

<<<

 contract period now runs up until June 30, 2019.
In the SPM Segment, the Company has recently commenced works for the delivery of 3 buoy systems, with delivery of these buoy systems being expected by Q2 2018.

The corporate facility that

<<<

 was scheduled to mature on March 31,2017 has been extended till September 15, 2017, however, the availability under the facility has reduced to U.S.$5.0 million until a new lender or lenders are found. The Company is in advanced discussions

<<<

 with a new RCF lender to provide available drawing room by stepping into the existing RCF structure.
Given the current business outlook and the liquidity forecast as well as the available options to secure funding, the Company expects to be

<<<

 in compliance with its covenants under the existing loan agreements (including the Corporate Facility, the Project Finance Facility and the Bond Loan).
General information
Bluewater Holding B.V. (``the Company'') is an intermediary holding

<<<

 company of the Bluewater group (Bluewater), a specialized service provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates floating production storage and offloading units (``FPSOs''), provides

<<<

 auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops, performs project management and constructs single point mooring systems (``SPMs''). The Company is wholly owned by Aurelia Energy N.V., which published its half year results for

<<<

 the period ended June 30, 2017 on August 22, 2017.
An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either newly built or converted tankers

<<<

 upon which production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and water) are processed onboard the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported by an off take system utilizing shuttle tankers. Bluewater's fleet

<<<

 of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling, phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- or long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts.
SPMs are used to transfer

<<<

 fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker while securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. Most SPMs consist of an anchoring system that is connected to the ocean floor and a fluid

<<<

 transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids between fixed and rotating parts of the mooring system. SPMs are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors.
Revenues are earned from day rates consisting of a fixed

<<<

 facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases with oil companies, supplemented from time to time with fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable

<<<

 basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed.
FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial design and engineering phase to final installation

<<<

. Further, Bluewater engages subcontractors in the fabrication of FPSOs, SPMs and auxiliary equipment.

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Reporting entity Bluewater Holding B.V. (``the Company'') has its legal seat in Hoofddorp, the Netherlands. The unaudited

<<<

 condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ``the Group'' or ``Bluewater'' and individually as

<<<

 ``Group entities'') and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities.
Statement of compliance The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International

<<<

 Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements.
Basis of preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, which is the

<<<

 Company's functional currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared based on the same accounting policies and methods

<<<

 as those of the annual financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017. The information furnished in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments

<<<

 which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of such financial statements. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these

<<<

 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 30, 2016.
The preparation of these unaudited interim financial statements

<<<

 requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates

<<<

 and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, significant areas of estimation

<<<

 uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the unaudited interim financial statements are:
 Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on

<<<

 the percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned with the leased facilities;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forward;  Potential impact of claims and litigation

<<<

;  Going concern considerations.
1. Segment reporting
The disclosure of segment information is consistent with the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segment's performance

<<<

 and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments since the Company's risks and rates of return are affected primarily by differences in services and products produced.
Segment results, assets and

<<<

 liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly employee benefits expense, head office expenses, investments and related revenue and

<<<

 income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues.
