 Bond Issue 2011/2015 (ISIN NO 001 0614217)
Oslo, 9 April 2014

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - REQUEST FOR WAIVER

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned

<<<

 bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where Global Rig Company ASA (the "Issuer") is the issuer.

All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 8 June 2011 and made between the Bond Trustee and

<<<

 the Issuer (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. References to Clauses and paragraphs are references to Clauses and paragraphs of the Bond Agreement.

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions

<<<

 are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1

BACKGROUND

Reference is made to the bondholders' meeting held 2 January 2014 in which the bondholders granted a

<<<

 waiver in relation to the Issuer's entry into of a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with National Oilwell Varco, L.P. ("NOV") regarding delivery of three AC Ideal Rig Equipment Packages (the "New Rigs") from NOV.

Upon entering

<<<

 into of the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer paid a non-refundable deposit in the amount of USD 2,000,000, which, if the Issuer takes delivery of the New Rigs, will be set-off against the purchase price for the New Rigs. Under the Purchase Agreement

<<<

, a second installment of USD 1,000,000 was paid on 15 February 2014 and a third installment (the "Third Instalment") of USD 12,714,000 shall be paid no later than May 1, 2014 as partial payment for the New Rigs.

In the event that the Issuer

<<<

 does not provide to NOV the full payment of the New Rigs within the timeline agreed in the Purchase Agreement, NOV has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement without fault or penalty to either party.

The Issuer believes that purchasing

<<<

 the New Rigs is commercially beneficial to the Issuer, its shareholders and its creditors, as it will allow the Issuer to potentially increase cash flows and generate profits to the Issuer as well as providing for a more solid operational platform

<<<

 for the Issuer.

Over the past months, the Issuer has been working on refinancing of the Bond Loan with issuance of a new bond loan in the amount of USD 120 million (the "New Bond Loan"). The New Bond Loan will,

in addition to refinance the Bond Loan, be used to take delivery of the New Rigs. However, the

<<<

 fire incident involving the Group's Rig#24 has caused a delay in the refinancing work, and the Issuer has therefore been required to consider alternative solutions in order to meet its payment obligations under the Purchase Agreement. On this

<<<

 basis, the Issuer has entered into an underwriting agreement with Franklin Enterprises whereby Franklin Enterprises irrevocably undertakes to subscribe for such number of bonds as are allotted to it in the New Bond Loan in order to ensure full

<<<

 subscription of the New Bond Loan (the "Underwriting"). As consideration for the Underwriting, Franklin Enterprises will receive an amount equal to 1.5% of USD 120 million payable upon settlement of the New Bond Loan.

Furthermore, in order

<<<

 to be able to settle the Third Instalment on 1 May 2014, the Issuer contemplates the entry into a of short term loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with Franklin Enterprises in the amount of USD 13 million. As security under the Loan Agreement

<<<

, the Issuer will assign its rights under the Purchase Contract to Franklin Enterprises.

Payment of the Third Installment and entry into of the Loan Agreement would be prohibited by the following covenants in the Loan Agreement:

a) paragraph

<<<

 (j) of Clause 13.4 (No investments), pursuant to which investments can only be undertaken so long as at least 40% is financed by new equity;

b) paragraph (i) of Clause 13.4 (Financial Indebtedness), pursuant to which the Issuer shall ensure

<<<

 that the Rig Owning Subsidiaries and the Rig Manager shall not incur or permit to remain outstanding any Financial Indebtedness (whether secured or unsecured) other than as set out in such Clause;

c) paragraph (1) of Clause 13.4 (Negative

<<<

 pledge), pursuant to which the Issuer shall ensure that the Guarantors shall not create, incur or allow to exist any Encumbrance on any of their assets except the Security Interest; and

d) Clause 13.6.1 and 13.6.2 {The Issuer's Earnings Account

<<<

 and The Rig Manager's Earnings Account), pursuant to which the Issuer the Rig Manager are not allowed to utilize any of their cash flow generated from operations of the current rigs for other purposes than those set out in such Clauses.

On

<<<

 this basis, the Issuer wishes to request that the Bondholders' Meeting waives the restrictions set out in the Clauses set out in a) to d) above to allow the Issuer to enter into the Loan Agreement and make the Third Installment. No changes

<<<

 will be made to the other covenants set out in the Bond Agreement, and the Issuer will only take delivery of and pay the balance of the purchase price for the New Rigs in compliance with the terms of the Bond Agreement.

The Issuer has discussed

<<<

 the proposed waiver with certain of the larger Bondholders, and Bondholders holding in aggregate more than 50% of the Bond have confirmed that they will vote in favour of the proposal.
