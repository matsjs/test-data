Summons to Bondholders

' Meeting

Oslo, 30 January 2016

Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") is appointed as trustee for the above mentioned Bond Issue, issued by GlobalConnenct A/S (the "Issuer").

All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned

<<<

 to them in the bond agreement dated 14 May 2013 (the "Bond Agreement") as amended from time to time, unless otherwise stated herein.

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and

<<<

 the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1. Background

On 20 December 2016 the EQT Infrastructure investment strategy ("EQT Infrastructure"), through Skynet Invest ApS, and the shareholders

<<<

 of the Issuer signed a share sale and purchase agreement pursuant to which Skynet Invest ApS agreed to purchase 100% of the shares in the Issuer (the "Acquisition"). At completion of the Acquisition, the founding Zibrandtsen family will reinvest

<<<

 part of its proceeds in the new holding structure of the Issuer obtaining a 20% indirect ownership of the Issuer and enter into a strategic partnership with EQT Infrastructure. The closing of the Acquisition (the "Acquisition Closing") is subject

<<<

 to certain customary closing conditions (including clearance from the competition authorities in Germany (which has been obtained) and Austria and Denmark (which are pending)) and is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2017 on or around

<<<

 28 February 2017. Skynet Invest ApS expects to refinance the outstanding indebtedness of the Issuer (including the Bond Issue).

Under the call option in the Amended and Restated Bond Agreement between the Issuer, the companies named therein

<<<

 as Guarantors, and the Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders in respect of the Bonds (the "Bond Agreement"), the Issuer is permitted to redeem .the Bond Issue (in whole but not in part) at a price of 104.00% of par value (plus accrued interest

<<<

 on the redeemed Bonds) during the period commencing on 15 November 2017 and ending on 15 May 2018. The Issuer is not permitted to voluntarily redeem the Bond Issue prior to 15 November 2017.

Therefore, in order to permit the refinancing of

<<<

 the Bond Issue on or after the Acquisition Closing, the Issuer proposes (the "Proposal") that the Bondholders approve a right of the Issuer to redeem the Bond Issue (in whole but not in part) early (the "Early Redemption") on the condition

<<<

 that the Acquisition Closing occurs.

The redemption price required to be paid by the Issuer for the Early Redemption (the "Early Redemption Price") is described in the proposed Resolution below and, for the period up to (and excluding) 16

<<<

 October 2017) is higher than the redemption price required to be paid by the Issuer to

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1. Oslo

redeem the Bond Issue by way of the Call Option during the first Call Option

<<<

 period (i.e. from (and including) 15 November 2017 to (but excluding) 15 May 2018) (the "First Call Option Price", being 104.00% of par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed Bonds)). From (and including) 16 October 2017 the Early Redemption

<<<

 Price is equal to the First Call Option Price.

To enable the Issuer to implement the Proposal, the Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to summon a meeting of the Bondholders (the "Bondholders' Meeting") to consider the approval of the Proposal

<<<

.

This Summons to the Bondholders' Meeting is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable.
