 Bond Issue 2011/2016

Oslo, 4 September 2012
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as loan trustee for the abovementioned bond loans - all of which are documented in an amended and restated loan agreement dated

<<<

 10 March 2011 (as amended, amended and restated and supplemented, the "Loan Agreement").
Capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Loan Agreement.
When used herein 

<<<

"Tranche" shall mean each of or any of (as the context requires) the Tranche A Loan, the Tranche B Loan, the Tranche Cl Loan and the Tranche C2 Loan
The information in this summons regarding the Borrowers and market conditions are provided by

<<<

 the Borrowers, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 Background
The Borrowers have been working towards resolving the situation at Davie Yard with the aim of completing the construction

 of the Vessels. As further described in the notification made by the Parent Borrower on 4 June 2012 (available on: www.oslobors.no), one of the partners in

NORSK TILLITSMANN

the effort to complete the Vessels has regrettably decided to withdraw from the project. Discussions with new potential yard partners are ongoing

<<<

. This delay in startup will have an impact on the financial situation of the Borrowers as the new financing and re-financing arrangements that were to be put in place together with the new construction contracts will be equally delayed. Due

<<<

 to these circumstances, the Borrowers are of the view that it would not be prudent to make the full cash interest payments due on the Loans on 18 September 2012. In line with the priority and waterfall provisions of Clause 8 {Status o f the

<<<

 Loan and Security) of the Loan Agreement, interest on the Tranche A Bonds will be paid as scheduled, however the Borrowers propose to the Bondholders that the interest due on 18 September 2012 on the Tranche B Bonds and the Tranche C Bonds

<<<

 be settled by payment-in-kind.

Proposal

Based on the above, the Borrowers hereby proposes the following to the Bondholders in each Tranche (the "Proposal"):

The Bondholders resolve as follows:
(a) the Bondholders waive:
(i) their right

<<<

 to treat the non-payment of interest due on the Tranche B Bonds and the Tranche C Bonds on September 2012 as an Event of Default and to take action in respect thereof as set out in Clause 15 {Events o f Default) of the Loan Agreement; and.

<<<


(ii) their right to receive default interest under Clause 11.4 {Default Interest) of the Loan Agreement as a result o f the Event o f Default described in (a)(i) above,
provided that:
(A) the interest due on the Tranche B Bonds and the Tranche

<<<

 C Bonds shall be paid in kind by issuing additional Tranche B Bonds to the Bondholders in the Tranche B Loan and by issuing additional Tranche C Bonds to the Bondholders in the Tranche C Loan (calculated (i) based on the total number of Tranche

<<<

 B Bonds and Tranche C Bonds respectively of each Bondholder and rounded down to the nearest USD 1.00 and (ii) on the basis of the rate of interest determined according to Clause 9 {Interest) of the Loan Agreement for the Tranche B Bonds and

<<<

 Tranche C Bonds for the three month period ending on 18 September 2012), and in each case added to the principal amount of the Tranche B Loan and the Tranche C Loan respectively (such additional principal to accrue interest from and including

<<<

 18 September 2012 at a rate equal to the rate calculated in accordance with Clause 9 {Interest) of the Loan Agreement); and
(B) save as expressly set out above, the provisions of the Finance Documents shall continue in full force and effect

<<<

 and none of the rights and remedies of the
