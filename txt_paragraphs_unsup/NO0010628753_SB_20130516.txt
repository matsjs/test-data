 ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the abovementioned Bond Issues, which are documented in bond agreements dated (i) 16 November 2011 in respect of the 2016 Bond Issue (the "2016 Bond Agreement") and (ii) 8 June 2012 in respect

<<<

 of the 2015 Bond Issue (the "2015 Bond Agreement") (each also referred to as a "Bond Agreement" and jointly as the "Bond Agreements"). Songa Offshore SE is the issuer of the Bonds (the "Issuer").
Capitalised terms used and not otherwise defined

<<<

 herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Bond Agreements or any Finance Document, as the context requires.
The information in this summons regarding the legal, operational and financial status of the Issuer is provided

<<<

 by the Issuer. The Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever arising from such information provided by the Issuer.
1. Proposal
1.1 Background Pursuant to Clause 13.5 (f) of each Bond Agreement, the Issuer shall ensure

<<<

 that the Group maintains a Leverage Ratio equal to or lower than 4.0:1 for the financial year 2013 and thereafter. The Issuer has during first quarter 2013 had ongoing discussions with its auditors about revenue recognition on Songa Trym and

<<<

 Songa Delta relating to contribution from client specific portions of the rig upgrade and life enhancement. Although still ongoing, the conclusion so far is that this has resulted in lower than expected revenues, implying that there is a minor

<<<

 breach of the leverage ratio covenants. To remedy such situation the Issuer wishes to put forward the Proposal (as defined below). The Issuer has retained Swedbank First Securities and Pareto Securities AS as its financial advisors with respect

<<<

 to the Proposal.
The Issuer requests that the Bondholders' Meeting resolves certain temporary adjustments to the Bond Agreements on certain terms and conditions (the "Proposal"):

<<<

 Agreement:

(a)

for the (i) financial reporting periods ending on 31 March 2013, 30 June 2013 and 30

September 2013, and (ii) for the period ending 30 December 2013, the Issuer shall ensure

 than 4.0:1 on 30 September 2013; and (ii) if subsequently

the Leverage Ratio of the Group exceeds 4.0:1, it shall be an Event of Default.

provide

numbers shall have been perused by the Issuer's auditor at the best of his abilities, in order

to test the LTM Pro Forma Leverage Ratio (as defined below) on 31 October

 2013, 30

November 2013, and 31 December 2013 and the Advisor shall thereafter provide the test

Please find attached a Bondholder's form from the Securities Register (VPS), indicating your holding of Bonds at the printing date. The form will serve as proof of ownership of Bonds and of the voting

<<<

 rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. If the Bonds are held by a custodian, i.e. that the owner is not registered directly in the VPS, the custodian must confirm: (i) the owner of the Bonds; (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds; and

<<<

 (iii) the account number in VPS in which the Bonds are registered. The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's form,

<<<

 authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this summons for further details).
If the Bonds have

<<<

 been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's form was completed, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof

<<<

 of the ownership of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or email (as set out

<<<

 on the first page of this summons) within 16:00 hours (A p.m.) CET on the Business Day before the date of the Bondholders' Meeting.
