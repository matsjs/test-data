SECOND SUMMONS REPLACING THE FIRST SUMMONS DATED 18 SEPTEMBER 2014 WHICH HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESS RELEASE DATED 3 OCTOBER 2014 SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - REQUEST TO AMEND THE TERMS

<<<

 AND CONDITIONS OF THE BONDS Nordic Trustee ASA (formerly known as Norsk Tillitsmann ASA) (the "Bond Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the " 12.25 % PA Resources AB Senior Unsecured Callable Bond Issue

<<<

 2011/2016" with ISIN: NO 001060572.8 (the "Bond Issue"), where PA Resources AB (publ) is the issuer (the "Issuer").
All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meanings assigned

<<<

 thereto in the agreement, as amended, for the Bond Issue (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this Summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever

<<<

 related to such information.
To enable the Issuer to conduct the proposed changes of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes. This summons

<<<

 replaces in its entirety the summons which was sent to the Bondholders on 18 September 2014. as such previous summons has been withdrawn in accordance with the press release dated 3 October 2014, 1. BACKGROUND AND CORPORATE UPDATE
In recent

<<<

 years, PA Resources has struggled to overcome challenges inherited from several legacy issues, in particular the failed investment in the Azurite field which resulted in material losses for the company and has led to the company's recent financial

<<<

 difficulties. During 2013 and 2014, the company with its new management has taken several measures to reduce financing and execution risk while progressing the company's asset portfolio, including:
1

NORDIC TRUSTEE
· Raising SEK 815 million

<<<

 in new equity capital during 2013
· Maturing o f development plans on key assets
· Completion of farm-outs in the company's assets in Denmark and the Republic of Congo and the farm-out agreement in the offshore Tunisian assets pending approvals

<<<


· Commissioned a third party review of Reserves and Contingent Resources by independent consultant firm ERC Equipoise ("ERCE")
As previously communicated, and in accordance with the plans presented in connection with the equity and bond financings

<<<

 in 2013, PA Resources is working to establish a financing plan for 2015 and onwards that addresses the funding of the material investments required to realise the value of its asset portfolio. It is the Issuer's view that a significant amount

<<<

 of new equity is required in order to fund the planned operations through 2015 and beyond, and the board o f directors of the Issuer expects that PA Resources' debt position will need to be addressed through the execution of the financing plan

<<<

.
The scope of the financing plan is dependent on the outcome of ongoing government approval processes in Tunisia, concerning the company's farm-down transaction to EnQuest pic and a license extension on the company's Zarat license, which includes

<<<

 the Zarat and Elyssa fields. Due to the materiality of the assets related to these approvals, the Issuer's view is that it is not able to raise new equity capital until further clarity is achieved in Tunisia. In the meantime, the company is

<<<

 examining ways of preserving liquidity and has taken actions in order to do so without disrupting ongoing business or future value of asset developments.
In late September and early October 2014, the Issuer has scheduled interest payments on

<<<

 its (i) Working Capital Facility ("WCF"), (ii) Reserve Based Lending ("RBL") facility, (iii) NOK bonds and (iv) SEK bonds (together the "Debt Facilities" and each a "Debt Facility") amounting to a total of USD 22 million, whereof USD 21 million

<<<

 relates to interest payments on the company's bonds (split USD 7 million and USD 14 million for the NOK and SEK bond issues respectively). Given its current liquidity position, the Issuer will not be able to settle these interest payments in

<<<

 cash and hence proposes to defer all interest payments on all its Debt Facilities.
The Issuer has reached an agreement with its largest creditor and shareholder, the Gunvor Group, for the upcoming interest payments under the WCF and RBL facilities

<<<

. Under this agreement, Gunvor accepts that all unpaid interest (in total USD 1 million) together with future interest payments will be rolled up to and including 5 February 2015 (with the same right to bring this deferred interest payment date

<<<

 forward as the Bondholders have pursuant to items 3(a)(ix) and (x) in the Proposal below). The agreement is however conditional upon the acceptance by the bondholders in each of the NOK and SEK bond issues o f the proposed amendments which

<<<

 have been summoned for.
The Issuer is currently in discussions with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders in the NOK and SEK bond issues holding in excess of one-third of the NOK bonds and one-half of the SEK bonds, who have indicated

<<<

 that their support for the proposals in this summons will be conditional
2

NORDIC TRUSTEE

upon there being in place arrangements which are satisfactory to them for the retention of legal and financial advisers to represent Bondholders' interests

<<<

 going forward.
It is the view of the Issuer's management and board o f directors that a timely execution of the proposal is in the best interest o f all PA Resources' stakeholders. Approval of the proposed amendments will give the Issuer necessary

<<<

 time to prepare and execute a long-term financing plan following clarification of government approval processes in Tunisia, securing transparency on the future of PA Resources' key assets and developments.

For further details and Issuer update

<<<

, reference is made to (i) stock exchange notices and press releases issued on the Issuer's website (www.paresources.se), (ii) the presentation published on the Issuer's website in connection with the first summons dated 18 September 2014, and

<<<

 (iii) the Issuer's unaudited Q2 2014 report published on 18 July 2014. The Bondholders are encouraged to review such information and, if necessary, consult with the Issuer for any further details.

<<<

 e-mail to the address indicated below no later than 5.00 p.m. (CET), Monday 20 October 2014. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded. B. Decision procedure The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate under

<<<

 the Written Procedure as valid votes. When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent, the Proposal shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies in the Written

<<<

 Procedure has not yet expired. Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure will: i) be sent by notice to the Holders, ii) be published as a press release, and iii) be published on the websites of a) the Issuer and b) the

<<<

 Agent. The minutes from the Written Procedure shall at the request of a Holder be sent to it by the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable. A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Holders, irrespective of them responding

<<<

 in the Written Procedure. C. Voting rights and authorisation Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (10 October 2014) in the debt register:
(i) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities

<<<

 Account; or (ii) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several
Bonds. Bonds registered with a nominee If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered

<<<

 authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as

<<<

 instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a power of attorney/authorisation, Schedule 2, from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorization. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries

<<<

, you need to obtain authorization directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as holder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered

<<<

 in
9

NORDIC TRUSTEE
the debt register as a holder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner. Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised

<<<

 nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one). The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for

<<<

 assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorization or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not

<<<

 entitle to any voting rights. D. Quorum To approve the Proposal, Holders representing at least 20 per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum. If a quorum does not

<<<

 exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure. E. Majority Three quarters (3/4) of the

<<<

 Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Holders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to the Proposal. If the Proposal is not adopted, or if the bondholders under the NOK Bond Agreement do not adopt the Proposal in Schedule 3, the Terms

<<<

 and Conditions will remain unchanged. F. Address for sending replies Return the Voting Form, Schedule 1, and, if applicable, the Power of Attorney/Authorisation in Schedule 2 or other sufficient evidence, if the bonds are held in custody other
