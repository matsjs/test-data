To be eligible to participate

<<<

 in the Written Procedure a person must fulfil the formal criteria for being a Bondholder on 16 January 2017 (the "Record Date"). This means that the person must be registered on a Securities Account with Euroclear Sweden AB, being the CSD,

<<<

 as a direct registered owner (Sw. direktregistrerad ägare) or authorised nominee (Sw. förvaltare) with respect to one or several Bonds.
The information in this Notice to a Written Procedure regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided

<<<

 by the Issuer, and the Bonds Agent expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.

1. BACKGROUND

In June 2015, Func Food Sweden AB acquired ACMF Holding AB and two of its subsidiaries (collectively the "Target")

<<<

. The merger between Func Food Sweden AB and ACMF Holding AB has resulted in a number of technical and financial implications for Func Food Sweden AB and for the Group as a whole. Also, post the acquisition of the Target the equity position

<<<

 within the Group's Swedish division is not at an adequate level to support the division's growth targets and business initiatives going forward.

As a result, the Issuer wishes to make certain variations to the provisions of the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 of the Bonds in order for the Group to, among other things, mitigate the technical obstacles related to Func Food Sweden AB's statutory position after the merger with ACMF Holding AB, restore the equity position within the Swedish entity and

<<<

 enhance the liquidity position of the wider Group.

2.

PROPOSAL

In order to achieve the above mentioned objectives, the Issuer proposes certain amendments of the Terms and Conditions which are regulating the Security granted in respect of

<<<

 the Bonds and to make a partial release of the Transaction Security over the Intercompany Loan (as defined below), the prepayment structure of the Bonds and the disbursement of the Pre-Funded Earn-Out Amount, currently in escrow. The proposed

<<<

 amendments include:

i)

A maximum of EUR 10,000,000 of the existing EUR 33,082,000 intercompany loan, being

subject to Transaction Security, made available by the Issuer to Func Food Sweden AB

(the "Intercompany Loan"), shall, at any time

<<<

 prior to the Final Maturity Date of the

Bonds, be converted into unconditional shareholders' contribution and/or be subject to

2

set-off against any unpaid shareholders' contribution made by the Issuer to Func Food Sweden AB.

ii)

Waiver

<<<

 for any scheduled amortisation payments payable in 2017 under the current

amortisation plan of the Bonds and any default occurring due to the partial release of

the Transaction Security granted over the Intercompany Loan.

iii) Early disbursement

<<<

 of the Pre-Funded Earn-Out Amount of SEK 70,000,000, currently in escrow, towards mandatory amortisation of the Bonds.

Provided that the Bondholders vote in favour of approving the proposed amendments of the Terms and Conditions and the partial

<<<

 release of the Transaction Security over the Intercompany Loan, as further described in Section 3 below, the Issuer shall ensure that an additional amount of equity, amounting in aggregate to a minimum of EUR 2,000,000 and a maximum of EUR

<<<

 3,000,000, of which EUR 500,000 was contributed on 20 December 2016, is irrevocably and unconditionally contributed to the Issuer in the form of a convertible subordinated loan.
