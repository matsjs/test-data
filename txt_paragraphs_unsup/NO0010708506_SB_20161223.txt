 Callable Bond Issue 2014/2019

Oslo, 23 December 2016

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO BOND AGREEMENT

Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above

<<<

 mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. (the "Issuer", and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group") is the issuer.

All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond

<<<

 agreement dated 1 April 2014 and made between the Bond Trustee and the Issuer (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein.

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and

<<<

 the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1

BACKGROUND

Reference is made to the Bond Agreement.

The Issuer is actively pursuing several acquisition targets in order to grow. For the Issuer

<<<

 to have the necessary flexibility to act quickly when needed and avoid unnecessary complications for any acquisition process the Issuer proposes to amend the definition of "EBITDA" to adjust for projected synergies in connection with future

<<<

 acquisitions to and including Q2 2018.

The Issuer also proposes to clarify that earn out mechanisms implying deferred settlement of part of the purchase price of any acquisitions based on the performance of the business following the acquisition

<<<

 are not covered by the Financial Indebtedness Restriction set out in the Agreement. The background for the Issuer's proposal to clarify this relates to the fact that, based on the Issuer's experience from negotiations with certain sellers,

<<<

 it is desirable to agree on a purchase price which is divided in (i) upfront payment in cash and (ii) deferred future settlement based on the actual performance of the target during a specified period of time to be paid following completion

<<<

 of the acquisition, for example based on a multiple of the target's EBITDA.

The Group has had significant exceptional items related to the demerger from its previous owner (Det Norske Veritas) and the implemented cost reduction program. Going

<<<

 into 2017, the Group expects further exceptional items related to finalising the implementation of the cost savings program, as well as optimising the operations and planned acquisitions.

NORDIC TRUSTEE
The definition "EBITDA" excludes Exceptional Items. However, the current definition "Exceptional Items" includes a limit of 10 % for items which do not fall within the scope

<<<

 of Known Exceptional Items. The real number in connection with the implementation of the cost savings program will temporarily be significantly higher.
The Issuer hence proposes an amendment to exclude, to and including Q2 2018, the 10 % limit

<<<

 for Exceptional Items, applicable to exceptional items other than Known Exceptional Items, in order to facilitate for the cost savings program and create the necessary buffers to carry on with planned acquisitions in timely fashion. The amendment

<<<

 will enable the Issuer to use its real EBITDA, hence creating necessary buffers to complete cost savings program and continue to grow by acquiring other companies and businesses, to the benefit of all stakeholders.

PROPOSAL

On the background

<<<

 information set out above, the Issuer proposes to make the following changes to the Bond Agreement (Clauses 2.1 to 2.5 below are hereinafter referred to as the "Proposal"):

<<<

2.2 EBITDA A new sub-clause (ii) shall be added to the definition EBITDA reading:

(ii)for any Relevant Period to and including the Relevant Period ending 30 June 2018 only, including any projected cost savings associated

<<<

 with a business or assets acquired during the Relevant Period, such projected cost savings and adjustment not to exceed in aggi-egate ten (10) per cent o f EBITDA for such acquired business for that Relevant Period and to be confirmed in writing

<<<

 by the CFO or CEO o f the Issuer;

The current sub-clauses (ii) and (iii) shall be renumbered as sub-clauses (iii) and (iv).
