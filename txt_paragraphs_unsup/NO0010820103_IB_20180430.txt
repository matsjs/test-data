Board of Directors' report 2017

About Pandion Energy AS Pandion Energy

<<<

 AS ('Pandion Energy" or "The Company") is a private, full-cycle oil and gas company on the Norwegian Continental Shelf ("NCS") driving value by maturing resources to reserves in high quality assets. The company is headquartered in Oslo. The

<<<

 company was founded in November 2016 to perform a management buyout of the operational platform and 6 licenses of Tullow Oil Norge AS, previously Spring Energy Norway AS. The Company is owned by the management team and Kerogen Capital, an independent

<<<

 private equity fund manager specialising in the international energy sector.
Pandion Energy had at year-end 2017 eight licenses on the Norwegian Continental Shelf ("NCS"). In the recently announced APA 2017 Pandion Energy was awarded a further

<<<

 two licenses, bringing the total number of licenses in its portfolio to ten. The portfolio

contained 28.6 mmboe of reserves and 59 mmboe of contingent resources.
Strategic achievements in 2017 During the first year of establishment, Pandion

<<<

 Energy has successfully achieved many of the ambitions and objectives it set out at the outset. The foundation was laid in June 2017, when the Company was pre-qualified as a licensee on the NCS.
The Company set out to create a fullyfledged

<<<

 company on the NCS, with the ambition to operate both in exploration, developments and production. The initial ambition was to develop a portfolio of 100 mmboe of reserves and contingent resources. With the acquisition of a 10% interest in

<<<

 the producing Valhall and Hod fields from Aker BP in December 2017, the Company is close to achieving this earlier than first anticipated.
In December, the Plan for Development

and Operation for the Valhall West Flank project was also submitted

<<<

, adding to Pandion Energy's development portfolio. Pandion Energy's development project in Cara also progressed well in 2017, with the operator Neptune Energy increasing resource estimates in November.
The financial statements Pursuant to the

<<<

 8 3-3a of the Norwegian Accounting Act, the Board of Directors confirms that the conditions for continued operations as a going concern are present and that the annual accounts have been prepared on the basis of this presumption. The Board

<<<

 of Directors confirms that the annual accounts represent a true and fair view of the Company's financial position and is not aware of any factors that would materially affect the assessment of the company as of 31 December 2017
The financial

<<<

 statements of the Company are prepared in accordance

4

Pandion Energy

Board of Directors Report 2017

with simplified IFRS pursuant to the Norwegian Accounting Act §3-9 and regulations regarding simplified application of IFRS issued by

<<<

 the Norwegian Ministry of Finance on 3 November 2014. As 2017 is the first year of operations for Pandion Energy the Company has opted to extend the accounting period from 11 November 2016 to 31 December 2017 As this is the first financial

<<<

 statements of Pandion Energy, there are no comparable figures for earlier periods in the report.
Statements of income Pandion Energy had no operating in come or operating expenses during the accounting period, as the Company had no operating

<<<

 activities. The acquisition of 10% of the Valhall and Hod fields from Aker BP had an effective date as of 1 January 2017, but the revenues during the year are accounted for in the pro et contra settlement at closing of the trans action and

<<<

 not in the income statement.
The Company had exploration expenses of NOK 85.3 million for the period, including expenses for acquisition, processing and analysis of seismic data, as well as allocation of own expensed costs including general

<<<

 and administrative expenses (G&A). Other G&A amounted to NOK 4.5 million.
Net financial income for the period was NOK 14.7 million, mainly related to net foreign exchange gains, partly offset by interest expenses and other financial expenses

<<<

.

Loss before income tax amounted to NOK 75.2 million. The Company reported an income tax credit of NOK 53.9 million, resulting in a net loss after tax of NOK 21.3 million.
Statements of cash flow Net cash flow from operating activities was

<<<

 NOK -40.4 million in the reporting period, primarily driven by an decrease in working capital of NOK 49.6 million and a loss before income tax of NOK 75.2 million.
During the reporting period, Pandion Energy had net cash flow from investing

<<<

 activities of NOK -1 529 million. The main investment activity was the acquisition of 10% interest in the Valhall and Hod fields from Aker BP ASA.
Net cash flow from financing activities was NOK 1 643 million in the period. This figure comprises

<<<

 of proceeds from shareholder loans of NOK 999 million, equity contribution of NOK 595 million and proceeds from borrowings under the Company's revolving exploration loan facility of NOK 48.6 million.
At the end of 2017, cash and cash equivalents

<<<

 amounted to NOK 73.6 million.
Balance sheet statements Total assets at year-end amounted to NOK 3 210 million, of which property, plant and equipment represented NOK 1 066 million and intangible assets represented NOK 1 668 million.

Equity

<<<

 was NOK 574 million at year-end, of which NOK 174 million was issued in connection with the management buyout of Tullow Oil Norge AS and NOK 421 million was issued in connection with the acquisition of 10% interest in the Valhall and Hod fields

<<<

 from Aker BP ASA.
Total interest-bearing debt at the end of 2017 was NOK 1 032 million, including liabilities to related parties in the form of shareholder loans.
Events after the period In January, Pandion Energy was awarded two new prospective

<<<

 exploration licenses under the 2017 Norwegian APA (Awards in Pre-defined Areas) License Round on the NCS. Both licenses are located in the Norwegian North Sea. PL 912 is located at the southern margin of the Utsira High. PL 929 is located at

<<<

 the Måløy slope, between the Agat field to the north and the Gjøa field to the south.
Following the acquisition of 10% working interest in the Valhall and Hod fields the Company has commenced a process securing external funding with target

<<<

 of completion early April 2018.
On 27 March 2018 an extraordinary General Meeting in Pandion Energy passed a resolution of share capital increase of NOK 317 million by way of shareholder loan conversion.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy

<<<

 approved the plan for development and operation (PDO) for Valhall Flank

5

Pandion Energy

Board of Directors Report 2017

Vest on 23 March 2018, where Pandion Energy has a 10% interest. The project aim to continue the development of the

<<<

 Tor formation on the western flank of the Valhall field. Net to Pandion capital expenditures are estimated to NOK 550 million over 2018-2020.
Risk factors Pandion Energy is subject to numerous controllable and uncontrollable risks deriving

<<<

 from the nature of the oil and gas business in a business landscape that is dynamic and volatile. The oil and gas industry, and Pandion Energy, has a variety of operational, financial and external risks that may not be fully possible to eliminate

<<<

 even with robust processes and experience.
The Board of Directors ('The Board") work together with the Company to develop a risk management strategy and processes to enable the management to deal effectively with, and proactively prevent, potential

<<<

 events. The Board is also responsible for overseeing the implementation of this strategy, by making sure that the framework for the identification, control and monitoring on all risk areas is up to standard, and that systems and procedures

<<<

 are in place to address these risks.
Operational risks The Board recognises the risks associated with the Company's operational assets. The regulation of activities on the NCS provides a sound framework for handling these risks, and

the Company

<<<

 takes an active approach as a partner.
Future production of oil and gas is dependent on the Company's ability to find, or acquire, and develop reserves.
There is always a risk that a major operational incident could occur as drilling and production

<<<

 activities will never be completely risk free. Further, there are risks related to the integrity of our assets, risks associated with our reported reserves and resources, and risks associated with third party contractors or operators, as the

<<<

 Company's assets are non-operated. Costs of development projects or exploration efforts are also uncertain.
As a result of these risks, the Company may incur costs that have the potential to damage the Company's financial position or its reputation

<<<

 as a player on the NCS. The Company intends to act as a sound, reliable and technically competent partner across the whole spectrum of activities in all its operations and will work actively together with operators to reduce the possibility

<<<

 of risks occurring.
Financial risks The Company is exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations could impact the company in itself but could further influence banks' and investors' appetite

<<<

 to lend to, or invest in, the Company. The

Company has no material exposure to credit risk from its operating activities.
The Company's production is crude oil dominant, and it has put in place hedging efforts to secure the value and liquidity

<<<

 of its production through acquiring put options. A downturn in oil prices could still, however, result in a dampened sentiment amongst market players to invest in exploration and new developments that could adversely impact the growth ambitions

<<<

 of the Company.
Currency risks arise from multi-currency cash flows within the Company. Going forward revenues from sale of crude oil are mainly in USD while expenditures are mainly in NOK and USD. Sales and expenditures in the same currency

<<<

 contribute to mitigating some of the currency risk. Another driver behind this risk results from the mismatch between the currencies required for funding operational expenditures and the denominations of a large part of the Company's funding

<<<

 sources. The Com pany may, from time to time, seek to reduce the currency risk by entering into foreign currency instruments. No such instruments have been used in 2017
The Company's future capital require ments depend on many factors, and

<<<

 the Company may need additional funds to fulfil its commitments and further develop exploration and development programmes to support the strategic direction of the Company.

6

Pandion Energy

Board of Directors Report 2017

As the Company

<<<

 is partly funded through debt with floating interest rates, adverse changes in market interest rates can have a negative effect on the Company's profitability, liquidity and financial position. The Company may, from time to time, seek to reduce

<<<

 its interest-rate risk by entering into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. No such swaps have been used in 2017.
Pandion Energy is highly focused on active risk management through potential hedging, liquidity focus and insurance.
Offshore

<<<

 insurance program The Company has insured its pro rata liability on the NCS on a par with other oil companies and offshore insurance programs are in place covering the following risks (non-exhaustive) · Loss of Production Income · Physical

<<<

 damage to assets · Control of Well · Third party liability
Pandion Energy is actively reducing financial risk through an extensive insurance program, the key element is loss of production income cover for an indemnity period of 18 months with

<<<

 a 45 days waiting period.
External risks The business landscape in which the Company operates can change rapidly. The risks of changes to commodity prices are addressed under financial risks, but the Company also faces

other external risks

<<<

 that could affect its financial position over time.
For instance, there can be no assurance that legislation, including tax regulations, will not be changed in a manner that could adversely affect the Company. There is also a potential exposure

<<<

 from the response to climate change, as changes to regulations on emissions. The Company aims to develop a portfolio of assets that remains resilient as the government s response to climate change evolves.
Health, Safety and Environment Health

<<<

, Safety and Environment ("HSE") is of paramount importance to Pandion Energy. The Company operates in an industry exposed to safety risks and accidents can occur at any time. The consideration of HSE and governance issues is thus of strategic

<<<

 importance and a pre-requisite for our stakeholders. The company has a comprehensive HSE management system and requires competent employees and contractors to deliver compliant operations through rigorous planning and execution.
Pandion Energy

<<<

 has no operated assets in its portfolio, but it closely works to identify, control and monitor risks with the ambition to interact proactively with the operators of its assets. Pandion Energy experienced no major accidents, injuries, incidents

<<<

 or any environmental claims during the reporting period.

Sustainability and Governance The Board works to make sure that the Company acts as a reliable partner on the NCS, by providing effective governance of the business to ensure the greatest

<<<

 possible value creation for the Company's stakeholders and the society, in a safe and reliable manner. The Company is committed to explore for and produce oil and gas in a safe and responsible manner, and the fact that its organisation would

<<<

 never compromise on this is an important pre-requisite for the Company's main financial backer, Kerogen Capital, a signatory to the United Nations backed Principles for Responsible Investment ("UNPRI"). Kerogen Capital aims to be the private

<<<

 equity manager of choice for those seeking to invest in oil and gas sector and spends significant resources ensuring that sustainable and compliant practices are implemented in all companies it invests in.
The Company will act responsibly towards

<<<

 all stakeholders when conducting its operations, be it shareholders and creditors, ensuring a fair and equal treatment, society and local communities, contributing to local and national wealth generation, employees, ensuring a safe and fruitful

<<<

 working environment, and authorities, providing an open and transparent approach built on the principle of collaboration.
Pandion Energy has no plans of expand ing its operations outside of Norway for

7

Pandion Energy

Board of Directors

<<<

 Report 2017

the foreseeable future. Being a pure-play on the NCS, the Company operates in a single governance environment with predictable regulations. Having a non-operated strategy, the Company must also place confidence in the ope rators

<<<

 of its assets, and is pleased to see that operators like Aker BP and Neptune Energy are determined to operate in a responsible manner and reduce the en vironmental footprint of their operations.
The Board believes that good gover nance is rooted

<<<

 in adherence to regulations and laws, both in letter and in spirit. Ensuring a culture of integrity, accountability and transparency, through the continued training and development of all levels of staff, is just as critical as ensuring that

<<<

 compliant procedures are in place. A thorough model of governance, risk management and control has been developed and implemented in the Company. The Company's management system is a key component of the governance model, which incorporates

<<<

 activities at the shareholder and market level, the Board level and the management level.

Pandion Energy is not a listed company and is currently owned by funds managed by Kerogen Capital and the management team. Yet, the Company encourages

<<<

 transparency and aims for a fair and equal treatment of all existing and future shareholders. The Company will seek to provide all existing and future investors with the necessary details to assess the fair value of the Company, and the risks

<<<

 it faces.
Organisation As of 31 December 2017, the Company had 15 employees. Due to increased activity level Pandion Energy is planning for further recruitment in 2018.
The working environment in Pandion Energy is satisfactory. Absence on sick

<<<

 leave was 1.06 percent in 2017 Pandion Energy aims to keep sick leave at low levels by constantly improving working and safety conditions.
The company attempts to maintain a working environment with equal opportunities for all based on qualifi

<<<

 cations and irrespective of gender,

age, sex, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected status.
At year end, 33 percent of the employees were female. Female employees made up 50 percent of the Management team. Currently

<<<

, none of the member of the Board of Directors is female.
Outlook The Board believes that Pandion Energy is well positioned for further growth on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, and will encourage the Company to continue on its path to identify

<<<

 and invest in proven, high quality assets. By being a strong licence partner in proven fields, the Company can take benefit from partnerships with strong operators and contribute to maximise the value of producing reserves.
In addition, the

<<<

 Board will consider growth via exploration, development and asset or company acquisitions that will enhance the value creation for the Company's shareholders and improve the Company's credit profile.

Notes to the accounts

NOTE 1 ORGANISATION
Pandion

<<<

 Energy AS ('Pandion Energy" or "the Company") was founded in November 2016 through a management buyout of the operational platform and 6 licenses of Tullow Oil Norge AS and is incorporated and domiciled in Norway. The address of its registered

<<<

 office is Lilleakerveien 8, 0283 Oslo, Norway. Pandion Energy is a private oil and gas company focusing on exploration, appraisal, development and production opportunities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.
As 2017 is the first year of operations

<<<

, Pandion Energy has opted to extend the accounting period from 11 November 2016 to 31 December 2017 The financial statements of the Company for the period ending 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of

<<<

 the Board of Directors on 28 March 2018.
NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Statement of compliance The financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with simplified IFRS pursuant to the Norwegian Accounting Act §3-9 and

<<<

 regulations regarding simplified application of IFRS issued by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance on 3 November 2014.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with some exceptions, as detailed in

<<<

 the accounting policies set out below. The subtotals and totals in some of the tables may not equal the sum of the amounts shown due to rounding.
Expenses in the statements of income are presented based on their function within the entity.

<<<

 Exploration expenses as presented in the statements of income include a share of salaries and related expenses and other indirect administrative expenses reclassified using allocation keys based on time writing. Significant expenses such as

<<<

 exploration, salaries,

pensions etc. are presented by their nature in the notes to the financial statements.
The statements of cash flow have been prepared in accordance with the indirect method.
Interest in joint operations (arrangements

<<<

 in which Pandion Energy and other participants have joint control and each of the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, rating to their respective share of the arrangement) and similar arrangements (licenses

<<<

) outside the scope of IFRS 11 are recognised on a line-by-line basis, reflecting the Company s share off assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Pandion Energy has not adopted the following standards and interpretations that are not mandatory

<<<

 for the financial year 2017 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 implementation issues are currently not expected to have

<<<

 a material impact on the balance sheet statements, statements of income and statements of cash flows. Effective from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contract wiht customers, the standard addresses revenue recognition ad establishes principles

<<<

 for reporting useful information to users of financal statements. The Company has not had any revenue in 2017 and will have no implementation effect of the standard. Effective from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases, this standard will replace

<<<

 IAS 17 "Leases" and requires assets and liabilities arising from all leases, with some exceptions, to be recognised on the balanse sheet. Pandion Energy is in the process of evaluating the impact of IFRS 16, and has not yet determined the expected

<<<

 impact of the standard on the financial statements. Effective form 1 January 2019.
Functional currency and foreign currency translations Pandion Energy AS' functional currency is Norwegian Krone (NOK). Transactions in foreign currencies are

<<<

 translated to NOK,

16

Pandion Energy

Financial Statements 2017

Notes to the accounts

at the foreign exchange rate at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to NOK

<<<

 at the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statements of income. Non-monetary assets that are measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange

<<<

 rate at the dates of the transactions.
Business combination versus asset acquisition Determining whether an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination requires judgment to be applied on a case by case basis.
The most important

<<<

 consequence of an acquisition being deemed to be asset acquisition rather than a business combination, is that no deferred tax related to excess fair values is recognised, as the initial recognition exemption for deferred tax under IAS 12 applies

<<<

. No goodwill is recognised in an asset purchase transaction.
Upstream activities in the production phase will typically represent a business, whereas those at the exploration stage will typically represent a asset purchase. Projects that lie

<<<

 in the development stage are more difficult to judge and will require consideration of the stage of development and other relevant factors.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method for accounting. The acquired identifiable

<<<

 tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of the acquisition.
Revenue recognition Revenue associated with the sale and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum

<<<

 products and other merchandise are recognised when risk passed to the customer, which is normally when title passes at the point of delivery of the goods, based on the contractual terms of the agreements.

Income taxes Income tax expense/credit

<<<

 consists of current income tax (taxes payable/receivable) and changes in deferred income tax.
Current Incom e Tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered

<<<

 from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or

<<<

 other comprehensive income, is recognised in equity and not in the statements of income.
Oil-exploration companies operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf under the offshore tax regime can claim a 78% cash refund of their exploration costs

<<<

, limited to taxable losses for the year. The refund is paid out in November in the following year. This tax receivable is classified as a current asset.
D eferred Incom e Tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary

<<<

 differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward

<<<

 of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can

<<<

 be utilised.
Companies operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf under the offshore tax regime can claim the tax value of any unused tax losses or other tax credits related to its offshore activities to be paid in cash (including interest

<<<

) from the tax authorities when operations cease. Deferred tax assets that are based on offshore tax losses carried forward are therefore

17

Pandion Energy

Financial Statements 2017

Notes to the accounts

normally recognised in full. The

<<<

 carrying amount of deferred income tax assets related to onshore activities are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part

<<<

 of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets related to onshore activities are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable

<<<

 profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates

<<<

 (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, is recognised in equity and not in the statement of

<<<

 income.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity

<<<

 and the same taxation authority / tax regime. Timing differences are considered.
Oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditures The company uses the 'modified successful efforts' method to account for exploration and evaluation

<<<

 cost. Pre - license costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs and directly attributable administration costs are initially capitalised in cost centres by well, field

<<<

 or exploration area, as appropriate.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures, including expenditures to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties, related to wells that find proved reserves are transferred from Intangible

<<<

 assets to Property, plant and equipment when the plan for development (PDO) is approved

by the Norwegian Authorities or license partners if no government approval is required. All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant

<<<

 and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reflected at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost

<<<

, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of an asset retirement obligation, if any, exploration cost transferred from intangible assets and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs.
Expenditure

<<<

 on major maintenance or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with

<<<

 the item will flow to the company, the expenditure is capitalised. Inspection and overhaul costs, associated with regularly scheduled major maintenance programs planned and carried out at recurring intervals exceeding one year, are capitalised

<<<

 and amortised over the period to the next scheduled inspection and overhaul. All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and changes in useful

<<<

 lives are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition

<<<

 of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) will be included in Other income or Operating expenses, respectively, in the period the item is derecognised.
Leases As of 31

<<<

 December 2017 the Company only has leases classified as operational leases. By operating leases the costs are charged to the relevant operating expense related caption on a straight

 the accounts

line basis over the lease term, unless another basis is more representative of the benefits of the lease to the company.
Intangible assets and goodwill Intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated

<<<

 impairment losses. Intangible assets include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources and goodwill.
Intangible assets relating to expenditures on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural

<<<

 gas resources are not amortised. When the plan for development (PDO) is approved by the Norwegian Authorities or license partners if no government approval is required, its intangible exploration and evaluation assets are reclassified to Property

<<<

, plant and equipment.
Goodwill is initially measured at the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for any controlling interest over the fail value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities

<<<

 assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date. Goodwill acquired is allocated to each cash generating unit, or group of units, expected to benefit from the combination s synergies. Following initial recognition goodwill is measured

<<<

 at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Financial assets Trade and other receivables are carried at the original invoice amount, less a provision for doubtful receivables, which is made when there is objective evidence that the company

<<<

 will be unable to recover the balances in full.
Financial assets are presented as current if these contractually will expire or otherwise are expected to be recovered within 12 months after the balance sheet date, or if these are held for the

<<<

 purpose of being traded. Financial assets and financial liabilities are shown separately in the balance sheet statements, unless Pandion has both a legal right and a demonstrable intention to net settle certain balances payable to and receivable

<<<

 from the

same counterparty, in which case they are shown net in the balance sheet statements.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily

<<<

 convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill The company assesses assets or groups of assets for

<<<

 impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Individual assets are grouped based on lowest levels with separately identifiable and largely in dependent cash inflows

<<<

. Normally, separate cash generating units (CGUs) are individual oil and gas fields or plants. For capitalised exploration expenditures, the CGUs are individual wells.
In assessing whether a write-down of the carrying amount of a potentially

<<<

 impaired asset is required, the asset's carrying amount is compared to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. Fair value less costs of disposal

<<<

 is determined based on comparable recent arm's length market transactions, or based on Pandion's estimate of the price that would be received for the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants. Value in use is determined using

<<<

 a discounted cash flow model. The estimated future cash flows applied are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent management's best estimates of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful

<<<

 life of the assets. Pandion uses an approach of regular updates of assumptions and economic conditions in establishing the long-term forecasts which are reviewed by corporate management and updated at least annually. For assets and CGUs with

<<<

 an expected useful life or timeline for production of expected reserves extending beyond 5 years, the forecasts reflect expected production volumes for

19

Notes to the accounts

oil and natural

<<<

 gas, and the related cash flows include project or asset specific estimates reflecting the relevant period.
Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset

<<<

 may exceed its recoverable amount, and at least once a year. Capitalized costs related to exploration and evaluation assets are temporarily capitalised pending the determination of oil and gas reserves. If reserves are not found, or if discoveries

<<<

 are assessed not to be technically and commercially recoverable, capitalized costs are expensed. These costs are then written off as exploration expenses in the statements of income.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether

<<<

 there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer be relevant or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, previously recongised impairment loss is reversed.
Impairment losses and reversals of impairment

<<<

 losses are presented in the statements of income as Exploration expenses or Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses, on the basis of their nature as either exploration assets (intangible exploration assets) or development and producing

<<<

 assets (property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets), respectively.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value

<<<

 may be impaired. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of units, to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of units, is less than the carrying amount, an impairment

<<<

 loss is recognised. Once recognised, impairments of goodwill are not reversed in future periods.
Financial liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised

at cost and subsequently measured at amortised cost using

<<<

 the effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs as well as discount or premium on settlement.
Financial liabilities are presented as current if the liabilities are due to be settled within

<<<

 12 months after the balance sheet date, or if these are held for the purpose of being traded.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable

<<<

 that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. lf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined

<<<

 by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the

<<<

 provision due to the passage of time is recognised under interest and other financial expenses in Net financial items.
Asset retirement obligations (ARO) Provisions for ARO costs are recognised when the company has an obligation (legal or constructive

<<<

) to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of property, plant and equipment and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. The amount recognised is the present value of the

<<<

 estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. Cost is estimated based on current regulation and technology, considering relevant risks and uncertainties. The discount rate used in the calculation

<<<

 of the ARO is determined using an estimated risk-free interest rate, adjusted for risk specific to the liability. Normally an obligation arises for a new facility, such as an oil and natural gas production or transportation facility, upon construction

<<<

 or installation. An obligation may also crystallise during the period of operation of a facility through a change in legislation or through a decision to

20

Pandion Energy

Financial Statements 2017

Notes to the accounts

terminate operations

<<<

, or be based on commitments associated with the company's ongoing use of pipeline transport systems where removal obligations rest with the volume shippers. The provisions are classified under Provisions in the balance sheet statements.
When

<<<

 a provision for ARO cost is recognised, a corresponding amount is recognised to increase the related property, plant and equipment and is subsequently depreciated as part of the costs of the facility or item of property, plant and equipment

<<<

. Any change in the present value of the estimated expendi tures is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding property, plant and equipment. When a decrease in the ARO provision related to a producing asset exceeds the

<<<

 carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised as a reduction of Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses in the statements of income. When an asset has reached the end of its useful life, all subsequent changes to the ARO

<<<

 provision are recognised as they occur in operating expenses in the statements of income.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The matters described below are considered to be the most important in understanding the key sources of estimation

<<<

 uncertainty that are involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainty that could most significantly impact the amounts reported on the result of operations, financial position and cash flows.
Proven and probable oil and gas

<<<

 reserves Proven and probable oil and gas reserves have been estimated on the basis of industry standards. The estimates are based on internal information and information received from the operators. Proven and probable oil and gas reserves

<<<

 consist of the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and condensates shown by geological and technical data to be recoverable with reasonable certainty from known reservoirs under existing economic and operational conditions, i.e.

<<<

 on the date that the estimates are prepared. Current market prices are used in the estimates.

Proven and probable reserves and production volumes are used to calculate the depreciation of oil and gas fields by applying the unit-of production

<<<

 methodology. Reserve estimates are also used as basis for allocation of purchases price in business acquisitions involving oil and gas licenses and impairment testing of licence-related assets. Changes in petroleum prices and cost estimates

<<<

 may change reserve estimates and accordingly economic cut-off, which may impact the timing of assumed decommissioning and removal activities. Changes to reserve estimates can also be caused by updated production and reservoir information. Future

<<<

 changes to proven and probable oil and gas reserves can have a material effect on depreciation, life of field, impairment of licence-related assets, and operating results.
Carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets Where

<<<

 a project is sufficiently advanced, the recoverability of intangible exploration assets is assessed by comparing the carrying value to internal and operator estimates of the net present value of projects. Intangible exploration assets are inherently

<<<

 judgemental to value. The amounts for intangible exploration and evaluation assets represent active exploration projects. These amounts will be written off to the income statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established

<<<

 or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently

<<<

 uncertain.
G o o d w ill The Company tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions

<<<

. Where the recoverable amount of CGU, or group of units, is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss i recognised.

21

Pandion Energy

Financial Statements 2017

Notes to the accounts

Asset retirem ent obligations The Company has

<<<

 obligations to decommission and remove offshore installations at the end of the production period. The costs of these decommissioning and removal activities require revisions due to changes in current regulations and technology while considering

<<<

 relevant risks and uncertainties. Most of the removal activities are many years into the future, and the removal technology and costs are constantly changing. The estimates include assumptions of the time required and the day rates for rigs

<<<

, marine operations and heavy lift vessels that can vary considerably depending on the assumed removal complexity. As a result, the initial recognition of the liability and the capitalised cost associated with decommissioning and removal obligations

<<<

, and the subsequent adjustment of these balance sheet items, involve the application of significant judgement.
Tax The Company may incur significant amounts of income tax payable or receivable, and recognizes significant changes to deferred

<<<

 tax or deferred tax assets. These figures are based on management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and on relevant court decisions. The amounts of taxes could change significantly as a result of new interpretations of the

<<<

 relevant tax laws and regulations or changes to such laws and regulations.
NOTE 3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
General information relevant to financial risks Pandion Energy s activities expose the company to market risk (including commodity price

<<<

 risk, currency risk and interest rate risk) liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company s approach to risk management includes assessing and managing risk with focus on achieving the highest risk adjusted returns for the shareholders.
Commodity

<<<

 price risk Pandion Energy will, going forward operate in the crude oil and natural gas market and will be exposed to fluctuations in

hydrocarbon prices that can affect revenues. Commodity price risks will represent the Company s most important

<<<

 market risk going forward. To manage this risk, Pandion Energy will secure cash flows from sale of crude oil through commodity price hedging. In January 2018 the Company has purchased put options for 2018 and first half year 2019.
Currency

<<<

 risk Currency risk arise form multi-currency cash flows within the Company. Going forward revenues from sale of crude oil are mainly in USD while expenditures are mainly in NOK and USD. Sales and expenditures in the same currency contribute

<<<

 to mitigating some of the currency risk. The Company may, from time to time, seek to reduce the currency risk by entering into foreign currency instruments. No such instruments have been used in 2017.
Interest-rate risk The Company s interest

<<<

 rate risk arises from its interest bearing borrowings. See note 15 for information about the floating interest rate conditions on the Revolving Exploration Loan Facility. Borrowings issued with floating interest rate conditions expose the Company

<<<

 to cash flow interest rate risk. The Company may, from time to time, seek to reduce its interestrate risk by entering into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. No such swaps have been used in 2017
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk

<<<

 that the Company will not be able to meet obligations of financial liabilities when they become due. The purpose of liquidity management is to make certain that the Company has sufficient funds available at all times to cover its financial

<<<

 liabilities. To identify current and future financing needs, Pandion Energy carries out short-term (12 months) and long-term (five years) forecasts to plan the Company s liquidity. These forecasts are updated regularly, for various scenarios

<<<

 and from part of the decision basis for the Company s management and Board of Directors. The Company has commenced a process securing further external debt financing estimated to finalise early April 2018.

 2017

Notes to the accounts

Credit risk The Company has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Company is mainly exposed to credit risk related to trade receivable and overcall joint venture toward license partners in addition to

<<<

 cash and cash equivalents. The Company s license partners are credit worthy oil companies and cash and cash equivalents are receivable from banks.
Measurement of financial instruments Pandion Energy AS financial instruments mainly consists

<<<

 of trade and other payables and receivables that are measured at fair value or their carrying amounts reasonably approximate fair value except non-current financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
NOTE 4 BUSINESS COMBINATION
On 22 December

<<<

 2017, Pandion Energy AS finalized the acquisition of 10 per cent interest in the Valhall and Hod oil fields. The transaction was announced on 4 December 2017. Pandion Energy AS paid a cash consideration of USD 170 million (NOK 1 422 million

<<<

) in additon to settlement of effective periode adjustments of USD 1 million (NOK 8 million).
The closing of the transaction took place on 22 December 2017. For accounting purposes the transaction date is set to 31 December 2017. For tax purposes

<<<

, the effective date was 1 January 2017. The acquisition is regarded as a business combination and has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3. A purchase price allocation (PPA) has been performed

<<<

 to allocate the consideration to fair value of assets and liabilities. The valuation is based on currently available information about fair values as of the acquisition date. If new information becomes available within 12 months from the acquisition

<<<

 date, the Company may change the fair value assessment in the PPA, in accordance with guidance in IFRS 3.
Each identifiable asset and liability is measured at its acquisition date fair value based on guidance in IFRS 3. The standard defines

<<<



fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This definition emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement

<<<

, not an entity-specific measurement. When measuring fair value, the Company uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability under current market conditions, including assumptions about risk. Acquired

<<<

 property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (value of licenses) have been valued using the income approach.

The recognized amounts of assets and liabilities assumed as at the date of the acquisition were as follows

The goodwill of NOK 1 024 million arises principally because of the requirement to recognize deferred

<<<

 tax assets and liabilities for the difference between the assigned fair values and the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Licenses on the NCS can only be sold in a market after tax, based on a decision

<<<

 made by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance pursuant to the Petroleum Taxation Act Section 10.

23

Pandion Energy

Financial Statements 2017

Notes to the accounts

The assessment of fair value of such licenses is therefore based on cash flows

<<<

 after tax. Nevertheless, in accordance with IAS 12 Sections 15 and 19, a provision is made for deferred tax corresponding to the tax rate multiplied with the difference between the acquisition cost and the tax base. The offsetting entry to

<<<

 this deferred tax is goodwill. Hence, goodwill arises as a technical effect of deferred tax (technical goodwill). If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 2017, year to date revenue would have increased by NOK 547 million while

<<<

 EBITDA have increased by NOK 352 million.
