Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Oslo, 3 March 2017

1. PARTIES
Nordic Trustee ASA (formerly Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee")) acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the

<<<

 above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue" or the "Bonds") in respect of which Iona Energy Company (UK) Limited (in administration) (formerly Iona Energy Company (UK) Pic) (the "Issuer") is the issuer and Iona Energy Inc. (the "Parent") and

<<<

 Iona UK Huntington Limited (in administration) (the "Huntington Subsidiary") are the guarantors.
All capitalised terms used in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally dated 26 September

<<<

 2013 (as amended on 3 June 2014 and as amended and restated on 17 April 2015) and made between the Issuer, the Parent, the Huntington Subsidiary and the Bond Trustee (the "Bond Agreement"), the summons dated 9 June 2016 (the "June Summons"

<<<

) to the Bondholders' Meeting held on 16 June 2016 (the "June Bondholders' Meeting"), or the summons dated 15 December 2016 (the "December Summons") to the Bondholders' Meeting held on 22 December 2016 (the "December 2016 Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

") unless otherwise stated herein.
The information in this Summons regarding the Issuer is provided by the Joint Administrators, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
2. BACKGROUND
2.

<<<

1 Offer for the shares in the Issuer by Decipher Energy Limited
We refer to (i) the December Summons pursuant to which Bondholders were informed of the Alternative Transaction being pursued by the Joint Administrators with an interested party

<<<

, and (ii) the "Joint Administrators' Report for Period 6 July 2016 to 5 December 2016" dated 8 December 2016, which was uploaded on www.stamdata.com together with the December Summons.
The Joint Administrators and the Bond Trustee entered into

<<<

 a conditional sale and purchase agreement on 21 February 2017 with Decipher Energy Limited ("Decipher") for the entire issued share capital in the Issuer (the "Issuer Shares") in exchange for nominal consideration (the "Decipher SPA", and the

<<<

 transaction under the Decipher SPA, the "Decipher Transaction"). Under the Decipher SPA, Decipher has agreed to procure that the Issuer shall (and to the extent necessary, put the Issuer in funds at the relevant time in order that it may):

<<<



P0 Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo. Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

· pay an amount equal to US$2,000,000 on completion under the Decipher SPA to allow distributions to the Issuer's unsecured creditors pursuant to the company voluntary

<<<

 arrangement in respect of the Issuer (as more particularly described in paragraph 2.2 below);
· out of an amount equal to US$2,000,000, repay US$1,504,970 of the Outstanding Bonds on completion under the Decipher SPA, and pay amounts due to

<<<

 participants (including the associated employment taxes) under a management incentive plan in an amount equal to US$495,030 (as more particularly described in paragraphs 2.2 and 2.8 below); and
· repay the remaining US$3,500,000 of Outstanding

<<<

 Bonds at a date following completion under the Decipher SPA, such payment being conditional upon an extension of the Orlando Licence to a date no earlier than 30 June 2018 (as more particularly described at paragraphs 2.2 and 2.4 below).
Decipher

<<<

 is an independent oil and gas company which was established in 2016. It has binding commitments for the funding of the Decipher Transaction.
It is the view of the Joint Administrators that the Decipher Transaction represents the best option

<<<

 available in the circumstances to maximise recoveries to Bondholders and other stakeholders, taking into account both value and execution risk. Accordingly, the Issuer is seeking the consent of the Bondholders to the Proposals (as defined below

<<<

) in order to implement the sale of the Issuer Shares to Decipher in accordance with the steps set out in paragraph 2.4 below.
2.2 Summary of the Decipher Transaction
The key economic terms of the Decipher Transaction, which are reflected in

<<<

 the Decipher SPA, are as follows:
(a) Decipher has agreed to acquire the Issuer Shares in exchange for consideration of US$1;
(b) Decipher will procure that the Issuer will make the following payments:
(i) US$2,000,000 (the "CVA Funding Amount

<<<

") will be used to establish a fund (the "CVA Fund") for the benefit of certain of the unsecured creditors of the Issuer in order to pay them a dividend in the company voluntary arrangement of the Issuer, which was approved by the Issuer's creditors

<<<

 on 17 June 2016 (the "CVA"). None of the Parent, the Huntington Subsidiary (both of which are also unsecured creditors of the Issuer by virtue of outstanding intercompany loans), the Bond Trustee, the Bondholders or Britannic Trading Limited

<<<

 ("BTL") will be entitled to receive a dividend from the CVA Fund. Please refer to Step 4 in paragraph 2.4 of the June Summons for fuither details of the CVA;
(ii) US$1,504,970 (the "Partial Bond Repayment Amount") will be paid by the Issuer

<<<

 to the Bond Trustee from an amount equal to US$2,000,000 lent by Decipher to the Issuer (the "Completion Amount") to be applied as a partial repayment of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Outstanding Bonds; and
(iii) the

<<<

 balance of US$495,030 (being the Completion Amount less the Partial Bond Repayment Amount, the "Completion M1P Amount") will be used to make payments under the Payment Plan (as defined in paragraph 2.8 below) and the associated employment taxes

<<<

 (as more particularly described at paragraph 2.8 below); and
(c) Following Completion (as defined in paragraph 2.4 below), if one of the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions (as defined in paragraph 2.4 below) is satisfied on or before the date

<<<



2 -

-

that is the later of (i) the date a licence in respect of the Orlando Field is awarded to a party that is not an affiliate of Decipher; or (ii) the date of the announcement of the completion of an OGA licensing round in which the

<<<

 Orlando Field is offered but no licence is awarded to a party (the "Long Stop Date"), Decipher will also procure that the Issuer will pay US$3,500,000 (the "Deferred Bond Repayment Amount") to the Bond Trustee as a further repayment of the

<<<

 aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Outstanding Bonds, following which the Outstanding Bonds will be cancelled. Should the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions not be met by the Long Stop Date, the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount

<<<

 will not be payable and the Outstanding Bonds will be released in full and cancelled. It is proposed that 15 per cent, of the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount received by the Bond Trustee will be applied to make a payment under the Payment Plan

<<<

 (as defined in paragraph 2.8 below) by the Bond Trustee, with the balance available for distribution to Bondholders (as more particularly described at paragraph 2.8 below).
In connection with a funding agreement which was entered into between

<<<

 Decipher and the lenders thereunder prior to the execution of the SPA, the lenders agreed to make funds available to the Issuer on or prior to Completion, which will enable the Issuer to make the payments referred to in paragraphs (i), (ii

<<<

) and (iii) above at Completion.
2.3 Steps which have already been implemented
A number of steps have already been implemented in connection with the failed Bridge transaction (as more particularly described in the June Summons, the "Bridge

<<<

 Transaction"). A summary of these is set out below:
(a) on 27 May 2016, the Bond Trustee enforced its share pledge over the Issuer Shares and is consequently entitled to exercise all voting rights in respect of the Issuer Shares in such a manner

<<<

 as it, in its discretion, thinks appropriate;
(b) on 27 May 2016, the Issuer was re-registered as a private limited company and its name changed to "Iona Energy Company (UK) Limited";
(c) on 27 May 2016, the Huntington Shares were transferred

<<<

 by the Issuer to Iona Developments so that, as at the date of this Summons, Iona Developments is the sole shareholder of the Huntington Subsidiary and Decipher will not be indirectly acquiring the Huntington Subsidiary when it acquires the

<<<

 Issuer Shares;
(d) on 27 May 2016, the Joint Administrators assigned the rights to the Recovery Actions to the Huntington Subsidiary to enable the Joint Administrators (in their capacity as administrators to the Huntington Subsidiary) to properly

<<<

 investigate and pursue (if appropriate) those Recovery Actions in due course. The Joint Administrators are now of the view that they are unlikely to be in a position to pursue any such Recovery Actions, and the Huntington Subsidiary has therefore

<<<

 reassigned to the Issuer all such rights to the Recovery Actions;
(e) the CVA was launched on 2 June 2016 and was approved by the requisite majority of the Issuer's voting creditors on 17 June 2016. Following the expiry of the 28-day challenge

<<<

 period under the CYA on 17 July 2016, the CVA became effective. The CVA was modified on 21 February 2017 by the Super-visors to reflect the terms of the Decipher Transaction and provide that payment of the CVA Fund by the Supervisors is contingent

<<<

 on the completion of the Decipher Transaction (rather than the Bridge Transaction). The modified CVA is available at http://www.fticonsulting-emea.com/cip/iona-energy; and
(f) Newco was incorporated as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands

<<<

 on 12 May 2016. As the Newco structure (as more particularly detailed in paragraph 2.6 of the June Summons)
-3 -

will not be needed under the Decipher Transaction, it is proposed that such structure be unwound.
2.4 Overview of the Decipher

<<<

 Transaction steps
The Decipher Transaction will be implemented in a series of steps as described below. Step 1 has already been implemented. Step 2 is to be implemented during the period between the issuance o f this Summons and the date of

<<<

 the Bondholders' Meeting summoned pursuant to this Summons (the "Bondholder Summons Period"). Steps 3 to 8 (inclusive) will be implemented following the date of the Bondholders' Meeting summoned pursuant to this Summons. The exact order and

<<<

 timing of the steps may be subject to change.
Step 1 - West Wick Assignment
As outlined in the June Summons, the Joint Administrators have entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Chevron in respect of the Issuer's 58.73% working interest

<<<

 in West Wick which provides for a conditional payment of approximately US$1.8 million to the Issuer on approval of a field development plan in respect of West Wick. The Issuer and the Bond Trustee entered into an assignment agreement on 28

<<<

 June 2016 pursuant to which on and from, and subject to, completion under the Bridge SPA, Chevron must pay any consideration payable to the Issuer in connection with the West Wick Transaction (the "West Wick Consideration") to the Bond Trustee

<<<

 (the "Original West Wick Assignment"). As the Original West Wick Assignment is contingent on completion under the Bridge SPA, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee entered into a new assignment agreement on 21 February 2017 in respect of the West

<<<

 Wick Consideration which is contingent on completion under the Decipher SPA (the "New West Wick Assignment"). The Bond Trustee will then distribute the proceeds as contemplated in paragraph 2.6 below.
Step 2 - Bank account andfunding mechanics

<<<

; Settlement Agreements entered into
During the Bondholder Summons Period, the Joint Administrators will settle the following costs, fees and expenses using the remaining cash available at the Issuer and, to the extent that there is insufficient

<<<

 cash available at the Issuer, the Huntington Subsidiary: (i) the costs and legal fees of the Joint Administrators; (ii) costs of the administration of the Issuer up to and including Completion, (including but not limited to salaries, the amounts

<<<

 due under the Settlement Agreements (as defined below), and rent); and (iii) the legal fees of the Bond Trustee and the Issuer.
In addition, each of the members of the Issuer's management team will enter into settlement agreements with the

<<<

 Issuer pursuant to which their employment contracts will be terminated (the "Settlement Agreements"). Termination under the Settlement Agreements will become effective on Completion.
Step 3 - Pre-Completion amendments to the Bond Agreement

<<<

; confirmation o f Huntington Guarantee
A s noted in the June Summons, the Huntington Subsidiary will not be released from its obligations as Guarantor following the release in full of the aggregate amount outstanding under the Outstanding Bonds

<<<

 at Step 8 below. This will allow any cash realisations and/or any cash at the Huntington Subsidiary to be paid to the Bond Trustee under the Huntington Guarantee. The Huntington Subsidiary will pay any such cash realisations to the Bond Trustee

<<<

 in a single lump sum payment for distribution to the Bondholders.
At the June Bondholders' Meeting, in connection with the Bridge Transaction, Bondholders:
(a) approved certain amendments to the Bond Agreement to enable the Huntington Subsidiary

<<<

 to remain liable as a Guarantor under the Bond Agreement following the release of the

4 -

-

Outstanding Bonds under the Bridge Transaction (as more particularly detailed in paragraph 2.5 of the June Summons); and
(b) authorised the Bond

<<<

 Trustee to make a make a demand (the "Demand") under the guarantee in clause 13 of the Bond Agreement (as amended and restated pursuant to (a) above) (the "Guarantee").
As the Bridge Transaction was not implemented, none of the steps referred

<<<

 to in paragraphs (a) and (b) above were taken. It is proposed that Bondholders approve the Pre-Completion Amendments (as defined in paragraph 2.5 below) and the amendment and restatement of the Bond Agreement in the form appended to this Summons

<<<

 at Appendix 2 (the "Pre-Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement"), and authorise the Bond Trustee to make the Demand in connection with the Decipher Transaction. As a consequence of the Pre-Completion Amendments, the Huntington Subsidiary

<<<

 will not be liable for any amounts relating to interest of any kind in respect of the Outstanding Bonds, and any payment by the Huntington Subsidiary under the Guarantee (as amended) shall he made in a single lump sum.
In response to the Demand

<<<

, the Huntington Subsidiary will provide a letter (the "Huntington Confirmation") to the Bond Trustee and the Issuer in which it will confirm that:
(a) it will continue to remain liable under the Guarantee as principal debtor in respect of all

<<<

 amounts owed to the Bond Trustee under the Bond Agreement as at the date of the Huntington Confirmation, other than amounts relating to interest of any kind;
(b) it will retain any proceeds that it recovers and pay such proceeds in a single

<<<

 lump sum payment to the Bond Trustee (who will distribute the proceeds as contemplated in paragraph 2.6 below); and
(c) it will have no rights of repayment, indemnity or subrogation whatsoever against the Issuer.
Step 4 --Completion
Completion

<<<

 will occur in accordance with Steps 4A to 6 (inclusive) below ("Completion").
Step 4A - Decipher SPA
The Bond Trustee entered into the Decipher SPA on 21 February 2017. Pursuant to the Decipher SPA, Decipher has agreed to acquire the Issuer

<<<

 Shares in exchange for consideration o f US$1.
Completion under the Decipher SPA is subject to the following conditions precedent:
(a) written confirmation from the Secretary of State that it will not exercise its rights to revoke or terminate

<<<

 either of the Licences in respect of the Orlando Asset or the Kells Asset as a result of a change of control in the Issuer;
(b) the entiy by the Bond Trustee, the Issuer, the Huntington Subsidiary and the Joint Administrators into the Amendment

<<<

 and Restatement Agreement (as defined in paragraph 2.5 below) and the Bond Debt Release (as defined below);
(c) approval of the Proposals (as defined below) outlined in this Summons at the Bondholders' Meeting, and, prior to the satisfaction

<<<

 of the Condition Precedent (as defined below) in (b) above, no further Bondholders' Meeting having resolved on matters inconsistent with the Proposals;
-5 -

(d) in respect of the CVA:
(i) the preparation by the supervisors of the CVA (the

<<<

 "Supervisors") o f a final form list of Unsecured Creditors whose claims under the CVA have been approved following adjudication by the Supervisors (the "Approved Creditors") and their respective CVA Fund allocations; and
(ii) the modification

<<<

 of the CVA by the Supervisors pursuant to their discretion under clause 29.1 of the CVA to provide that payment of the CVA Fund by the Supervisors is contingent on the completion of the Decipher Transaction (rather than the Bridge Transaction

<<<

), and the Supervisors having written to all known creditors of the Issuer to make them aware of such modifications to the CVA and making a copy of the modified CVA available in an online portal; and
(e) the receipt by Decipher's funding provider

<<<

 of certain European Commission or Bundeskartellamt merger control and/or competition clearances,
(together, the "Conditions Precedent").
Step 4B - Completion under the Decipher SPA
Eleven Business Days (as defined in the Decipher SPA, and being

<<<

 business days in England and Scotland) after the satisfaction of the Conditions Precedent, the Bond Trustee will transfer the Issuer Shares to Decipher in accordance with the terms of the Decipher SPA. The Bond Trustee and BTL will release

<<<

 their security over the Issuer Shares.
New directors nominated by Decipher will be appointed to the hoard of the Issuer, and the existing directors and the company secretaiy of the Issuer will resign.
Step 4C - Right-sizing o fBond Debt
The

<<<

 aggregate amount outstanding under the Outstanding Bonds as at the date of this Summons is approximately US$343,047,631, including accrued but unpaid interest and default interest (the "Bond Debt"). Following Step 4B above, the Bond Debt will

<<<

 be released down to a principal amount of US$5,004,970 (the "Remaining Bond Debt"), and a corresponding number of Bonds will be cancelled in the VPS. It is proposed that the Bond Trustee, the Issuer and the Huntington Subsidiary will enter

<<<

 into a deed of release pursuant to which the Bond Debt will he released down to a principal amount of US$5,004,970 (the "Bond Debt Release"). The Bond Debt Release will be entered into following the Bondholders' Meeting and prior to Completion

<<<

, but under the Bond Debt Release, the release of the Bond Debt described above will only become effective at Completion.
The Remaining Bond Debt will comprise an amount of principal equal to the total of (i) the Partial Bond Repayment Amount

<<<

 (which will he repaid at Step 4D below); and (ii) the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount. Pursuant to amendments that will be made to the Bond Agreement at Step 4D, the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount will be payable only if one of the Deferred

<<<

 Bond Repayment Conditions (as defined below) is satisfied on or before the Long Stop Date, and the Remaining Bond Debt will be non-interest bearing.
Step 4D - Payments under Decipher SPA are made; the security over the assets o f the Issuer

<<<

 is released; further amendment o f Bond Agreement; Waivers and Releases
It is proposed that Bondholders approve amendments to the Bond Agreement to ensure that following the above steps, the Remaining Bond Debt will be non-interest bearing

<<<

 and the only obligations remaining on the Issuer under the Bond Agreement are:

6 -

-

(a) the obligation to pay the Partial Bond Repayment Amount to the Bond Trustee at this Step 4D; and
(b) the obligation to pay the Deferred Bond Repayment

<<<

 Amount to the Bond Trustee if one of the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions (as defined below) is satisfied on or before the Long Stop Date (and the relevant limited obligation on the Issuer to promptly inform the Bond Trustee of (i) the satisfaction

<<<

 of the first to occur of one of the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions (as defined below), (ii) the occurrence of the Long Stop Date, and (iii) any material developments which would be reasonably likely to impact the satisfaction of the Deferred

<<<

 Bond Repayment Conditions and/or the repayment of the Bonds). The Bond Agreement will also provide that if neither of the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions (as defined below) is satisfied on or before the Long Stop Date, the Final Outstanding

<<<

 Bond Debt (as defined below) will be released, and the Issuer's obligations under the Bond Agreement will be cancelled, in each case automatically.
This will involve extensive amendments to the Bond Agreement (as amended and restated at Step

<<<

 3) to delete all covenants, obligations and liabilities, except the obligations outlined in paragraph 2.5 below under "Amendments as part of Completion", and to reflect the fact that the Final Outstanding Bond Debt is unsecured. It is proposed

<<<

 that Bondholders approve the Completion Amendments (as defined in paragraph 2.5 below) and the amendment and restatement of the Bond Agreement in the form appended to this Summons at Appendix 3 (the "Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement

<<<

").
An affiliate of Decipher will have already lent an amount of US$4,000,000, equal to the aggregate of the CVA Funding Amount, the Partial Bond Repayment Amount and the Completion MIP Amount, to the Issuer, which amount shall be held to the

<<<

 Issuer's order in the CMS Client Account. Following the amendment and restatement of the Bond Agreement as described above, the Issuer will authorise the release from the CMS Client Account of:
(a) the CVA Funding Amount to an account in the

<<<

 name of the Supervisors;
(b) the Partial Bond Repayment Amount to the client account of Akin Gump LLP (being the legal advisers to the Bond Trustee), who shall then transfer such amount to an account in the name of the Bond Trustee, as a partial

<<<

 repayment of principal under the Outstanding Bonds; and
(c) the Completion MIP Amount to the Huntington Subsidiary as a partial repayment under an intercompany loan between the Issuer as debtor and the Huntington Subsidiary as creditor.
As

<<<

 a result of the payment at (b) above, the Remaining Bond Debt will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the Partial Bond Repayment Amount (and the remainder, being an amount equal to US$3,500,000 following such reduction, shall be referred

<<<

 to as the "Final Outstanding Bond Debt"), and a corresponding number of Bonds will be cancelled in the VPS. It is proposed that the Bond Trustee will be authorised to distribute the Partial Bond Repayment Amount as contemplated in paragraph

<<<

 2.6 below.
The Bond Trustee and BTL will also release their security over the assets of the Issuer. The Bond Trustee, BTL, the Issuer and the Huntington Subsidiary will also enter into a deed of release and termination (the "Deed of Release

<<<

 and Termination") pursuant to which all parties to the Deed of Release and Termination agree to irrevocably and unconditionally (i) release and discharge each other and the Parent from all liabilities and obligations under the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement and the other Finance Documents, except for, amongst other things, the Bond Agreement, the Huntington Confirmation and the Amendment and Restatement Agreement (as defined in paragraph 2.5 below)

7 -

-

(the "Terminating Finance

<<<

 Documents"), and (ii) terminate the Terminating Finance Documents as between the parties to such deed so that, as between those parties, the Terminating Finance Documents will no longer have any further force and effect.
The Issuer also requests

<<<

 that the Bond Trustee, with effect on and from Completion:
(a) releases the Parent from all covenants, undertakings, liabilities, obligations, claims, actions, suits and demands under the Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement;
(b)

<<<

 releases the Huntington Subsidiary from all covenants, undertakings, liabilities, obligations, claims, actions, suits and demands under the Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement save to the extent that those covenants, undertakings

<<<

, liabilities, obligations, claims, actions, suits and demands are in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Guarantee;
(c) waives any default, Event of Default (as defined in the Pre-Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement

<<<

) and/or Mandatory Prepayment Event (as defined in the Pre Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement) which has occurred or may have occurred under the Pre-Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement prior to the amendment and restatement

<<<

 of the Bond Agreement in the form of the Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement,
(together, the "Waivers and Releases").
If Bondholders authorise the Bond Trustee to give the Waivers and Releases, the Waivers and Releases will be documented

<<<

 in the Amendment and Restatement Agreement (as defined in paragraph 2.5 below), which will be entered into following the Bondholders' Meeting (although the Waivers and Releases will take effect only on and from Completion).
Step 5 - Final actions

<<<

 o f the Joint Administrators
The Joint Administrators will take a number of actions prior to ceasing to act as administrators to the Issuer. These include (i) closing the Issuer's administration bank account; and (ii) making all necessary notifications

<<<

.
Step 6 - The administration o f the Issuer terminates
Within four Business Days of the completion o f all of the Steps set out above, the Joint Administrators will enter into the necessary documentation and take all steps required in order

<<<

 for them to cease to act as administrators to the Issuer, and the Issuer will cease to be in administration.
As is conventional at the end of administration procedures, the Joint Administrators are requesting that the Bond Trustee, in its capacity

<<<

 as the Issuer's secured creditor, discharges the Joint Administrators from liability in accordance with paragraph 98(1) of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) immediately upon the termination of the administration of the Issuer

<<<

. Such discharge was previously included in the proposals of the Joint Administrators dated 9 February 2016. At this subsequent stage, for good practice, the Joint Administrators are requesting that the Bond Trustee reconfirms their discharge

<<<

 from liability on the terns detailed above by virtue of Bondholders approving paragraph l(i) of the Proposals (as defined in paragraph 3 below).
Step 7 - Declaration o f a CVA distribution; closing o f the CVA
Within three Business Days of

<<<

 Completion, the Supervisors will declare and pay a dividend from the CVA Fund to each of the Approved Creditors. Within five Business Days of Completion, the

8 -

-

Supervisors will enter into the necessary documentation and take all steps

<<<

 required in order for them to complete and close the CVA.
Step 8 - Payment o fDeferred Bond Repayment Amount
The Deferred Bond Repayment Amount will become payable by the Issuer to the Bond Trustee as a repayment of principal under the Outstanding

<<<

 Bonds within 15 Business Days o f the satisfaction o f the first to occur of one of the following conditions on or before the Long Stop Date:
(a) the entry into effect of the instrument (whether deed, agreement, letter, notice, confirmation

<<<

 or otherwise) issued by the OGA (or with respect to a notice, received by the OGA) extending the second term of the Orlando Licence to a date no earlier than 30 June 2018 or continuing the Orlando Licence into a third term beyond 30 June 2

<<<

018, with such extension or continuation into the third term provided to allow completion of the Orlando FDP; or
(b) the granting to the Issuer or any affiliate o f the Issuer and/or Decipher of a new licence by the OGA in respect of the Orlando

<<<

 Field on such terms and for such duration as have equivalent effect to (a) above,
(together, the "Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions").
If neither of the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions is satisfied on or before the Long Stop Date, the Final

<<<

 Outstanding Bond Debt will be released automatically, and the Bonds comprising the Final Outstanding Bond Debt will be cancelled in the VPS (and the date of such cancellation shall be referred to in this Summons as the "Senior Bond Cancellation

<<<

 Date").
In summary, this means that, following Completion, if the Issuer or its affiliates (i) receives an extension to the Orlando Licence beyond 30 June 2018, or (ii) is issued a new licence that covers the Orlando Field and such licence

<<<

 extends beyond 30 June 2018, Decipher will procure that the Issuer will pay the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount to the Bond Trustee as a repayment of the Final Outstanding Bond Debt, following which the Bonds comprising the Final Outstanding

<<<

 Bond Debt will be cancelled. The Final Outstanding Bond Debt will therefore remain outstanding until the first to occur of (i) the Issuer paying the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount to the Bond Trustee, (ii) a licence covering the Orlando Field

<<<

 being issued to a third party, or (iii) the OGA announcing that it has attempted to re-licence the Orlando Field area and no party has been awarded a licence for that area. In the case of (ii) and (iii), the Bonds comprising the Final Outstanding

<<<

 Bond Debt will be released and cancelled, and the Issuer's obligations under the Bond Agreement will he cancelled, in each case automatically.
It is proposed that the Bond Trustee be authorised to distribute the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount

<<<

 (as reduced by 15 per cent, pursuant to the terms of the Part A Payment Plan Letter, as outlined in paragraph 2.8 below), as contemplated under paragraph 2.7 below. Following the payment by the Issuer of the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount,

<<<

 the Final Outstanding Bond Debt will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount and will be redeemed in full, and a corresponding number of Bonds will be cancelled in the VPS.
As outlined in Step 3 above, notwithstanding

<<<

 the cancellation of the Final Outstanding Bond Debt, the obligations of the Huntington Subsidiary under the Bond Agreement and the Huntington Confirmation will not he released.
A diagram of the position following Completion is set out at Appendix

2.5 Amendments to the Bond Agreement As noted above, the Bond Agreement will need to be amended twice as part of the Decipher Transaction. It is proposed that the Issuer, the Huntington Subsidiary and the Bond Trustee enter into

<<<

 an amendment and restatement agreement (the "Amendment and Restatement Agreement") pursuant to which the respective amendments and restatements (as outlined below) will become effective at the relevant stages of the Decipher Transaction, and

<<<

, in the case of the Pre-Completion Amendments (as defined below), subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent as outlined in the Amendment and Restatement Agreement.
Amendments pre-Completion
As noted at Step 3 above, before Completion

<<<

 can occur, it is necessary for the Bond Agreement to be amended and restated to provide that, with effect from the date of the Bondholders' Meeting:
(a) clauses 9.6 and 9.7 of the Bond Agreement, and the definition of "PIK Interest" and "PIK

<<<

 Bonds", will be deleted in their entirety, so that the Issuer will no longer he required to pay PIK Interest or issue PIK Bonds on the Outstanding Bonds;
(b) Bondholders will not he entitled to bring any claim against the Issuer in respect

<<<

 of any entitlement prior to the date of the Bondholders' Meeting to he issued PIK Bonds under clause 9.6(b) of the Bond Agreement and any entitlement to be issued PIK Bonds is irrevocably waived;
(c) notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Issuer

<<<

 shall continue to pay cash interest on the Outstanding Bonds at the rate of 9.50 per cent, per annum, and (ii) the Issuer shall continue to be liable for the full amount of the Outstanding Bonds and all amounts of accrued and unpaid interest

<<<

 (including default interest) thereon; and
(d) all amounts payable by the Guarantors will be paid in a single lump sum payment within five Business Days of the date on which (in the case of the Huntington Subsidiary) the Joint Administrators

<<<

 and the Bond Trustee agree in writing that no further recoveries are capable of realisation,
(together, the "Pre-Completion Amendments").
The Issuer therefore proposes that the Bondholders' Meeting approves the Pre-Completion Amendments and

<<<

 the amendment and restatement of the Bond Agreement in the form of the Pre Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement appended to this Summons at Appendix 2, to become effective at Step 3.
Amendments as part o f Completion
As noted above

<<<

, the Bond Agreement (as amended and restated at Step 3) will need to be amended and restated extensively as part of Completion to delete all covenants, obligations and liabilities, so that the only obligations existing under the Bond Agreement

<<<

 on the Issuer on and from Completion are:
(a) the obligation on the Issuer to pay the Partial Bond Repayment Amount at Completion;
(b) the obligation on the Issuer to pay the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount if one of the Deferred Bond Repayment

<<<

 Conditions is satisfied on or before the Long Stop Date; and
(c) a limited obligation on the Issuer to promptly inform the Bond Trustee of (i) the satisfaction of the first to occur of one of the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions, (ii) the

<<<

 occurrence of
- 10-

the Long Stop Date, and (iii) any material developments which would be reasonably likely to impact the satisfaction of the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions and/or the repayment of the Bonds.
As noted above, the Bond

<<<

 Agreement will be amended to provide that in the event that the Deferred Bond Repayment Conditions are not met on or before the Long Stop Date, the Final Outstanding Bond Debt will be released automatically. However, the Huntington Subsidiary

<<<

 will remain liable under the Guarantee. The Bond Agreement will also be amended to provide that the Remaining Bond Debt will be non-interest bearing.
The Issuer therefore proposes that the Bondholders' Meeting approves amendments to the Bond

<<<

 Agreement on these terms (the "Completion Amendments") and the amendment and restatement of the Bond Agreement in the form of the Completion Amended and Restated Bond Agreement appended to this Summons at Appendix 3, to become effective at

<<<

 Step 4D.
2.6 New Residual Recoveries On and from Completion, the Bond Trustee will have received, or be entitled to receive, cash amounts in respect of:
(a) payments under the Guarantee (if any);
(b) the West Wick Consideration;
(c) the Partial

<<<

 Bond Repayment Amount; and
(d) the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount.
In addition, the Bond Trustee holds the NT Retention Amount, being an amount equal to US$1,016,662, pursuant to the authority granted to it at the Bondholders' Meeting held

<<<

 on 21 December 2015 (the "December 2015 Bondholders' Meeting") and further details of which can be found in the December Summons.
In this Summons, (i) the amounts referred to in (a) to (d) above and the NT Retention Amount are, together, the

<<<

 "New Residual Recoveries"; and (ii) the amounts referred to in (a) and (b) above and the NT Retention Amount are, together, the "Extraordinary Proceeds".
Any distributions by the Bond Trustee of the Extraordinary Proceeds will be extraordinary

<<<

 distributions and shall constitute neither a repayment of the principal amount of the Bonds, nor a payment in respect of any interest which has accrued in respect of the Bonds, nor a payment of amounts under the Guarantee. Bondholders' entitlement

<<<

 to the Extraordinary Proceeds will be determined on the basis of Bondholders' holdings of Bonds on the Senior Bond Cancellation Date, and will be independent matured and unpaid claims registered in the VPS which can be traded amongst holders

<<<

.
2.7 Costs of the Decipher Transaction and payment of New Residual Recoveries At the June Bondholders' Meeting, Bondholders resolved that: (i) the reasonably incurred fees, costs and expenses of the legal advisers to the Bond Trustee, the Joint

<<<

 Administrators, the Supervisors and the Companies in connection with the Bridge Transaction (the "Bridge Transaction Costs") would be met out of the remaining cash available at the Issuer and, to the extent that there is insufficient cash available

<<<

 at the Issuer, the Huntington Subsidiary, subject to the Bond Trustee's approval of such transaction costs; and (ii) to the extent that there is insufficient cash available at the Companies to meet the Bridge Transaction Costs, the Bond Trustee

<<<

 was authorised to pay the balance of any
-11 -
1

outstanding Bridge Transaction Costs using the Residual Recoveries (as defined in the June Summons) in its absolute discretion.
Similarly with the Decipher Transaction, the Issuer proposes

<<<

 that the remaining cash available at the Companies will he used to meet reasonably incurred fees, costs and expenses of the legal advisers to the Bond Trustee, the Joint Administrators, the Supervisors and the Companies in connection with the

<<<

 Decipher Transaction (the "Decipher Transaction Costs"). Prior to Completion under the Decipher SPA, Decipher Transaction Costs and other professional costs in an amount estimated to be approximately £860,000 will be settled out of the remaining

<<<

 cash available at the Companies. The Joint Administrators' current expectation is that there will he sufficient remaining cash available at the Companies to meet the Decipher Transaction Costs. However, to the extent that there is insufficient

<<<

 cash available at the Companies to meet the Decipher Transaction Costs, pursuant to the authorisations granted at the June Bondholders' Meeting and as detailed in the December Summons, the Bond Trustee has retained the NT Retention Amount 

<<<

(which, for the avoidance of doubt, forms part of the New Residual Recoveries), to apply towards any Decipher Transaction Costs and to pay any costs and expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee in its capacity as Bond Trustee and Security Agent

<<<

.
In addition, costs will be incurred following Completion, including but not limited to (i) the costs of maintaining the listing of the Bonds on the Oslo Bors; and (ii) any costs and expenses of the Bond Trustee in its capacity as Bond Trustee

<<<

 (the "Post-Completion Costs"). It is proposed that the Post Completion Costs will not be for the account of the Issuer, but are instead paid out of the NT Retention Amount. To the extent that the Post-Completion Costs cannot be met from the

<<<

 NT Retention Amount as they exceed such amount, it is proposed that the Bond Trustee will be authorised to use the other New Residual Recoveries to meet any such Post-Completion Costs, and that the amount that will be held back by the Bond

<<<

 Trustee from the New Residual Recoveries to meet any such Post-Completion Costs shall be at the Bond Trustee's discretion.
The costs of unwinding the Newco structure which was put into place for the Bridge Transaction are estimated to he approximately

<<<

 US$6,600. It is proposed that these will be paid out of the NT Retention Amount.
Following the payment of the amounts above, the Bond Trustee will distribute (i) the balance of the NT Retention Amount; and (ii) the balance of the New Residual

<<<

 Recoveries, to the Bondholders pro rata to their holdings of Bonds (or, if any distributions of Extraordinary Proceeds are made following the Senior Bond Cancellation Date, pro rata to Bondholders' holdings of claims to the Extraordinary Proceeds

<<<

) at the time of such distribution, which shall be on one or more such dates as the Bond Trustee in its discretion (acting reasonably) considers appropriate.
2.8 Managers' Payment Plan As detailed in the June Summons, the Joint Administrators

<<<

 had entered into an arrangement (the "Payment Plan") with six members of the management team of the Issuer (the "Managers") on the terms detailed in the June Summons, as a means of incentivising the Managers to assist with the M&A Process,

<<<

 to negotiate and help deliver a transaction, and to assist the Joint Administrators in managing the Issuer during the administration.
In connection with the implementation of the Decipher Transaction, it is proposed that the Payment Plan be

<<<

 replaced with new agreements on the same commercial terms but amended to reflect the Decipher Transaction.
The proceeds which are subject to the Payment Plan and which are payable on or after Completion will be paid as follows:
- 12-

(a)

<<<

 the Joint Administrators will pay the Completion MIP Amount out of the unrestricted cash in the Issuer on Completion; and
(b) the Bond Trustee will pay amounts due under the Payment Plan which relate to proceeds in respect of (i) the West Wick

<<<

 Consideration, and (ii) the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount (together, the "NT Payment Plan Payments") if and when (and to the extent that) the Bond Trustee receives such proceeds under the terms of the New West Wick Assignment and the Decipher

<<<

 SPA respectively.
It is therefore proposed that the Bond Trustee is authorised to enter into a payment plan letter (the "Part A Payment Plan Letter") in order to govern the terms of the NT Payment Plan Payments. It is further proposed that

<<<

 the Bond Trustee be authorised to:
(a) deduct from the West Wick Consideration such amount as is required to pay the amount that is payable under the Part A Payment Plan Letter in respect of the West Wick Consideration to each of the Managers

<<<

, being a total amount equal to 5 per cent, of the West Wick Consideration, as soon as practicable following, and only to the extent of, the Bond Trustee's receipt of the West Wick Consideration from Chevron; and
(b) deduct from the Deferred

<<<

 Bond Repayment Amount such amount as is required to pay the amount that is payable under the Part A Payment Plan Letter in respect of the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount, being a total amount equal to 15 per cent, of the Deferred Bond Repayment

<<<

 Amount, as soon as practicable following, and only to the extent of, the Bond Trustee's receipt of the Deferred Bond Repayment Amount from the Issuer,
(together, the "NT Payment Plan Deductions").
