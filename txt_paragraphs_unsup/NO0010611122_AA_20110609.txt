 redemption price under clause 9.2.1 o f the CTA should be an amount equal to the aggregate of the principal amount outstanding on the Outstanding Bonds to be redeemed and the Make-Whole Amount.
The term "Make-Whole Amount" means an amount equal

 to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the

<<<

 purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings:
"Called Principal" means, with respect to any Outstanding Bonds to be redeemed, the aggregated principal of such Bonds that is to be prepaid pursuant

<<<

 to clause 9.2.1 of the CTA.
"Discounted Value" means, with respect to the Called Principal, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates

<<<

 to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Bonds is payable) equal to the Reinvestment

 Yield with respect to such Called Principal.
"Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called Principal, 0.50% (50 basis points) over the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yield(s) reported as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on

the most recently issued actively

<<<

 traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury Securities ("Reported") having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there are no such U.S. Treasury Securities Reported having a maturity equal

<<<

 to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between

<<<

 the yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury Securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining

<<<

 Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Bonds.
If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including

<<<

 by way of interpolation), then "Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called Principal, 0.50% (50 basis points) over the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which

<<<

 such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury

 constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield

 to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported

<<<

 with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Bonds.
