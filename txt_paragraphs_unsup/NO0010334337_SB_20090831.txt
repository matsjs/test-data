 TILLITSMANN ASA
www. trustee.no elaborated in the Borrower's report for the 2nd quarter, the Borrower is further in the process of finalising its long term financial plan, which will be presented to its lenders in the coming weeks. The objective

<<<

 of the financial plan is to create a financially robust platform for the Company, which, when coupled with the Company's modern fleet and strong market position should form a solid basis for creating shareholder value and safeguarding its lenders

<<<

. The plan will include a proposal for a new debt repayment schedule as well as a strengthening of the Borrower's balance sheet through an issue of new equity.
In view of the ongoing process with the financial plan and the likely timeline therefore

<<<

, it is the Borrower's opinion that it will be to the advantage of all of its stakeholders, including the Bondholders, if stability can be ensured during this very important period - this both to secure a timely conclusion of the plan as well

<<<

 as to avoid any adverse effects on the Company's business and overall value which likely will be to the detriment of all of the Company's stakeholders.
In order to achieve the above, the Borrower is proposing a temporary, short-term waiver

<<<

 from relevant clauses in the Loan Agreement, including financial covenants, including Clause 15.1(c)(iv) that may cause the Loan to be in default due to the mere fact that the Borrower is negotiating with its lenders, and including Clause 

<<<

15.1 (d)(i) that may cause the Loan to be in default upon default under another loan agreement even if the lenders under this other loan agreement do not declare default or take any action. The Borrower is also in dialogue with the bank lenders

<<<

 regarding these technical default clauses.
Further considering that the issue of the future compliance with the Value Adjusted Equity Ratio covenant can best be discussed within the wider scope of its long term financial plan, which is forthcoming

<<<

 within a reasonably short time, as well as the fact that the Company does not intend to offer, and does not expect that the forthcoming discussions with its lenders will trigger, any fees to be paid to any other of its lenders prior to or outside

<<<

 of the context of the total financial plan, the Borrower is respectfully requesting that the temporary waiver from the Bondholders is given without any compensation in the form of a fee or similar payment.

PROPOSAL

The Company hereby proposes

<<<

 the following to the Bondholders (the "Proposal"):

a)

The Bondholders' meeting temporarily waive Clause 13.2, Clause 15.1(c)(iv)

and Clause 15.l(d)(i) in the Loan Agreement. The waiver shall be effective

until 1 October 2009.
