USD 91.2 million. In addition to this the agreed amount of change orders incurred since

<<<

 the previous payment milestone has to be paid. At present this amount is USD 6.4 mill, and it is not expected to change significantly. Originally planned field specific work of approximately USD 31 million will not be carried out until a firm

<<<

 employment contract for the vessel is in place, and the near term requirements under the bank loan facility will be reduced accordingly.
As previously announced by Nexus, the Company has not yet been able to secure a charter contract for the

<<<

 vessel and is consequently facing dramatic challenges, including taking delivery of the vessel. The bank loan facility has a covenant of satisfactory evidence of sufficient working capital throughout the full tenor of the facility related to

<<<

 the final drawing of the facility. Based on the current cash flow budget, Nexus is short some USD 10-12 million in order to comply with this requirement. Furthermore, substantial costs will accrue in a lay-up situation (interest, management

<<<

, insurances, maintenance, lay-up expenses, etc.) and according to Company estimates these costs amount to USD 75-80 million annually which also need to be funded.
Due to this situation, a majority o f the holders of the USD 175 million Bond

<<<

 have formed a Bondholders Committee (the "Bondholders Committee"). AMA Capital Partners LLC ("AMA") and Bingham McCutchen LLP ("Bingham") as financial and legal adviser respectively, who following this engagement have carried out financial

<<<

 and legal due diligence of the Company, and has carried out discussions with the Lenders in order to seek a long-term solution. This has not yet been reached.
The Board of Nexus is now requesting a solution in respect of the next coupon payment

<<<

 due 7 June 2009 related to the USD 175 million Bond. The Board is very mindful of the working capital position o f the Company and will take appropriate action if a solution to the anticipated cash flow shortfall cannot be found. In order to

<<<

 have some additional time to find an acceptable solution going forward, the Bondholders Committee is willing to defer the interest payment due 7 June 2009 to 24 June 2009 subject to the Lenders not treating Nexus as being in default in this

<<<

 period, the Lenders are to release the required funds to finance the June expense for the Company, and the Lenders agreeing to continue its discussions with the Bondholders Committee. The Lenders in the USD 320 million bank loan facility have

<<<

 in a letter of 8 June 2009 confirmed its support to the requirements from the Bondholders Committee. The bondholders of the USD 75 million Convertible Bond are similarly being asked to defer the date of their next interest payment for 2 weeks

<<<

 to 9 July 2009.
