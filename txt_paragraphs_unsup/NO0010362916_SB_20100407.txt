<<<

 Loans respectively.
1. Background
As holders of Bonds in the Secured Loans are aware of, the Borrower filed for bankruptcy on 5 March 2010 and bankruptcy was opened on 8 March 2010. The Norwegian court appointed Mr. Tom Hugo Ottesen as liquidator

<<<

. The assets of the Borrower and PetroJack IV Pte Ltd are in the process of being liquidated.
Possible transactions have been explored for the sale of the jackup drilling rig known as Petrojack IV (the "Rig") together with the charter contract

<<<

 (the "Drilling Contract") for the Rig entered into with PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited ("PTTEP"). The Rig is currently owned by the Borrower's wholly owned subsidiary Petrojack IV Pte Ltd ("Petrojack IV Pte" or the "Company

<<<

"), and the Rig is mortgaged in favour of bondholders in the three Secured Loans.
The Company has received offers (the "Offer") from third party buyers whom are willing to purchase the Rig, take over the Drilling Contract (if required) and purchase

<<<

 and assume certain other related assets, rights and obligations (jointly referred to as the "Rig Assets"). In consideration for the sale of the Rig Assets, the Company will receive net proceeds after direct expenses connected with the transaction

<<<

 of at least USD 160 million (the "Net Proceeds").

It is the view of the Company and of Pareto Offshore AS (the broker of the Rig) that the consideration reflects the fair market value of the Rig Assets under the prevailing market

<<<

 conditions.
It is proposed that the Net Proceeds are applied towards repayment of the Secured Loans. Although the Net Proceeds from the transaction contemplated by the Offer are insufficient to repay all amounts owning under the Secured Loans

<<<

 (and in particular the 2nd pri Loan and the 3rd pri Loan), Bondholders and the Company have expressed a preference to implement such transaction on a consensual basis that would avoid the alternative option of being effected by enforcement

<<<

 of security, which would have resulted in an insolvent liquidation of the Company.
Based on negotiations between the Company and bondholders under the Secured Loans, the proposal below is presented in order to approve the transaction contemplated

<<<

 by the Offer, corresponding repayments of the Secured Loans, and necessary amendments in the Loan Agreements (hereinafter referred to as the "Proposed Transaction").
2. The Proposed Transaction
By approving the Proposed Transaction, the Bondholders

<<<

 are asked to give their consent to a sale and disposal of the Rig Assets provided that the Net Proceeds are applied in accordance with the priority of the Secured Loans except that, and as referred to above, it is expected that the Net Proceeds

<<<

 will be insufficient to repay all amounts owing under the 2nd pri Loan and the 3rdpri Loan.
Consequently it is proposed that the 3rd pri Loan will get a repayment of principal of 10% of the principal outstanding amount under the 3rd pri Loan

<<<

 (the "Settlement Amount") which currently equals to NOK 20 million. The 3rd pri Loan will keep their entire claim against PetroJack ASA and will keep any further deficiency claim.
It is currently believed that the unsecured assets of PetroJack

<<<

 ASA are around NOK 70 million less cost for running the bankruptcy. A possible scenario for the 3 pri Loan will be an additional recovery of around NOK 1 0 - 2 0 million depending on the dividend percentage which is not possible to calculate

<<<

 exactly at this stage.
The above solution will give a recovery of about NOK 30 - NOK 40 million if the 3rd pri Loan approves the proposal and the remaining part of the contemplated sale is commensurated.
Alternatively, if no consensual sale

<<<

 is possible, Petrjack IV Pte Ltd will either file for liquidation and the bondholders will be forced to initiate an enforcement process, in which case it is believed that the 2nd pri Loan will be substantially exposed, in which case the 3rd

<<<

 pri Loan will not recover any amounts under the rig mortgage.
3. The Proposal to the bondholders in the 3rdpri Loan
It is proposed that the following resolution to be passed by the bondholders in the 3rd pri Loan:
That, conditional upon:
(

<<<

4. Evaluation of the Proposals
