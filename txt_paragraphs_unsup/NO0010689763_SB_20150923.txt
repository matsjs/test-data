2. BACKGROUND AND BONDHOLDERS' ADVISERS
2.1 Background and summary of the Proposal
Following approval by the Bondholders of the Restructuring at the Bondholders' Meeting held 6 August 2015, the Issuer has been focused

<<<

 on satisfying the conditions precedent (as outlined in the July Summons) to facilitate implementation of the Restructuring by 30 September 2015.
Substantial progress has been made on a number of the conditions precedent, including:
· The Service

<<<

 Agreement with Lender A and the Lender A Loan Agreement are in agreed form. · The Service Agreement with Contractor C and the Contractor C Deferred Payment Agreement
are in agreed form. · The Service Agreement with Contractor D and the Contractor

However, it has become clear that further time is required to finalise certain of the documentation. Accordingly, to facilitate completion of the conditions precedent to the Restructuring

<<<

, the Issuer is proposing an extension of the Long Stop Date from 30 September 2015 to 30 November 2015.
In the Bondholders' Meeting held on 6 August 2015, the Bondholders approved, subject to the receipt of the Confirmations, (i) the release

<<<

 of USD 2.5 million from the Escrow Account to the Issuer Earnings Account and (ii) the retention by the Issuer of GBP 1.3 million of proceeds from the Issuer's sale of its 2.5% interest in the Esmond Transportation System (as announced on 

<<<

2 July 2015) (collectively, the "Liquidity Approval"). The Liquidity Approval was requested by the Issuer in order to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its commitments in relation to the development of the Orlando Asset in August

<<<

 and September 2015. The development of the Issuer's liquidity since the July Summons did not necessitate any releases of the aforementioned funds to the Issuer and the Issuer feels comfortable that it will not require the release of such funds

<<<

 until 30 November 2015. Following discussions with the Ad Hoc Committee, the Issuer therefore proposes that the Liquidity Approval granted by the Bondholders' Meeting held 6 August 2015 shall be revoked and cancelled.
