 Shipping ASA Senior Unsecured Callable P IK Bond Issue 2007/2018
Oslo, 26 August 2015
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING - PROPOSED APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT
Nordic Trustee ASA is appointed bond

<<<

 trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN N0001035651.2 (the "Loan" and the "Bonds") where American Shipping Company ASA (the "Borrower" or "AMSC") is the issuer.
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned

<<<

 to them in the loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") entered into on 23 February, 2007 between the Borrower and the Loan Trustee (as later amended and restated), unless otherwise stated in this summons.
The information in this summons regarding

<<<

 the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders meeting to consider

<<<

 a request for consent as set out herein.
1. Background
AMSC is currently in the process of entering into documentation for the refinancing of the facilities under the BNPP Credit Agreement (as defined in the Loan Agreement).
The refinancing

<<<

 will be in an aggregate amount of approx.. USD 500,000,000 and will be secured by, inter alia, mortgages over each of the ten vessels owned by subsidiaries of AMSC. Such subsidiaries will be the borrowers under the refinanced facilities. The

<<<

 liabilities of the borrowers will be guaranteed by AMSC (the "G uarantee").
The financing of the vessels MV "Overseas Tampa" and MV "Overseas Martinez" will be provided by CIT Finance LLC as Lender and Agent (the "CIT Financing") with a loan

<<<

 tenure of 5 years for the "Overseas Martinez" tranche of the CIT Financing and 10 years for the "Overseas Tampa" tranche.
Both tranches will have amortization profiles of 18 years ("18 Year Am ortization").

NORDIC TRUSTEE
Overall the refinancing provides AMSC with increased financial flexibility and represents a good match between the long term nature of its business and capital structure.
The amortization

<<<

 profile is supported by low initial gearing of 54% for the two vessels, young average age for the two vessels of less than 4.5 years and 10 year bareboat contract for "Overseas Tampa".
The Issuer is of the view that it is permitted under the

<<<

 Loan Agreement to provide the Guarantee, as it is a refinancing of the existing liabilities under the BNPP Credit Agreement. Due to some ambiguity in the wording in the Loan Agreement, the Issuer however wishes that the Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

 confirms that the Issuer is permitted to provide the Guarantee.
Pursuant to the Loan Agreement Clause 13.3(i) any refinancing of the BNPP Credit Agreement shall not have amortization profiles of more than 15 years.
The Issuer therefore wishes

<<<

 the Bondholders to approve the 18 Year Amortization and waive the requirement set out in Clause 13.3(i) for the 18 Year Amortization in the CIT Financing.
The Issuer has informed the Loan Trustee that Bondholders representing more than 2 /

<<<

 3 of the Outstanding Bonds are in favour of the Proposal (as defined below).
2. The Proposal
The Borrower proposes a resolution be passed by the Bondholders, whereby the Bondholders approve as follows (the "Proposal"):
a) The Bondholders confirm

<<<

 that the Guarantee is permitted under the Loan Agreement.
b) The Bondholders approve the 18 Year Amortization in the CIT Financing and waive the requirements of Clause 13.3(i) in relation thereto.
c) Clause 9.5 first paragraph of the Loan Agreement

<<<

 shall be deleted in its entirety and be replaced by the following: "The Borrower shall make minimum 50% o f interest payments in cash, increasing to 100% after the Bank Refinancing Date, provided however that the Borrower, on a consolidated

<<<

 basis, has immediatelyfollowing such interest payment: (i) at least USD 10,000,000 o f Cash and Cash Equivalents and (ii) an NIBD to Vessel Value Ratio o f not more than 85per cent."
3. Non-reliance
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders

<<<

 without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee and nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate the Proposal and vote accordingly.

<<<

 It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal, financial and tax advisers regarding the effect of the Proposal.
