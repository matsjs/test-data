1. BACKGROUND
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN NO0

<<<

01032437.9 (the "Loan") issued by Peterson AS (the "Borrower" or the "Company"). All capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") entered into on 27 June 2006, or in this summons unless

<<<

 otherwise stated.
The Borrower has prepared a company update attached hereto (the "Company Update"), which is intended to give an update on the Borrower's financial and operational status and provide background information on the proposed changes

<<<

 to the Loan Agreement. Bondholders are encouraged to read both documents.
The Borrower has during the recent months experienced a declining demand as well as a dramatic change in the market prices for its product range. On this background the

<<<

 Borrower has reviewed its 2009 budgets to estimate the consequences of the market change for the Borrowers economic situation. Through this review a shortfall in available liquidity in the range of NOK 150 mill for 2009 has been identified

To bridge this cash shortfall the Company has initiated several actions, hereunder cost reductions through salary cuts and reduced workweek for a significant part of the workforce. Based on the present budget models there will also be necessary

<<<

 with an agreement with the Company's finance creditors for postponement of certain payments, and a supply of liquidity from external sources. This will involve the Loan (se below) as well as leasing providers and the Company's main bank connection

<<<

 DnB NOR Bank ASA (the "Bank").
The Bank has granted the Company an immediate liquidity supply of NOK50 mill in the form of an increase of the present credit line from NOK 45 mill to NOK 95 mill. The Bank has also granted the Company a further

<<<

 increase of the credit line with NOK 55 mill to NOK 150 mill on certain conditions, hereunder that the Bondholders agree to an extension of the maturity of the Loan from 2010 to 2014. The Bank has also agreed to extend the present factoring

<<<

 facility with an additional NOK 15 mill. For the increase in credit lines and the factoring facility the Bank will extend its existing security in inventory and accounts receivable, and in addition require a guaranty from the shareholders.

<<<

 The security will also be extended to cover any currency fx arrangements, which presently are unsecured.
The contribution from the owners of the Borrower is limited to a NOK 30 mill guaranty to the Bank to secure the increase in credit lines

<<<

.
2. CHANGES IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT
The Borrower puts forward a proposal for changes to the Loan Agreement (the "Proposal") as described in detail below. The proposed changes require approval by a Bondholders meeting.
Interest payable in 200

<<<

9 According to the Loan Agreement interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The Company proposes all interest payable and due in 2009 to be converted to a payin-kind interest and accumulated and added to the principal on each Interest Payment

<<<

 Date.
All interest accumulated shall be payable in 8 equal quarterly amounts commencing at the original maturity date 28 June 2010.
Extension of the term of the Loan The Company proposes to extend the final maturity date from 28 June 2010 to

<<<

 27 June 2014.
Further financial indebtedness The Company requests the Bondholders to accept that the Company incurs new financial indebtedness amounting to NOK 120 million by way of increased working capital facility including a NOK 15 million

<<<

 increase in the factoring financing. For avoidance of doubt, the Company also requests the Bondholders to approve the existing working capital facility of NOK 45 million. Any cancellation by the Company of the NOK 150 million working capital

<<<

 facility to be notified to the Trustee not less than 14 business days prior to such cancellation becomes effective.

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
Dividend restriction The Company is prepared to replace the Allowed Dividend with a no dividend clause

<<<

. Consequently, the Company will not be allowed during the lifetime of the Loan to pay any dividend other than the cash distribution to its owner in order to serve the vendor note provided by the previous owners of the Company as stated in the

<<<

 Loan Agreement.
Call Options The Company offers to the Bondholders to include an early redemption clause for all or parts of the Loan at any time at the following prices of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount:
any time in the year

<<<

 2010 at price 104%; any time in the year 2011 at price 104%; any time in the year 2012 at price 104%; any time in the year 2013 at price 105%; and any time in the year 2014 at price 106%.
Redemption price at final maturity The Loan shall be

<<<

 redeemed on the final maturity date at a price of 106%.
Cash Sweep The Company proposes to introduce a Cash Sweep provision whereby 50% of Free Cash Flow as defined in the Loan Agreement (including adjustment for servicing the vendor note)

<<<

 shall be applied to redeem the Loan. The Company shall pay an additional fee of 2% flat on any amount redeemed according to the Cash Sweep provision.
Additional security The Company agrees that the Loan shall be granted additional security

<<<

 by way of a 2nd priority floating charge in the inventory of Peterson Linerboard AS and Peterson Emballasje AS ranking behind the current 1st priority pledge to DnB NOR Bank ASA
For additional information upon the Borrower and the Proposal

<<<

, please refer to the Company Update.
3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
Based on its current financial situation, the Borrower is of the opinion that the Bondholders are offered a fair and balanced solution by the proposed amendments to

<<<

 the Bond Loan Agreement.
The Borrower has an obvious need to strengthen its cash position through 2009, and probably further on, depending on the development in the market place in the coming years. If the Company achieves to perform in accordance

<<<

 with the prognosis for the years ahead, it will probably have the necessary liquidity to serve its entire obligations through the period up to the maturity of the Loan, provided that the actions outlined in the Company Update are carried through

<<<

.

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
There is however a substantial degree of uncertainty related to the cash supply from the Bank. The increase in credit lines has no long commitment, and the entire credit line and factoring facilities is effectively

<<<

 granted on an "on demand" basis from 2010. It appears clearly to be an element of unbalance regarding the Banks requirement of a considerable extension of the Loan without any commitment from the Bank to a long term credit facility to the Borrower

<<<

. This is likely to have a negative effect on the proposed cash sweep arrangement, thus the Bank will be in the position to drain any cash accumulation through a decrease in the credit lines. These considerations have been presented to the Bank

<<<

, but the Bank has so far not been willing to reconsider the present terms for granting additional credit lines.
It is however important to emphasize that the Borrower is in a difficult position, and the consequences of a rejection of the Proposal

<<<

 from the Bondholders is uncertain and hard to assess.
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders should independently evaluate whether the proposed changes

<<<

 are acceptable.
The Bondholders should however note that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Borrower will still not be in strong financial position and will have challenges going forward.

It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with

<<<

 tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences of the Proposal.
For further information about the Borrower, please refer to the Company Update and to the web site www.peterson.no.
The Borrower has engaged Pareto Securities AS ("Pareto") as

<<<

 its financial advisor with respect to the Proposal. Bondholders may accordingly contact Pareto Securities Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70 for further information.
