Summons for Written Resolution - Issuance of new Liquidity Bonds and appointment of Advisors
Nordic Trustee AS (previously Nordic Trustee ASA) (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (together the "Bondholders

<<<

") in the abovementioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue"), a bond loan of USD 939,100,570 issued by Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. (the "Issuer" and collectively with its respective subsidiaries and affiliates, the "Group") pursuant

<<<

 to a bond agreement dated 24 January 2014 (as amended and restated from time to time, the "Bond Agreement").
Capitalized terms used herein (including any attachment hereto) shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement and applicable

<<<

 Security Documents unless otherwise defined herein.
This summons for a written resolution (the "Summons") is hereby issued at the request of an ad hoc group of Bondholders (the "Ad Hoc Group") that represents that its members hold, as of 1

<<<

 December 2017, in excess of 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Bonds.
The information in this Summons fo r Written Resolution is provided by the Ad Hoc Group, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever

<<<

 related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND
1.1. Introduction
In connection with the ongoing negotiations and latest development of the financial situation of the Issuer and the Group (as further described under section 1.2 below), the Issuer

<<<

 has determined that it will need additional contingency funding in order to safeguard the assets of the Group. To this end it is contemplated that the Issuer will issue new bonds in the amount of up to USD 75,000,000 by way of an initial tranche

<<<

 of USD 25,000,000 which may be increased by way of tap issues (the "Liquidity Bonds"). Further, in order to facilitate Bondholders having access to advice and assistance in relation to the ongoing negotiations and latest developments, the Issuer

<<<

 intends to pay the fees and expenses of certain professional advisors. Additionally, the Ad Hoc Group has requested the Bond Trustee to assist them in recovering their costs and expenses in connection with resolving the Events of Default under

<<<

 the Bond Agreement. Such costs and expenses are further described below under section 4. At the Ad Hoc Group's request, the Bond Trustee has proposed that the Issuer reimburse such costs and expenses, and the Issuer is prepared to reimburse

<<<

 such costs on the terms and conditions to be agreed with the Bond Trustee.
An overview of the recent development of the economic situation of the Group can be found in section 1.2 below.
1.2. The economic situation of the Group
On 11 August

<<<

 2017, the Issuer issued a press release disclosing the request and final terms by Petroleos Mexicanos ("Pemex") for a series of amendments to the drilling contracts between the Group and Pemex

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlts gate

<<<

 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

for the Primus, Laurus, Fortius, Decus, and Impetus rigs (collectively, the "Pemex Proposal")- As stated in the press release, Pemex had advised the Issuer that Pemex may terminate the drilling contracts if the

<<<

 final terms were not accepted. The Pemex Proposal involved a substantial change in the economic premises for the drilling contracts, which could not be implemented without a restructuring of the Group's debt being earned out, and following

<<<

 the Pemex Proposal the Group initiated negotiations with its creditors, including the Ad Hoc Group, with an aim to reschedule or restructure its indebtedness to create a suitable capital structure.
In response to the 11 August 2017 Issuer press

<<<

 release, and in contemplation of Pemex's threatened termination of the drilling contracts, the Ad Hoc Group stated its support for the Pemex Proposal and the implementation of certain amendments to the Bond Agreement necessary to implement

<<<

 the Pemex Proposal and maintain the uninterrupted operational performance of the affected drilling rigs. However, after it became clear that the Group wanted to pursue a course without the support of the Ad Hoc Group, the negotiations came

<<<

 to an end.
On 28 August 2017, the Issuer announced its own proposal for a comprehensive restructuring of the Bonds (the "Issuer's Proposal"). As the Issuer explained in its announcement, the Issuer's Proposal was designed to "exchange [the

<<<

 Bonds] for a package of new securities, including new senior notes, new preferred equity, new common equity, cash and the Primus rig." In response to the Issuer's Proposal, the Ad Hoc Group sent another letter to the Issuer, dated 28 August

<<<

 2017, reiterating the Ad Hoc Group's support for the Pemex Proposal and rejecting the Issuer's Proposal. The Ad Hoc Group stated in its 28 August 2017 letter that "there is no justification for the [Bondholders] to undertake a material debt

<<<

 for equity conversion given the Company's current financial and operational condition, including the Ad Hoc Group's support for the [Pemex Proposal]."
On 11 September 2017, Perferadora Oro Negro, S. de R.L. de C.V., the Charterer under the

<<<

 Bond Agreement, filed a voluntary petition for admittance into an insolvency proceeding known as a "concurso mercantil" in the Second District Court in Mexico City, Mexico (the "Charterer's Concurso Filing"). It was not until 21 September 

<<<

2017 that the Issuer issued a press release disclosing the Charterer's Concurso Filing. The Bond Trustee, acting at the direction of the Ad Hoc Group, among other things, subsequently (i) declared an Event of Default as a result of the Charterer

<<<

's Concurso Filing and (ii) exercised its rights under the Issuer Share Charge and each Rig Owner Share Charge to procure (a) the removal of all directors (other than the Independent Director appointed pursuant to Clause 13.5(a) of the Bond

<<<

 Agreement) from the boards of the Issuer and each Rig Owner and (b) the appointment of certain persons selected by the Ad Hoc Group as directors on the boards of the Issuer and each Rig Owner (each newly constituted board, a "New Board").
On

<<<

 1 October 2017, the Issuer failed to (i) make certain payments as required under the Clauses 10.4.1 and 13.4(b) of the Bond Agreement and (ii) comply with the Liquidity covenant set forth in Clause 13.7(a) of the Bond Agreement. In response

<<<

, the Bond Trustee, acting at the direction of the Ad Hoc Group, among other things, exercised its rights under the Issuer Share Charge to procure the transfer of the shares of the Issuer to a newly formed Singapore holding company, OND Pte

<<<

. Ltd. As a result, the shares of the Issuer are now indirectly under the control of a foundation known as "Stiftelsen N T Refectio". Stiftelsen NT Refectio is a non-profit foundation established by the Bond Trustee for the purpose of acquiring

<<<

 assets in connection with the management of bond loans and acting in the interest of bondholders.
On 6 October 2017, it was disclosed that the Charterer was preliminarily admitted to concurso mercantil.
On 6 November 2017, it was disclosed

<<<

 that the Parent of the Issuer, Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S.A.P.I. de C.V., had also filed for, and been preliminary admitted to, concurso mercantil (the

"Parent's Concurso Filing" and, collectively with the Charterer

<<<

's Concurso Filing, the "Concurso Filings").
Furthermore, it has become clear that the former board of the Issuer and the Rig Owners (but not the Independent Director appointed pursuant to Clause 13.5(a) of the Bond Agreement), based on a purported

<<<

 power of attorney granted in 2014, have sought to bring the Issuer and the Rig Owners into the concurso mercantil proceedings of the Charterer and Parent.
1.3. The Events of Default
It has become clear that the Group has breached the Bond Agreement

<<<

 in multiple ways. The Events of Default include, but are not limited to, the following:
a) Payment Default. The Issuer failed to repay an amount of USD 23 million on 1 October 2017, which is an Event o f Default under to Clause 15.1 (a) of

<<<

 the Bond Agreement.
b) Restructuring Proposal. On 28 August 2017 the Issuer presented the Issuer's Proposal for a comprehensive restructuring of the Bonds. Such action is an Event of Default pursuant to Clause 15.1 (f) (i) under the Bond Agreement

<<<

.
c) Breach of financial covenant. The Interim Budget Period expired on 1 October 2017 and as of such date the Issuer's consolidated Liquidity was approximately USD 8 million, which is approximately USD 12 million less Liquidity than required

<<<

 by Clause 13.7 (a) and is therefore an Event of Default pursuant to Clause 15.1 (b) under the Bond Agreement which is not capable of remedy given the financial situation of the Issuer.
d) Concurso Filings. Each of the Concurso Filings is considered

<<<

 to be an Event of Default under Clause 15.1 (g) (i) (Insolvencyproceedings and dissolution) of the Bond Agreement.
1.4. Way forward
Since 3 October 2017, the New Board of the Issuer has been working with the Bond Trustee and the Ad Hoc Group

<<<

 to resolve the financial and operational distress of the Issuer and to implement a valuemaximizing solution.

<<<

) and/or the Security Agent; (ii) all claims other than those mentioned in (i) above and (iii), (iv) and (v) below (being any claims, liabilities or debts owed in connection with the recovery of the Existing Bonds and Liquidity Bonds or taking

The Issuer and the subsidiaries of the Issuer shall be jointly and severally responsible for paying all fees and expenses and any indemnification of the Advisors. All fees and documented expenses shall be paid in cash without any deduction

<<<

 or withholding taxes or other amounts.
In the event that the Issuer and its subsidiaries do not reimburse any of the Advisors' fees, expenses, or indemnifications, the Bond Trustee shall, upon notification from an Advisor (a "Payment Notification

<<<

"), seek reimbursement from the Issuer under the Bond Agreement and the Bonds. In addition, the Bond Trustee shall be authorised to make payments of the Advisors' fees and expenses and shall be required to make such payments to the extent that

<<<

: (i) any of the Advisors' fees and expenses remain outstanding; and (ii) the Bond Trustee has received cash proceeds which are still being held by the Bond Trustee at the time when a Payment Notification is received (including interest payments

 cash proceeds which are still being held by the Bond Trustee (including interest payments and principal repayments) with respect to the Bonds. The Funding Bondholders shall be paid ahead of any payments of principal and interest on the Bonds

 but after the fees and other expenses of the Bond Trustee. The effect of this will be that the Advisors' fees and expenses and any indemnification will be borne on a pro rata basis by all Bondholders rather than only the Funding Bondholders

<<<

. If the Issuer and its subsidiaries are not liable for any such costs, then the Funded Amounts will be deducted from the Bond Recoveries.
