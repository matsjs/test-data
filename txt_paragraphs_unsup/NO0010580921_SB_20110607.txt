 million 10.00% Remedial Cayman Limited Callable Bond Issue 2010/2012 ISIN NO 001 058092.1

REQUEST FOR AUDITED PRESENTATION

Oslo, 7 May 2011

1. INTRODUCTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders

<<<

 (the "Bondholders") of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001 058092.1 (the "Loan") issued by Remedial Cayman Limited (the "Company").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in

<<<

 the loan agreement governing the Bonds dated 28 June 2010 between the Company and the Loan Trustee (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated in this summons.
2. BACKGROUND
Certain Bondholders holding an aggregate of more than 10 % of

<<<

 the Bonds (the "Requesting Bondholders") have approached the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' Meeting with respect to the Loan in order to propose (the "Proposal") a resolution to instruct the Loan Trustee to (i) release all reports received

<<<

 with regards to the Loan, (ii) to initiate an audit relevant to the Loan, and (iii) to withhold success fee for the advisors.
The request for the Bondholders' Meeting from the Requesting Bondholders is attached to the summons.
3. COMMENTS FROM

<<<

 THE LOAN TRUSTEE
The original issuer, Remedial Cyprus Public Company Limited ("Remedial Cyprus"), filed 17 February 2010 a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. Remedial Cyprus also filed for the bankruptcy court to

<<<

 sell substantially all of its business and assets to a nominee of the holders of the US$210 million FRN secured callable bonds 2007/12 issued by Remedial Cyprus on 23 March 2007, with ISIN NO 0010360340 (the "Remedial Cyprus Bonds"),
In order

<<<

 to facilitate the sale, it was necessary to establish a new company, Remedial Cayman Limited (the Company, as defined above), which should be the sole holder of all the Remedial Cyprus Bonds. Accordingly, the holders of the Remedial Cyprus

<<<

 Bonds (the "Original Bondholders") resolved on 10 March 2010 to transfer all of the Remedial Cyprus Bonds to the Company. In return, the Original Bondholders became 100% owners of the Company, and

their holding of Remedial Cyprus Bonds was exchanged with Bonds in the Loan (as defined above).
According to the new structure

<<<

, the Company is now 100% owner of the Remedial Cyprus Bonds, and the Original Bondholders became sole owner of the Company and Bondholders in the Loan.
All the rights connected to the Remedial Cyprus Bonds vests today with the Company, and

<<<

 the Company's sole purpose is being an SPY which shall accomplish the necessary steps to maximize the proceeds for the Original Bondholder based on the Remedial Cyprus Bonds (the "Operations"). The Company must in this respect be regarded as

<<<

 a tool in the recovery process for the Original Bondholders, and is therefore not to be regarded as an ordinary issuer.
AMA Capital Partners ("AMA") is appointed as management of the Company and Bingham McCutchen is appointed as legal advisors

<<<

 (together the "Advisors"). There has been no formal steering committee appointed during the operations, and all bondholders have had full access to the Advisors at all times.
The Operations have resulted in two payments made to the Bondholder

<<<

, as USD 5,000,000 was paid 28 April 2008 and USD 26,500,000 was paid 15 April 2011. Information regarding these payments has been sent to the Bondholders.
During the process of Operations, written information and financial reports to the Bondholders

<<<

 has not been given priority by the Advisors, Bondholders have however been invited to Bondholder conference calls. An offer was made by Bingham to minute calls, but this was rejected by the majority of bondholders on the calls on the grounds

<<<

 of unnecessary cost. It is also not market practice for informal bondholder calls to be minuted. The Requesting Bondholders have during the process expressed discontent with lack of written information and financial reports. A written report

<<<

 was sent from AMA to the Loan Trustee on 27 May 2011, and published at Stamdata the same day. The report was prepared independent of the Proposal.
The Loan Agreement for the Loan was, in order to save time and effort, drafted with much the

<<<

 same reporting covenants as the bond agreement for the original Remedial Cyprus Bonds. Taking into account the Company's purpose as a tool in the recovering process, the Loan Trustee has not applied heavy pressure on the Company to produce

<<<

 Quarterly Financial Reports. The Bondholders' meeting held 21 June 2010 gave the Loan Trustee a wide mandate provided that the Loan Trustee consulted with the Bondholders and the Advisors. There has continuously been a dialogue with the Advisors

<<<

, and a majority of the Bondholders have been consulted on various occasions. It has therefor been the Loan Trustee's understanding that all actions have been within the intention of the mandate and in accordance with the wish of the majority

<<<

 of the Bondholders. The Loan Trustee was involved in all bondholder calls and understood from these calls that a majority of the Bondholders did not want written reports provided, mainly due to the risk of leaks of information stemming from

<<<

 bondholder calls, and that dispersion of written documentation at that point could have further negative impact on the business opportunities and as such jeopardize the Operations. There was evidence from earlier calls that matters being discussed

<<<

 on the bondholder calls were being leaked.
In the opinion of the Loan Trustee the requirement for written information and financial reports is in general understandable. On the other hand this is, in the experience of the Loan Trustee, not

<<<

 requirements which has generally been given priority in similar recovery processes recent years.

According to the Proposal, the Loan Trustee shall be instructed to release all reports and accounts received

<<<

 related to the Loan. To the information of the Bondholders the Loan Trustee is not in possession of any further written information from the Advisors/Company which has not been released.
Further to the Proposal, the requested financial report

<<<

 should be "properly audited''. This is a requirement which may be imposed on the Company. It is to be mentioned that an audit as proposed may be costly, and will ultimately be at the Bondholders' expense, as all the outcome of the Company will

<<<

 be part of the bondholders' recovery. The Advisors has estimated that the cost of an audit could be as much as USD 1 million.
The Proposal from the Requesting Bondholders also proposes that "i f the Loan Trustee is not capable to compile and

<<<

 release a meaningful report, that has been properly audited, o f the funds it has managed due to lack o f information from service providers like AMA, then the Loan Trustee is to withhold the successfe e .....It should be noted that such a

<<<

 withholding may be representing a breach of existing obligations, and the Loan Trustee may thus require indemnities by each individual bondholders instructing such actions.
It should also, for the sake of good order, be mentioned that the Loan

<<<

 Trustee has found it necessary to delete a section from the attached letter from the Requesting Bondholders. The section is a list of individuals with e-mail addresses indicating which institution they represent, which the Requesting Bondholders

<<<

 believe have informally been instructing AMA or the Loan Trustee. The Loan Trustee is reluctant to publish such information without the prior approval from each individual.
The Loan Trustee hereby puts the Proposal forward to the Bondholders

<<<

. Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Loan Trustee. Bondholders should independently evaluate the proposals and vote accordingly.

<<<

; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case

<<<

<<<

 - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the

<<<

 proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other

 May 2011
REQUEST FOR BONDHOLDER MEETING - RESOLUTION TO INSTRUCT NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA TO RELEASE INFORMATION RELATING TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF BONDHOLDERS MONEY.
BACKGROUND
A group of Bondholders have repeatedly requested that Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA (the Loan Trustee) release information regarding the drawdown of Bondholders escrow account and the use of proceeds from the sale of equipment.
We have requested information for more than a year. The Loan Trustee has not been willing to

<<<

 release the information. The principal reason for denying the request has been that AMA Capital Partners (AMA) was of the opinion that this could somehow jeopardize the sale of the assets. As little sense as it made, we reluctantly accepted

<<<

 that we would have to wait.
Subsequent to the sale we have on numerous occasions required a statement of the funds received by the Loan Trustee as security trustee for the bondholders. As of May 26th 2011 we hade still not received any account

<<<

 of costs, expenses, interest computation, repayment profile, premium and other computation of costs relating to the enforcement of the bonds. We are particularly concerned about remunerations or cost relating to any advisors or other service

<<<

 providers like AMA, or Bingham, including the Loan Trustee.
We have been invited to listen in on Bondholder Conference Calls in which AMA "walked" Bondholders "through the numbers". We have never before experienced having assets of this magnitude

<<<

 managed in what seems to be a deliberate paperless reporting system. The lack of agenda, minutes, reports, or any other written documentation relating to the proper governance of our interests made the bondholders conference calls completely

<<<

 meaningless for anyone who was not already benefitting from privileged information. To us this process resembles a gross abuse of a dominant position imposing an unreasonable disadvantage to those bondholders not having access to inside information

<<<

 of this kind.
AMA sought support for its alternating strategies from what was termed a Steering Committee. If the Steering Committee was the same as the Bondholders conference calls this was never confirmed. What mandates the Steering Committee

<<<

 gave AMA, was never, to our knowledge, confirmed in writing. It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether the

relative failure of the restructuring process was caused by the Steering Committees misguided instructions, or AMA's poor execution

<<<

.
During the last few weeks we have once more required the Loan Trustee to release the accounts. Once more our request was denied. We have received a written explanation from the Loan Trustee that AMA was not willing to release any documentation

<<<

 on the grounds that the "majority of Bondholders do not want a report". A further justification has not been given. We were once more given the opportunity to be "walked through the numbers" by AMA's Ken Becker, but we have declined, as these

<<<

 reports are vague, unaccountable, and therefore unreliable.
We strongly believe that the lack of information has put our bonds in a huge trading disadvantage for the last year, hereby imposing a likelihood of loss on our bonds. We believe that

<<<

 any reasonable concern of secrecy has long gone and that any resolution to obstruct our access to information will be a responsibility for those voting in favour for it with those financial consequences this might have. It is beyond comprehension

<<<

 that AMA and the Loan Trustee would accommodate any group of bondholders requiring them not to submit relevant and useful information to the whole bondholder community. The request has not been passed by a vote at a Bondholders meeting, neither

<<<

 does AMA have access to the registrar of the Bondholders and cannot with any certainty establish which Bondholders constitute a majority.
We understand that the refusal to provide information has been backed by a majority of bondholders consisting

<<<

 of:
On May 26th 2011 we requested that the Loan Trustee summons a Bondholder meeting immediately in order to address the withholding of information. The Loan Trustee did not send out the summons immediately, instead they posted a "Presentation

<<<

" on Stamdata on May 27th, thus making the reasoning in our summons seem illogical. We therefore found it necessary to withdraw the request for a Bondholders meeting, dated May 26th, and substitute it with this one, which takes into account

<<<

 the Loan Trustee and AMA's apparent change of mind. We are, however, neither comfortable with the lack of detail in the unaudited Presentation, nor the reluctant manner in which it was compiled and released.

We therefore feel that it is necessary

<<<

 that the Bondholders receive a properly audited report.
The Loan Trustee and AMA have stonewalled our requests for more than a year, but were able to comply, within one day, once a request for a Bondholder meeting was put forth. In our opinion

<<<

 the need for a Bondholder resolution has increased. The apparently hastily compiled list of lump sums posted on Stamdata on May 27th is probably meant to deflect our demand for accountability, but it has in fact exemplified the ad hoc nature

<<<

 in which Bondholders rights have been addressed.
We trust that this time the summons can be expedited without the Loan Trustee superimposing further pre-emptive notices on Stamdata before the issues in the summons have been resolved.
The proposed

<<<

 Bondholder meeting will give all involved parties a chance to use the proper channels for securing a majority decisions which do not give unreasonable disadvantage to certain Bondholders. We will request vote by ballot and that the minutes

<<<

 of the meeting, including the result of the voting, shall be made available to the Bondholders.
It is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting resolve the following:
"That the Loan Trustee is instructed to make available to the Bondholders all

<<<

 reports and accounts relating to the use of the bond proceeds. If the Loan Trustee is not capable to compile and release a meaningful report, that has been properly audited, of the funds it has managed due to lack of information from service

<<<

 providers like AMA, then the Loan Trustee is to withhold the success fee until such information is provided and the service provider has provided an indemnity to such bondholders whom have or may have suffered a loss due to the lack of information

<<<
