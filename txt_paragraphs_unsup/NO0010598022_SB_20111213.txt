"NGAAP" means the generally accepted accounting practice and principles in

<<<

 Norway.
B) The definition of "Book Equity" shall be amended and restated to be read as follows:
"Book Equity" means the consolidated equity as presented in the accounts, calculated in accordance with NGAAP consistently applied.
C) The definition

<<<

 of "Book Total Assets" shall be amended and restated to be read as follows:
"Book Total Assets" means the consolidated book value of the total assets of the Issuer in accordance with NGAAP, excluding goodwill
D) The definition of "Equity Ratio

<<<

" shall be amended and restated to be read as follows:
"Equity Ratio" means the ratio of the Book Equity to Book Total Assets on a consolidated basis for the Group, to be reported within each Reporting Date based on NGAAP
4. EVALUATION OF THE

<<<

 PROPOSED AMENDMENT BY THE COMPANY
Warrants issued by the Company have been accounted as equity instruments in accordance with NGAAP in the parent company and in accordance with IFRS 32 Financial Instrument in the consolidated Group accounts

<<<

. Financial Instruments which include an obligation to issue a fixed number of shares against a fixed payment will be accounted for as equity instruments according to IFSR 32. The 2,500,000 warrants (the Warrants") issued to the Bond Holders

<<<

 in the Bond Issue include two elements;
· upon an IPO of the Company's shares, the holders of the Warrants shall have the right but not the obligation, to exercise the Warrants at a price equal to the IPO-price less a 10 % discount; and
· if

<<<

 an IPO is not completed within 2011, a 10 % reduction of the initial exercise of NOK 50 shall be made for each quarter an IPO is not completed by the Company.
As the discount on the IPO price is not considered to be a fixed exercise price,

<<<

 the Warrants will not qualify as an equity instrument under IFRS and will have to be reclassified from equity to financial obligations.
However, in accordance with NGAAP, the Warrants will qualify as equity instruments in accordance with previous

<<<

 accounting practice implemented by the Company. This gives a different treatment based on NGAAP for the parent company and the consolidated IFRS accounts for the Group.
The Company has chosen IFRS for its Group accounting as the Company plans

<<<

 to list it's shares on a stock exchange.
If the Company shall continue to use IFRS for the consolidated Group accounts, the value of the Warrants will be reclassified from equity to financial obligations. The value of the re classification

<<<

 o f the Warrants will be MNOK 26.

However, the Company will not be

<<<

 able to use IFRS with Warrants accounted in accordance with IFRS 32 without being in breach o f the Equity Ratio o f 25 % covenant in the Bond Agreement (Clause 13.5).
The definition of "GAAP" in the Bond Agreement reads: "(....) generally

<<<

 accepted accounting practice and principles in Norway including (if applicable) the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (...)".
To avoid any uncertainty in calculation of the covenant in the Bond Agreement, the Company request

<<<

 that the Bondholders approve a clarification of the definition o f "Equity Ratio" which will allow the Company to continue to use IFRS for it's consolidated accounts by accepting that the calculation o f the Equity Ratio according to article

<<<

 13.5 of the Bond Agreement shall be based on NGAAP. This is in line with current practice as reported to the Trustee for Q1 and Q2 2011.
5. NON-RELIANCE
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations

<<<

 from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

<<<

 and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.) The individual bondholder may authorise the Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder

<<<

 sufficient proof of the ownership o f the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone
