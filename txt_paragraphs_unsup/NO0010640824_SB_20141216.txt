Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
1. INTRODUCTION
Nordic Trustee ASA, (formally known as Norsk Tillitsmann ASA) (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the holders of the 13 per cent. OSX 3 Leasing

<<<

 B.V. Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2012/2015 (the "Bonds" and holders thereof, the "Bondholders") issued by OSX 3 Leasing B.V. (the "Issuer" or "OSX-3") and guaranteed by OSX Brasil S.A., OSX 3 Holding B.V. and OSX Leasing Group B.V. 

<<<

(together, the "Guarantors").
All capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the amended and restated bond agreement for the Bonds (the "Bond Agreement") between, amongst others, OSX-

<<<

3 and the Bond Trustee dated 12 September 2014 (as amended and restated from time to time).
The Bond Trustee has, in consultation with its legal and financial advisers (the "Bondholder Advisers"), been liaising with an ad hoc committe of Bondholders

<<<

 who together represent in excess of 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Bonds (the "Committee") with respect to various issues that are described in further detail below. Members of the Committee have indicated to the Bond Trustee that they are supportive

<<<

 of the proposal set out in section 3 below (the "Proposal").
This summons (the "Summons") is being issued at the request of Bondholders holding more than 1/10 of the Outstanding Bonds.
Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its

<<<

 entirety.
2. BACKGROUND
Events of Default under the Bond Agreement
Following the recent restructuring of the Bonds (the "2014 Restructuring"), the Bond Agreement and various Finance Documents were entered into and/or amended on 12 September

<<<

 2014, to reflect the terms of the restructuring as approved by the Bondholders.
Subsequently, a number of Events of Default have occurred and are outstanding under the Bond Agreement, including but not limited to:

a) Under Clause 15.1(m) (Insurances) of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer was obliged to provide satisfactory evidence to the Bond Trustee that sufficient funds were in an escrow

<<<

 account to pay due and payable insurance premia, by no later than 1 October 2014. On 1 October 2014, the Issuer informed the Bond Trustee that it did not have any funds available to it in order to comply with this obligation. Consequently,

<<<

 an Event of Default occurred and is continuing. The Bond Trustee declared this Event of Default in a letter to the Issuer and the Guarantors dated 2 October 2014, pursuant to which the Bond Trustee confirmed that although it was not declaring

<<<

 the Outstanding Bonds to be due for immediate payment, nor making a demand on the Guarantees, it reserved the right to do so at any time; and
b) Under Clause 15.1(f) of the Bond Agreement, it is an Event of Default if any Obligor has a substantial

<<<

 proportion of its asset attached or subject to distraint whch is not discharged within 10 Business Days of such event occurring. On 4 November 2014, the Bond Trustee notified the Issuer that an Event of Default had occurred as a result of attachments

<<<

 over the FPSO that were obtained by order of the Brazilian court in favour of a creditor of the Ultimate Parent. Again, the Bond Trustee confirmed that although it was not declaring the Outstanding Bonds to be due for immediate payment, nor

<<<

 making a demand on the Guarantees, it reserved the right to do so at any time.
Current Status of Charter Contract
Pursuant to the Charter Amendment Agreement that was entered into as part of the 2014 Restructuring, the terms of the Charter

<<<

 Contract were amended to reflect the agreed restructuring terms.
Under the Charter Contract, OSX-3 invoices the Charterer in arrears on a monthly basis and the Charterer is obliged to pay the invoiced amount within thirty (30) days of the invoice

<<<

 being delivered to the Charterer. If the Charterer fails to pay the invoiced amount when due:
a. An Owner Termination Event shall occur under the Charter Contract if the Charterer fails to pay the invoiced amount within the relevant grace period

<<<

 (fifteen (15) Business Days (as defined in the Charter Contract) after written notice of such non payment has been given by OSX-3 to the Charterer); and
b. The Charterer shall, on demand of OSX-3, pay default interest on any outstanding amount

<<<

 at a rate of 5% p.a..
As has previously been announced, OSX-3 invoiced the Charterer for September's charter hire on 30 September 2014 (the "September Invoice"), which invoice was due to be paid by the Charterer on or before 30 October 201

<<<

4. The Charterer failed to pay the September Invoice when due, and OSX-3 provided written notice of such non-payment to the Charterer on 3 November 2014. The Charterer paid the amount outstanding under the September Invoice on 26 November 2

<<<

014, which was the last day of the grace period.
On 7 November 2014, the Bond Trustee gave notice to the Issuer and to the Charterer that, as a result of the outstanding Events of Default under the Bond Agreement, the "Enforcement Time" had

<<<

 occurred under the Charter Contract Assignment and that, consequently, the Bond Trustee is entitled to exercise any of the Issuer's rights under the Charter Contract.
OSX-3 invoiced the Charterer for October's charter hire on 31 October 20

<<<

14 (the "October Invoice"), which invoice was due to be paid by the Charterer on or before 1 December 2014.

2 -

-

300668532 v6

The Charterer failed to pay the October Invoice when due, and OSX-3 provided written notice of such non-payment

<<<

 to the Charterer on 2 December 2014. The grace period for paying the October Invoice (if any Owner Termination Event is to be avoided) expires on 23 December 2014. As at the date of this Summons, the Charterer has not communicated to the Bond

<<<

 Trustee whether or not it intends to pay the October Invoice.
Therefore, the Charterer is currently in default of its obligations under the Charter Contract, and there is an outstanding payment default under the Charter Contract (the "Payment

<<<

 Default"). If the October Invoice is not paid by OGX in full on or before 6pm (Rio de Janeiro time) on 23 December 2014 (the "Payment Deadline"), an Owner Termination Event shall occur under the Charter Contract.
OGX Bankrutpcy
Under Brazilian

<<<

 law, the Bond Trustee has a number of options available to it in connection with the Payment Default, including but not limited to:
a. Initiating bankruptcy proceedings against the Charterer and the Charterer Guarantor (the "Bankruptcy Route

<<<

"); and
b. Initiating enforcement action against the Charterer and the Charterer Guarantor (the "Enforcement Route" and together with the Bankruptcy Route, and any other Brazilian remedies considered to be appropriate by the Bond Trustee, the

<<<

 "Brazilian Remedies").
Conscious of its duty to protect the Bondholders' rights and interests, the Bond Trustee is therefore seeking instructions and authority from the Bondholders to pursue one or both of the Brazilian Remedies in the event

<<<

 that the Charterer fails to cure the Payment Default on or before the Payment Deadline.
As per the Proposal, it is suggested that the Bondholders authorise the Bond Trustee to take such action in consultation with the Bondholder Advisers and

<<<

 as directed in writing by Bondholders who together hold in excess of 50% of the Outstanding Bonds (the "Majority Bondholders").
Before it pursues any of the Brazilian Remedies, the Bond Trustee is entitled to require one or more Bondholders

<<<

 to provide it with an indemnity in a form satisfactory to the Bond Trustee (an "Indemnity"). For the avoidance of any doubt, amounts paid to the Bond Trustee by any of the Bondholders under the Indemnity shall be repaid by or on behalf of the

<<<

 Bond Trustee out of recoveries under the Bonds as a priority item after the Bond Trustee has deducted its outstanding fees and expenses but prior to any distributions being made to the Bondholders.
Critical Payments
As is noted above, under

<<<

 the terms of the Charter Contract, the Charterer should pay the charter hire directly into the Retention Account. The Retention Account is pledged and blocked in favour of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders). Aside from the charter

<<<

 rates, which are not freely available to the Issuer, the Issuer has no other source of income to service the Bonds and/or fund working capital costs, save for contributions from its shareholder.
The Bond Trustee anticipates that the Issuer

<<<

 may be unable to fund certain working capital costs that are critical to the interests of the Bondholders on the basis that it does not have any
-3 -
300668532 v6

funds available to it. For example, the Issuer has to date failed to pay the

<<<

 invoices of the Independent Director, and they have so far been paid by the Bond Trustee out of other available funds. Clearly, it is critical to the Bondholders' interests that the Independent Director's fees are paid so that the Independent

<<<

 Director remains in office in order to represent the Bondholders' interests on the board of the Dutch Obligors. This is particularly important in light of the outstanding Events of Default under the Bond Agreement. In these circumstances, it

<<<

 is clearly in the Bondholders' interests to arrange for payment of the Independent Directors' fees to be made on behalf of the Issuer. Examples of other payments that are critical to the interests of the Bondholders include the payment of insurance

<<<

 premia (e.g. directors and officers or otherwise).
Therefore the Bond Trustee is seeking instructions and authority from the Bondholders to pay certain amounts that the Bond Trustee, in consultation with the Bondholder Advisers, considers are

<<<

 necessary to be paid in order to protect the interests of the Bondholders, and which the Issuer is obliged to pay under the Finance Documents but has failed to pay (the "Critical Payments").
Whilst neither the Bond Trustee nor the Bondholders

<<<

 are under any obligation to meet the costs of any of the Critical Payments, notwithstanding this, in the circumstances, it may be in the interests of the Bondholders for such amounts to be paid using funds otherwise available to the Bond Trustee

<<<

 and the Bondholders. Payment of any Critical Payments by the Bond Trustee shall not constitute any assumption or obligation for the Bond Trustee to make future or additional Critical Payments. Any Critical Payments that are paid shall be said

<<<

 to be paid expressly on behalf of the Issuer.
As is set out in the Proposal, it is suggested that the Bondholders authorise the Bond Trustee to pay the Critical Payments in consultation with the Bondholder Advisers and as directed in writing

<<<

 by the Majority Bondholders.
Pursuant to Clause 13.4(f) of the Bond Agreement, at closing of the 2014 Restructuring, an amount of c.3.2m was transferred from the Retention Account to a segregated account in the name of the Bond Trustee (on

<<<

 behalf of the Bondholders) (the "Segregated Funds") in order to implement the terms of the 2014 Restructuring. It is proposed that the Bond Trustee be authorised and instructed, in consultation with the Bondholder Advisers and as directed in

<<<

 writing by the Majority Bondholders, to apply some or all of the Segregated Funds towards payment of the Critical Payments.
December Coupon and Retention Account
As a result of the Charterer paying the September Invoice, there is currently

<<<

 $7,500,000 standing to the credit of the Retention Account (the "Retention Account Funds"). Under the terms of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer is due to pay interest to the Bondholders on 22 December 2014 in an amount equal to US$16,775,998

<<<

.09 (the "December Coupon"). There are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the Retention Account to pay the December Coupon in full, and this will be the case even if the Charterer pays the October Invoice in full prior to the Interest

<<<

 Payment Date.
In light of the current circumstances, notably the outstanding Events of Default under the Bond Agreement and the outstanding Payment Default under the Charter Contract, the Bond Trustee is seeking instructions from the Bondholders

<<<

 as to how to apply the funds standing to the credit of the Retention Account, and more particularly, to what extent (if at all) the Retention Account Funds should be applied towards partial payment of the December Coupon.

4 -

30066853

<<<

2 v6

As per the Proposal, it is suggested that the Bond Trustee does not apply any of the Retention Account Funds towards partial payment of the December Coupon at the present time. The rationale for this is that it is not clear whether the

<<<

 Charterer will continue to pay the charter hire under the Charter Contract and if it does not, then the Bond Trustee may be instructed to pursue the Brazilian Remedies and/or to take further enforcement action in relation to the Obligors. In

<<<

 these circumstances, the Bond Trustee may incur costs and expenses in connection with taking such action, which will either need to be funded by means of a new funding requirement, or by using other funds available to the Bond Trustee. In the

<<<

 circumstances, it is proposed that the Bond Trustee shall be entitled to apply the Retention Account Funds toward meeting the costs of any Brazilian Remedies, should the Bond Trustee consider such action to be necessaiy in order to protect

<<<

 Bondholders' interests.
Given that the Segregated Funds also derive from the Retention Account and are in the possession of the Bond Trustee, it is also proposed that the Bond Trustee be authorised to apply the Segregated Funds towards meeting

<<<

 the costs of any Brazilian Remedies (if pursued by the Bond Trustee).
Nothing in this Summons or the Proposal shall limit the rights of the Bond Trustee under the Finance Documents, or oblige the Bond Trustee to take any action (or refrain

<<<

 from taking any action) if it deemds it to be in conflict with any of its obligations in any respect.
3. PROPOSAL
Based on the foregoing, the Bondholders are asked to approve the following proposal:
"The Bond Trustee is authorised and instructed

<<<

 to:
1. Pursue the Brazilian Remedies, in consultation with the Bondholder Advisers and as directed in writing by the Majority Bondholders, in the event that the Charterer does not cure the Payment Default on or before the Payment Deadline;

<<<


2. In addition to what is already permitted under the Finance Documents, apply some or all o f the Segregated Funds towards payment o f the Critical Payments, in consultation with the Bondholder Advisers and as directed in writing by the Majority

<<<

 Bondholders, and/or towards meeting the costs o f the Brazilian Remedies (ifpusued); and
3. Retain the Retention Account Funds fo r the time being, rather than applying them towards the December Coupon, and, in addition to what is already permitted

<<<

 under the Finance Documents, in the event that the Bond Trustee pursues the Brazilian Remedies to apply the Retention Account Funds towards meeting any associated costs".
4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
The request is put forward to the Bondholders

<<<

 without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
