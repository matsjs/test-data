 Issue" or "KSH02 PRO Bond" (the bonds under the Bond Issue hereinafter defined as the "Bonds")), issued by Klaveness Ship Holding AS (the "Issuer" or the "Company").

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer is provided by the Issuer unless explicitly stated otherwise, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1 BACKGROUND
The Company intends

<<<

 to reduce and refinance its aggregate outstanding debt in the bond market by proposing an early mandatory redemption of the KSH02 PRO Bond, as well as extending the debt maturity profile by issuing a contemplated new senior unsecured bond issue

<<<

 of NOK 300 million (the "New Bond Issue") with maturity in 2021. Such early redemption will be funded by cash on the balance sheet as well as the New Bond Issue.
The Issuer is therefore summoning a bondholder's meeting ("Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

") to consider a proposal for a mandatory early redemption of all Bonds under the Bond Issue (the "Conditional Mandatory Redemption"). The Conditional Mandatory Redemption is subject to and shall become effective upon the successful completion

<<<

 and settlement of the New Bond Issue and on such further terms and conditions as set out below in section 2 (The Proposal).
2 THE PROPOSAL
In accordance with Clause 16.2 (Procedural rulesfor Bondholders' meetings) of the Bond Agreement, the

<<<

 Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting in order to obtain the Bondholders' approval to the proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement as described below, pursuant to the authority given to the Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

 under Clause 16 (Bondholders' Meeting) of the Bond Agreement.
Based on the foregoing, the Issuer makes the following proposal (the "Proposal"):

<<<

 shall, subject to completion and full settlement of the New Bond Issue, redeem the Bonds in full at 101.54% of par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest ("Conditional Mandatory Redemption"), no later than 10 Business Days after the settlement

<<<

 date of the New Bond Issue. For the avoidance of doubt, if completion and the full settlement of the New Bond Issue does not occur within 31 December 2016, no mandatory redemption of Bonds shall be made under the Conditional Mandatory Redemption

<<<

, and the Bonds shall mature in full on the Maturity Date at par (100%)."
(ii) Upon approval of the Amendment by the Bondholders' Meeting, the Amendment shall be deemed to form an integral part of the Bond Agreement without either of the Bond

<<<

 Trustee or the Issuer having to sign or execute any additional mutual documentation, subject only to the Issuer's irrevocable written acceptance of the Amendment in a form and content acceptable to the Bond Trustee.
