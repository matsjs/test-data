 Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2014
(together, the "Bonds").
12 February 2009
Petromena ASA (together with its subsidiaries, "Petromena")
On 9 February 2009, an informal group of significant holders of the Bonds requested Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA, the loan trustee for the Bonds (the "Trustee") to summon Bondholders' meetings (the "Meeting Summons"). This Meeting Summons has been formally issued and a bondholder meeting has been convened for Wednesday 18 February 2009. On 9 February

<<<

 2009, Petromena issued a response to the Meeting Summons.
The informal Bondholder steering committee (the "Committee") is therefore writing this letter to all holders of the Bonds (the "Bondholders") to ensure that Bondholders are fully apprised

<<<

 as to the reasons behind, and the purpose of, the Meeting Summons. The Committee notes that the matters addressed in the Meeting Summons have been discussed on conference calls with many other Bondholders, who together hold more than half of

<<<

 all of the Bonds in issue.
A copy of the Meeting Summons and Petromena's response are attached as appendices to this letter.
The Meeting Summons seeks to authorise and instruct the Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders) to engage a financial advisor

<<<

 (the "Financial Advisor"), and to facilitate the ongoing retention of Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham") as legal counsel to the Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders) in the event that Petromena ceases to fund their retention. Additionally

<<<

, the Meeting Summons seeks to provide the Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders) with the authority to appoint a rig broker to work on behalf of the Bondholders should this be in the interests of Bondholders.
The Committee believes that the proposals

<<<

 set forth in the Meeting Summons are necessary to safeguard the interests of Bondholders, and to ensure that at all times they have secure and unfettered access to financial, legal and collateral representation. This will ensure that the Bondholders

<<<

 are adequately and fully represented in discussions with Petromena regarding its current financial situation, and in any discussions that need to occur with other stakeholders and commercial counterparties, and ensure that Bondholders are immediately

<<<

 and adequately represented in the event that Petromena is unable to meet its obligations under the Bond loan agreements which may result in an insolvency of Petromena and/or its subsidiaries. If such a situation does arise, the Bondholders

<<<

 would be best served by having knowledgeable and engaged advisers in place to protect the value of their underlying security and avoid value destruction resulting from a lack of preparedness.
Although Petromena has asserted its willingness

<<<

 to cooperate with the Trustee and Bondholders, the Committee considers that the Company's conduct to date does not reflect that assertion. For example:

1. The Bondholder meeting summons dated 19 December 2008 was issued without any informal

<<<

 consultation with bondholders, when there was sufficient time and opportunity for Petromena to undertake that consultation.
2. To date, despite numerous requests, Petromena has not supplied information clarifying the current status of the original

<<<

 $600 million loan facility from Lloyds TSB Bank.
3. Petromena has not yet provided any confirmation that it has obtained sufficient financing to complete the construction of Petrorig 1.
4. With respect to the Bondholders' Meeting on 16 January

<<<

 2009, Bondholders approved Petromena's proposals conditional on a subsequent agreement being reached which, amongst other things, would provide Bondholders with "control" of the sale of Petromena's rigs and rig construction projects. No agreement

<<<

 could be reached because Petromena was not willing to provide any meaningful control to Bondholders, and offered only information and consultation rights which barely exceeded the rights currently available to Bondholders under the loan agreements

<<<

 for the Bonds.
5. While Petromena has offered to fund a financial due diligence exercise on behalf of Bondholders, this is on a limited scope and non-market terms basis.
Petromena has borrowings from Bondholders in excess of US$800 million

<<<

. The Committee believes that given the current market environment, it is clear that the immediate fiduciary responsibilities of Petromena and its directors are to Petromena's creditors, the largest constituency of which are the Bondholders

<<<

. In the circumstances, therefore, it is clear that the interests of the Petromena equity holders and management are not aligned with those of the Bondholders. Given the duties owed by Petromena to its creditors, it is disturbing to the Committee

<<<

 that Petromena is only willing to provide partial information and access to advisers representing Bondholders, when that access needs to be full and unfettered. This is consistent with market practice in international restructurings.
The Committee

<<<

 wishes Bondholders to be clear about certain specific items in the Meeting Summons:
1. Even though Petromena has offered to cover some fees on an hourly basis while limiting the scope of Financial Adviser's mandate, the Committee believes that

<<<

 given the significant amount of money at stake for Bondholders, it is preferable for Bondholders to fund retention of the Financial Adviser themselves, if this ensures that they have a scope and mandate that is sufficiently broad to permit

<<<

 them to seek to maximize recoveries for Bondholders to the fullest extent possible.
2. Petromena's offer of access to due diligence is welcomed, but Petromena is obliged to provide information to the Trustee regarding its financial condition

<<<

 in any event. Accordingly, this offer does not extend beyond the rights that are already available to Bondholders. However, the due diligence process is only a basic cornerstone of the Financial Adviser's work, which will, if required, extend

<<<

 to a much wider scope in order to achieve a solution for Bondholders that maximizes their recoveries. It is intended that the Financial Adviser would work co-operatively with Petromena to the maximum extent possible.
3. There is no suggestion

<<<

 that a rig broker should be retained by the Trustee at this stage. However, it may become necessary to appoint a rig broker to act on behalf of Bondholders at some point in the future. For example, if Petromena were to enter into insolvency

<<<

. It is prudent for Bondholders

to use the occasion of the Bondholders' meeting to authorize the Trustee to effect this appointment if necessary, and therefore avoid losing time should the appointment of the rig broker be required in the future

<<<

.
4. There is considerable doubt regarding the validity of Petromena's assertion that the appointment of a rig broker as part of a Bondholder led marketing process would result in significantly reduced recoveries for Bondholders. In particular

<<<

, there is every reason to believe that a company controlled process may well be slower and less optimal for Bondholders since it will likely take into consideration the interests of equity holders and other Larsen companies.
5. To date, Petromena

<<<

 has co-operated in funding the retention of Bingham by the Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders). However, were this co-operation to cease, or the Company is no longer in a position to provide this funding, it is imperative that the Trustee has

<<<

 legal counsel immediately available to it to preserve the interests of Bondholders.
The Committee has arranged a conference call for Bondholders, in order to address any questions regarding the Meeting Summons. This will take place at 5.00

<<<

 p.m. Oslo time/ 4.00 p.m. GMT/11.00 a.m. EST on Monday 16 February 2009. The dial-in details for the Fortelus conference line are:

, no action needs to be taken by Bondholders with regard to voting until after the proposed call on Monday 16 February.

Oslo, 9 February 2009

Proposal to appoint AMA Capital Partners as financial advisor and

<<<

 to authorise the Loan Trustee to appoint a rig broker - Summons to Bondholders' Meetings

1. BACKGROUND

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"/"Norsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of bonds (the "Bonds") in the above

<<<

 mentioned loans (the "Bond Loans") with ISIN NO 001031608.6 (the "NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue"), ISIN NO 001039578.3 (the "USDm 300 Bond Issue") and ISIN NO 001035264.4 (the "NOKm 1,600 Bond Issue") where PetroMena ASA (the "Company") and PetroRig

<<<

 III Pte Ltd (as applicable) are the borrowers (the "Borrowers").

All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement related to each of the Bond Loans (the "Bond Loan Agreements") or the summons

<<<

 to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.

Pursuant to the Bond Agreements, a Bondholders' meeting shall be held at the request of Bondholders representing at least 1/10 of an Outstanding Loan (the "Requesting Bondholders") with

<<<

 respect to each issue of the Bonds. NTM has received such request. This summons is solely based on the request and information from Requesting Bondholders. The Borrowers have not been involved in this process. Further, NTM expressly disclaims

<<<

 any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the request and any information provided by the Requesting Bondholders.

We refer to the summons to the Bondholders' meetings, dated 19 December 2008, and the notice from the Bondholders'

<<<

 meeting held on 16 January 2009 (the "January Meeting") in connection with the NOKm 2,000 and the USDm 300 Bonds.

At the January Meeting the proposal to amend the Bond Loan Agreements (the "Resolution") was approved by the requisite percentage

<<<

 of the holders of the relevant Bonds, subject to a subsequent agreement ("Subsequent Agreement") being reached on or before 30 January 2009 which, inter alia, satisfies the following conditions:

(a) sets out an agreed process for the organised

<<<

 and proper marketing of each of the ultra deepwater drilling units (the "Rigs") under construction or owned by PetroRig I, II and IIII, with a view to and, if possible, achieving a sale of each of those Rigs which maximises value, and which

<<<

 sale and marketing process shall ultimately be controlled by the holders of the Bonds;

(b) either approves, or provides a mechanism for approval by Bondholders of the terms of any additional new financing that is raised in connection

<<<

 with the Rig currently under construction by PetroRig I Pte Ltd, as permitted under and in accordance with the Resolution.
The form of Subsequent Agreement proposed by the Company did not provide Bondholders with sufficient control in relation

<<<

 to the sale and marketing of the Rigs, and agreement could not therefore be reached with the Company on a form of Subsequent Agreement which would be approved by the requisite percentage of Bondholders. Accordingly, the Resolutions considered

<<<

 at the Bondholder meeting on 16 January 2009 did not come into effect.
In anticipation of a Subsequent Agreement being reached, certain holders of the Bonds requested, during the week commencing 21 January 2009, that the Company co-operate

<<<

 with the immediate engagement by NTM (on behalf of Bondholders) of a financial adviser to assist Bondholders with, amongst other things, the negotiation of and implementation of the Subsequent Agreement, conducting business due diligence and

<<<

 the raising of additional finance for the Group, including from bondholder-led sources. Discussions are on-going with the Company as to the terms on which they would co-operate with the appointment of a financial adviser to Bondholders but

<<<

 no agreement has yet been reached.
Accordingly, in view of the events referred to above, certain Bondholders have proposed that NTM immediately convene meetings of Bondholders to facilitate Bondholders having access to advice and assistance

<<<

, as necessary, to ensure their interests are fully represented going forward. This would include the immediate retention by NTM (on behalf of Bondholders) of AMA Capital Partners ("AMA") as financial adviser and facilitating the continued engagement

<<<

 of Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham") to the extent this is no longer funded by the Company.
It has also been proposed that the occasion of a Bondholders' meeting be used to provide NTM with the authority to engage a rig broker (for

<<<

 and on behalf of Bondholders) subject to the terms set out in this meeting summons, should it be determined at any stage that this would be in the interests of any Bondholders.
The fees of AMA, Bingham, NTM and any rig broker which is appointed

<<<

 and any other out of pocket expenses of NTM incurred in connection with Bond Loans would be met out of the relevant Bondholders' recoveries, unless the Borrowers agree to meet these fees and expenses.
2. APPOINTMENT OF AMA
Scope of Work
AMA

<<<

 will provide financial advisory services to NTM (on behalf of Bondholders). These services will include conducting a business due diligence in relation to the Company, its subsidiaries, the Rig construction projects and the Petrolia Rig owned

<<<

 by PetroMena Ltd (the "Petrolia Rig"), provided that the Company co-operates in the provision of access to AMA, and advising the Trustee and assisting Bondholders in negotiations and discussions with the Company and other stakeholders and commercial

<<<

 counterparties.

Monthly Retainer

AMA will be entitled to a monthly retainer of USD 70,000 per month for the term of the engagement, which will be for a minimum of two months,

<<<

 from the signing of the engagement letter.

Transaction Fees

(a) Advisory Fee

As part of any general voluntary restructuring whereby the Company is able to raise additional capital, and/or if any or all of the Rigs or Petrolia Rig are sold

<<<

 or the Rigs' construction contracts/projects are sold or otherwise transferred for cash consideration, AMA shall receive (at the closing of such sale(s)) an advisory fee ("Advisory Fee") in respect of each issue of Bonds with respect to which

<<<

 they are appointed, as follows:

(i) in case of a sale in cash equal to 0.25% of the cash proceeds actually recovered by each relevant Bond issue (payable separately out of the proceeds of each Bond issue); or

(ii) in the instance of a voluntary

<<<

 restructuring whereby sufficient additional capital is raised to meet the liabilities of the Company, which are existing and projected as at the date of this Agreement, an Advisory Fee of 0.25% of the face value of each relevant Bond issue

<<<

, payable in cash at the time of the execution of the voluntary restructuring.

(b) Restructuring Fee

If the Bonds are restructured, AMA will be paid a restructuring fee based on the percentage of the relevant Bond issue's face value which

<<<

 is recovered, as set out below.

% of Notes' Face Value Corresponding to Aggregate Consideration
Up to 50.0% Over 50.0% - 65.0% Over 65.0% - 80.0% Greater than 80.0%

Fee
0.00% 0.30% on that amount 0.65% on that amount 1.00% on that amount

<<<



Aggregate Consideration shall mean the total amount of cash and the fair market value of the non-cash consideration paid and to be distributed in respect of the Bonds on the date of the closing of a transaction, including all securities and

<<<

 other property paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by the acquiring party, and shall also include the book value of any liabilities indirectly or directly assumed or acquired or otherwise repaid by the acquiring party in connection with

<<<

 or anticipation of the sale which relates to the Bonds, including the book value of typical working capital liabilities required in the day-to-day operations and the book value of any cash that is in excess of the cash needed for typical working

<<<

 capital needs of the business. In the event that any portion of the Aggregate Consideration is not delivered at closing, is subject to adjustment or is placed in escrow, the fee with respect to such portion of

<<<

 L IT SM A N N ASA
the Aggregate Consideration shall be paid to AMA if and when such consideration is received by the Company.
AMA shall be entitled to receive either an Advisory Fee or a Restructuring Fee but not both.
AMA will also be entitled

<<<

 to reimbursement of its out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with providing its services.
It is proposed that the fees referred to above shall be paid as a priority payment out of cash recoveries on the relevant Bonds. This means that

<<<

 the AMA fees will effectively be shared amongst all of the Bondholders in each issue of Bonds as applicable. The monthly retainers and out of pocket expenses will be shared equally amongst each of the relevant Bond issues meaning that each

<<<

 relevant issue of the Bonds will be liable to pay 1/3 of these amounts. The Restructuring Fee and Advisory Fee will be payable separately by each relevant Bond issue, in accordance with the formulae referred to above.
The AMA Engagement may

<<<

 be terminated on 5 days' notice by either party. The Restructuring Fee and Advisory Fee shall be payable in respect of a transaction consummated within 12 months of the termination date.
NTM shall also agree to indemnify AMA in respect of all

<<<

 losses and liabilities it may incur as a result of the engagement. This indemnity will be capped at US$5 million and shall only be payable out of and to the extent of proceeds being received with respect to the relevant Bond issue. The indemnity

<<<

 shall terminate 12 months after the date of the engagement letter, save in respect of accrued liabilities which have been notified in writing prior to that date by AMA.
NTM shall be entitled to use its discretion, in consultation with Bingham

<<<

, in agreeing the final form of engagement letter for AMA so long as the terms are substantially similar to those described above.
The relevant contact people at AMA are Paul Leand (+(212) 682 2310/ pleand@amausa.com) and Bobby Bowers (+(21

<<<

2) 682-6701 / rbowers@amausa.com) at AMA.
3. APPOINTMENT OF RIG BROKER
The purpose of any appointment of a rig broker would be to conclude a sale of the Rigs (or any of them) or the construction projects relating to them and/or the Petrolia

<<<

 Rig (each, a "Transaction") on behalf of the relevant Bondholders. The scope of the rig broker's work would include the identification of, and negotiation with, potential buyers and investors and working in the best interests of the Bondholders

<<<

.
NTM would have discretion to choose the identity of the rig broker, and agree its terms of remuneration, provided that the fee payable to the rig broker shall not exceed 1% of the aggregate consideration paid in respect of each Transaction

<<<

. The identity and final terms of remuneration of the rig broker would require the approval of 2/5 of the holders of each of the relevant Bond issues. None of the approvals would need to be provided in a Bondholder meeting.
UKDOCS/154017.13

<<<



N O R SK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
It is proposed that these fees would be paid by the Trustee out of any sale proceeds provided to it for distribution to Bondholders as a priority payment prior to it making distributions with respect to the relevant

<<<

 Bonds. This means that the rig broker's fee would effectively be shared amongst all of the relevant Bondholders.
4. COMMITTEE FEES
To date, the fees, costs and expenses of Bingham as legal adviser to the NTM (on behalf of the holders of the

<<<

 US$m 300 Bonds and the NOKm 2,000 Bonds) have been met by the Company. However if, in the future, the Company does not continue to meet these fees and expenses, it is possible that they will need to be funded by individual Bondholders who agree

<<<

 to so fund them (the "Funding Bondholders"). It is also possible that Bingham are retained by NTM also on behalf of the holders of the NOKm 1,600 Bonds. It is proposed that the Bondholder meeting also authorise NTM to pay to Funding Bondholders

<<<

 amounts provided by them in respect of the fees and expenses of Bingham, out of amounts it receives for distribution to Bondholders, and ahead of any fees payable to AMA and/or the rig broker, and ahead of payments of principal and interest

<<<

 on the Bonds. The effect of this will be that these fees, costs and expenses will be born by all Bondholders and not just the Funding Bondholders. NTM would seek to apportion the fees and expenses of Bingham between the relevant issues of Bonds

<<<

 on an equal basis or as it otherwise considers (in consultation with Bingham) to be equitable to each issue of Bonds.
5. SUMMONS FOR BONDHOLDERS' MEETINGS
Bondholders' meetings in the Bond Loans are summoned:
Time: 18 February 2009 at 2 pm

<<<

 (Oslo time) (1 pm London time) Place: the premises of NTM, Haakon VII's gate 1, Oslo (Norway)

 with Bingham) to be equitable to each issue of the Bonds;

 its capacity as rig broker to NTM as a joint second priority (and pro rata to amounts under (e) above) out of amounts received by it from a Transaction prior to making a distribution with respect to any relevant issues of the Bonds.
According

 to the Bond Loan Agreements, with respect to each Bond Loan, the above mentioned proposals require a qualified majority of 2/3 of each Bond Loan represented at the Bondholders' meeting voting in favour of such proposals and (i) a minimum 2

/2014
Oslo, 9 February 2009
Background
Petromena ASA ("the Company") has been informed by the Loan Trustee that a group of bondholders (the "Group") in the loans with ISIN NO 001031608.6 (the "NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue"), ISIN NO 001039578.3 (the

<<<

 "USDm 300 Bond Issue") and ISIN NO 001035264.4 (the "NOKm 1,600 Bond Issue") (together the "Loans") has instructed the Loan Trustee to summon for a bondholder meeting in the Loans ("the Summons").
Petromena's comment to the proposal
In connection

<<<

 with the summons initiated by a minority of the bondholders, Petromena would like to comment on the Summons.
The Company has a clear intention to co-operate and have an open and positive dialogue with the Loan Trustee and the bondholders in

<<<

 the Loans.
Petromena is working intense with the financing of the three new building rigs, currently focusing on Petrorig 1 which is the first rig to be delivered. The Company has asked the bondholders in the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue and the USDm

<<<

 300 Bond Issue to allow for a financing of Petrorig 1 by increasing the allowed carve-out for first lien debt related to Petrorig 1 from USDm 200 to USDm 300. The Company believes that securing financing for Petrorig 1 is of greatest importance

<<<

 now, and the dialogue with banks is good. However, this process will be jeopardized if the bondholders refuse to accept the increased carve-out related to Petrorig 1 shortly.
Furthermore, the Company has done its outmost to postpone the second

<<<

 last yard installments for Petrorig 3 from January 2009 to delivery of such rig in January 2010. Finally, the Company is (as already communicated to the market) working actively to sell at least one of the newbuild drilling rigs. The Company

<<<

 consider themselves to be the best party to lead and carry out such sale. The announcement regarding a MOU for Petrorig 3 of approximately USDm 540 should be a solid evidence of this.
From the time when some of the bondholders in the NOKm 

<<<

2,000 Bond Issue and the USDm 300 Bond Issue demanded that a legal advisor was appointed to represent the bondholders at the cost of the Company in late December 2008, the Company has covered GBP 100,000 of legal costs so far to the law firm

 Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham").

On 2 February 2009, the Company

<<<

 announced their intention to meet the Group's request to hire a financial advisor representing the bondholders in the Loans at a reasonable cost. The Company agreed that the financial advisor should provide financial advisory services to the

<<<

 trustee Norsk Tillitsmann on behalf of all the bondholders. The Company also agreed that these services will include conducting a business due diligence in relation to the Company, its subsidiaries, the Rig construction projects and the Petrolia

<<<

 Rig owned by PetroMena Ltd and advising the trustee in negotiations with the Company and other stakeholders. The Company is also prepared to cover further legal costs for the bondholders, if deemed necessary by the Loan Trustee.
In spite of

<<<

 the Company's willingness to cover the engagement of advisors at reasonable costs, the Company recognizes that the Group proposes to appoint a rig broker, a financial advisor and a legal advisor at their own cost.
A sale of a rig has to be

<<<
