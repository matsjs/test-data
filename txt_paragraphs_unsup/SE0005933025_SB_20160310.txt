<<<

Appendix 1
The Bonds Agent must receive the Voting Form no later than 17:00 (CET), 5 April 2016, by mail, via courier or e-mail to the addresses indicated below under Section 5 F. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded. To be eligible

<<<

 to participate in the Written Procedure a person must fulfil the formal criteria for being a Bondholder on 18 March 2016 (the "Record Date"). This means that the person must be registered on a Securities Account with Euroclear Sweden AB, the

<<<

 CSD, as a direct registered owner (Sw. direktregistrerad ägare) or authorised nominee (Sw. förvaltare) with respect to one or several Bonds. The information in this Notice regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer

<<<

, and the Bonds Agent expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND The Group's main business is to own and develop properties. The Issuer is currently the owner of the properties Stockholm Timotejen

<<<

 19 and Stockholm Timotejen 28 (the "Properties") which are located at Telefonplan in Stockholm. As of today, the zoning plan (Sw. detaljplan) states that the Properties shall be used mainly as offices. There is an ongoing process of re-regulating

<<<

 the permitted use of the Properties to residential by way of adopting a new zoning plan. The process of adopting a new zoning plan has, in relation to the estimate timeline in connection with the issuance of the Bonds, been delayed and is in

<<<

 accordance with a report prepared by Tyréns AB on the instruction of the Issuer estimated to become legally valid (Sw. vinna laga kraft) in July 2016, provided that the approval is not appealed. As a substantial part of the Group's sale and

<<<

 purchase agreements, entered into with potential purchasers of the Properties, are subject to the zoning plan becoming legally valid, the delay in the adoption of the new zoning plan will have an adverse effect of the Group's business, earnings

<<<

 and cash flow, and consequently result in liquidity issues for the Group. In order for the Group to continue its business until the zoning plan becomes legally valid, the Issuer has requested that the Bonds Agent initiate a Written Procedure

<<<

 in order for the Bondholders to consent to amend the Terms and Conditions. Such amendments will, if implemented, enable for the Issuer to raise additional financing by way of a tap issue to fund the Group's business until the date the zoning

<<<

 plan is estimated to become legally valid or until the extended redemption date of the Bonds occurs. 2. AMENDMENT REQUEST (a) The Issuer hereby requests that the Bondholders approve the necessary resolutions to amend the
Terms and Conditions

<<<

 as stated below:
The Final Redemption Date of the Bonds is extended
i. the Final Redemption Date is extended by twelve (12) months until 22 May 2017;
Redemption of Bonds

Appendix 1
ii. the definition of the Call Option Amount will be replaced

<<<

 Redemption Date.
iii. the definition of the First Call Date will be replaced in its entirety with the following wording:
"First Call Date"means 23 May 2016.
iv. Clause 10.1 (Redemption at Maturity) of the Terms and Conditions will be replaced

<<<

 in its entirety with the following wording:
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, o f the outstanding Bonds in full on the Final Redemption Date with an amount per Bond equal to 102.00% o f the Nominal Amount, together with accrued

<<<

 but unpaid interest. I f the Final Redemption Date is not a Business Day, then the redemption shall occur on thefirstfollowing Business Day.
Subsequent Bonds
v. the Issuer will be permitted to, on one or more occasions, issue subsequent Bonds

<<<

 in an aggregated amount of up to SEK 50,000,000 (the "Tap Issue"). Any subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Document.
The amendments in item i.-iv. are hereafter jointly referred to as the "Amendment Request".


<<<

(c) The amendments of the Terms and Conditions in accordance with the Amendment Request shall have immediate effect from (and including) the date when (i) the Bondholders have approved the Amendment Request, and (ii) the Bonds Agent have received

<<<

 satisfactory evidence that the conditions for the Amendment Request as set out in Section 3 are satisfied.
(d) The Bonds Agent shall in its own discretion be entitled to make amendments to the Terms and Conditions on behalf of the Bondholders

<<<

3. CONDITIONS FOR THE AMENDMENT REQUEST The Amendment Request and the amendments of the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions to implement the Amendment Request shall be subject to that:

<<<

<<<

 C. Voting rights and authorisation Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (18 March 2016) in the debt register:
(i) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities Account; or (ii) be registered

<<<

 as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several
Bonds. Bonds registered with a nominee
4

Appendix 1
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered authorised

<<<

 nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed

<<<

 by you.
2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorization. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain

<<<

 authorization directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as bondholder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt

<<<

 register as a Bondholder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary

<<<

 that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one). The Bonds Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish

<<<

 to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorization or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights

<<<

. D. Quorum To approve the Amendment Request, Bondholders representing at least twenty (20) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum. If a quorum does not exist,

<<<

 the Bonds Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure. E. Majority At least 6623 per cent of the

<<<

 Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Bondholders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to the Amendment Request. F. Address for sending replies Return the Voting Form, Schedule 1, and, if applicable, the Power of Attorney/Authorisation

<<<

 in Schedule 2 or other sufficient evidence, if the Bonds are held in custody other than Euroclear Sweden AB, by regular mail, scanned copy by e-mail, or by courier to: (a) By regular mail:
