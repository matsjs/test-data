(B) On 30 November 2017, the Issuer summoned (the "Summons") a Bondholders' meeting (the "Bondholders' Meeting") and put forward to the Bondholders

<<<

 a proposal thereunder to make certain amendments to the First Amendment Agreement. The amendments were approved by the Bondholders' Meeting on 14 December 2017 and were effective from the date of The Second Amendment Agreement (the "Second

 Amendment Date").
(C) Pursuant to the resolution adopted by the Bondholder's Meeting, the cash interest on the Bonds shall be amended to reflect that from 30 June 2017 and until the Final Maturity Date (as defined in the Summons) the cash interest

<<<

 on the Bonds is fixed at 1.25% per annum. This provision shall come into effect by the cash amount payable as interest from the Second Amendment Date will be reduced until the difference between cash interest actually paid between 30 June 

<<<

2017 and the Second Amendment Date has been recovered.
(D) As the Second Amendment Date occurred after the Interest Payment Date 5 April 2018, cash interest from 5 October 2017 to 5 April 2018 was paid to the Bondholders pursuant to clause 

<<<

1.2.4 of the Summons without a corresponding correction of the amounts set out in clause 9.2 of The Second Amendment Agreement. This Agreement is entered into in order to correct this obvious error, and instead of restating clause 9.2 a correction

<<<

 is made in clause 9.1 with clause 9.2 thereby becoming superfluous and therefore deleted.
