Oslo, 25 March 2013 Summons to Bondholders' Meetings 1. INTRODUCTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders

<<<

") of the Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2015 (the "Bonds") issued by Highclere Holdings Limited (the "Company") and guaranteed by Highclere Limited (the "Guarantor" and together with the Issuer, the "Highclere Group"). All capitalised

<<<

 terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Bonds (the "Loan Agreement") between the Issuer and the Loan Trustee dated 25February 2013 (as amended and restated from time to time)

<<<

. Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its entirety. 2. BACKGROUND The Loan Trustee has convened this meeting (the "Bondholders' Meeting") upon the request of certain Bondholders (the "Consenting Bondholders"), holding in aggregate

<<<

, over 2/3 of the Bonds. 3. AMA ENGAGEMENT The Company has agreed to retain AMA Capital Partners ("AMA") to provide financial advisory services pursuant to an engagement letter (the "AMA Engagement Letter") to be entered into between AMA, the

<<<

 Highclere Group and the Loan Trustee. The key provisions of the AMA Engagement Letter are set out below. Given that AMA's role involves seeking to maximise the value of the Company and its assets, and that the Company's sole stakeholders are

<<<

 its Bondholders (at the time of the issuance of the Bonds, also the Company's shareholders), certain matters relating to AMA's engagement are being put to Bondholders for approval. 3.1 Scope of work - AMA is retained to provide financial advisory

<<<

 services to the Company. In addition, Mr Ken Becker ("Mr. Becker"), who is employed by AMA, has been appointed as a director of the Company and the Guarantor. 3.2 AMA's Fees - As compensation for AMA's services hereunder, AMA shall receive

<<<

 the following fees (together, "AMA's Fees"): (a) Monthly Retainer

2/5
A monthly fee of US$ 100,000 payable monthly

<<<

 in advance for a minimum of six (6) months ("Monthly Retainer"). Each monthly retainer beyond the sixth (6th) month will be credited against the Sale Fee (as set forth below), if earned, under the AMA Engagement Letter.
(b) Sale Fee
In the

<<<

 event that the Bonds are restructured, sold in the aggregate to an individual buyer, or redeemed, with the result that the Bondholders receive recoveries and where the Total Consideration (as defined in Schedule 1 to this Summons) is in excess

<<<

 of zero, then AMA shall receive a "Sale Fee" in the amount described below.
Subject to the more detailed terms and conditions as set out in the AMA Engagement Letter, if the Total Consideration is greater than zero but less than $30 million

<<<

, AMA will earn a Sale Fee of $400,000 (the "Base Fee"). If the Total Consideration exceeds $30 million, AMA will earn the Base Fee plus 3% o f the difference between the Total Consideration and $30 million.
(c) Out-of-pocket Expenses
AMA shall

<<<

 further be entitled to reimbursement o f out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the services to be provided under the AMA Engagement Letter.
For the avoidance of doubt, neither AMA nor Mr. Becker will charge any additional

<<<

 fees relating to Mr. Becker's appointment as a director beyond the fees set out in the AMA Engagement Letter (as set out below).
3.3 Payment of AMA's Fees
The Loan Trustee has been asked to agree to that, in the event that (and to the extent

<<<

 that), the Highclere Group is unable to pay amounts due to AMA under the Indemnity, then the Loan Trustee shall pay such amounts to AMA if (i) AMA has notified the Loan Trustee that there are amounts due or pending in connection with the AMA

<<<

 Engagement Letter (a "Payment Notification"), (ii) to the extent it has received cash proceeds which are still being held by the Loan Trustee at the time when a Payment Notification is received (including interest payments and principal repayments

<<<

) with respect to the Bonds (together, the "Bond Recoveries") and (iii) a Bondholders' meeting has made the necessaiy resolutions approving such payments under the Indemnity from the Bond Recoveries.
To the extent the Loan Trustee receives Bond

<<<

 Recoveries; the Loan Trustee shall make payment of AMA's Fees as a priority payment out of the Bond Recoveries ahead of any distribution of principal and interest on the Bonds, and pari passu with any payments made under the Indemnity (as defined

<<<

 below).
3.4 Indemnity
The AMA Engagement Letter provides that the Highclere Group shall provide an indemnity and obligation to reimburse AMA for losses that it may suffer that have arisen from certain actions relating to or arising out of activities

<<<

 performed or services furnished pursuant to the AMA Engagement Letter (the "Indemnity").
The Company shall be responsible for paying all fees and expenses and indemnification of AMA under the AMA Engagement Letter. The Loan Trustee shall only

<<<

 be required to make payment under the AMA Engagement Letter to the extent that (i) the Company has not made payment; (ii) AMA has sent a Payment Notification to the Loan Trustee, (iii) to the extent it has received Bond Recoveries which are

<<<

 still being held by the Loan Trustee at the time when

3/5

a Payment Notification is received; and (iv) a Bondholders' meeting has made the necessary resolutions approving the deduction of AMA's Fees from the Bond Recoveries.

To the extent

<<<

 the Loan Trustee makes a payment arising out of the Indemnity, the Loan Trustee shall make such payment as a priority payment out o f the Bond Recoveries ahead of any distribution of principal and interest on the Bonds, and pari passu with

<<<

 AMA's Fees.

Fredrik Lundberg Schedule 1 - Total Consideration Definition

5/5
Schedule 1
Extract from the AMA Engagement Letter:
"It is envisaged that

<<<

 the Bonds may be redeemed as a result of either (A) a sale, transfer or disposal o f the capital stock o f either the Company, or Highclere Limited (a "Share Sale"), and/or (B) a sale, transfer or disposal of the assets of the Company or Highclere

<<<

 Limited (an "Asset Sale" and together with a Share Sale, a "Sale").
"Total Consideration" shall, subject to the following paragraph, mean the aggregate of (i) the gross amount of cash (if any) and (b) the fair market value of any non-cash consideration

<<<

 (if any), paid on the date of the closing of any Sale. For the avoidance of doubt the Total Consideration shall include all securities and other property paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by an acquiring party, and shall also include

<<<

 any liabilities indirectly or directly assumed or acquired or otherwise repaid by the acquiring party in connection with or anticipation of the Sale. In the event that any portion of the consideration for the Sale is not delivered at closing

<<<

, or is otherwise subject to adjustment or is placed in escrow, the Sale Fee with respect to such portion o f the Total Consideration will be based on the value as o f closing and shall be paid to AMA at closing.
The calculation of Total Consideration

<<<

 for a Share Sale shall be reduced by the difference between the intial $6 million of cash provided to the Company by the Bondholders and any remaining intial cash that has not been spent or allocated to pending expenses that remains on the

<<<

 balance sheet of the Company or Highclere Limited (as applicable) ( the "Uncommitted Cash") at closing of the Share Sale. For the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment to the Total Consideration shall be made in the case of an Asset Sale.
Set out

<<<

 below are two examples of the Sales Fee calcualtions:
Is is assumed the Company has $2 million of Uncommitted Cash available in both examples (i.e. the Company has spent $4 million of the initial $6 million of cash that provided to the Company

<<<

 from the Bonds proceeds
(1) hi the instance where the ARV1 is sold via an Asset Sale for $37 million of Total Consideration, AMA would receive a Base Fee o f $400,000 plus 3% of $7 million (being the difference between $37 million and $30 million

<<<

) which amounts to $210,000, so the total Sale Fee due to AMA would be $610,000.
(2) hi the instance where the ARV1 is sold via a Share Sale (i.e. the shares in the Company or Highclere Limited are sold) for $37million of Total Consideration

<<<

, AMA would receive a Base Fee of $400,000 plus 3% of $5 million (being $37 million, less the Uncommitted Cash, less $30 million) which amounts to $150,000 , so the total Sale Fee due to AMA would be $$550,000."
