8 November 2015
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where Pexip AS (the "Issuer") is the

<<<

 issuer.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 13 November 2014 and made between the Bond Trustee and the Issuer in relation to the Bond Issue (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise

<<<

 stated herein.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. Background The Issuer wishes

<<<

 to enter into a new loan agreement with Innovation Nomay (Innovasjon Norge), pursuant to which Innovation Norway will make available to the Issuer a new loan in the aggregate amount of NOK 2,500,000 (the "Proposed Loan").
The Proposed Loan

<<<

 will be unsecured and entered into on the standard market terms. The Proposed Loan will help the Issuer to finance certain ongoing R&D initiatives.
2. Waiver Pursuant to the section 13.4.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer shall, inter alia

<<<

, not incur, create or permit to subsist any Financial Indebtedness other than the Permitted Financial Indebtedness. The Proposed Loan will not be Permitted Financial Indebtedness, i.e. the Issuer is not allowed to raise the Proposed Loan pursuant

<<<

 to the terms of the Bond Agreement unless the Bond Trustee or the Bondholders' Meeting (as the case may be) in writing has agreed otherwise.
Through the Issuer's offer to exchange Bonds into new shares in the Issuer in June 2015, the outstanding

<<<

 amount under the Bond Agreement was reduced from NOK 35,000,000 to NOK 7.100.000. The Issuer expects that the Group's accounting revenue for 2015 will be approximately NOK 45,000,000. On a pro forma basis after incurring the Proposed Loan,

<<<

 the Group's total interest bearing debt will be NOK 9,600,000 and cash in the bank at end of 2015 is estimated to be over NOK 20.000. 000. Given the limited amount of debt of the Group, the Issuer does not believe that the Proposed Loan will

<<<

 materially and adversely affect the rights or interests of the Bondholders under the Bond Agreement.
