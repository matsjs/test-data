EUR 42,500,000 Perpetual Fixed Rate Resettable Additional Tier 1 Capital Notes

Issue price: 100.00 per cent.

The EUR 42,500,000 Perpetual Fixed Rate Resettable Additional Tier 1 Capital Notes (in Danish: "kapitalbeviser") (the "Notes") will

<<<

 be issued by Saxo Bank A/S (the "Issuer"). Subject to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes", the Notes will constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated

<<<

 debt obligations of the Issuer, as described in Condition 4 (Status of the Notes) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".

The Notes will bear interest on their Outstanding Principal Amounts (as defined in Condition 2 (Interpretation) in "Terms

<<<

 and Conditions of the Notes"), payable semi-annually in arrear on 26 February and 26 August in each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), from (and including) 26 November 2014 (the "Issue Date") to (but excluding) 26 February 2020 (the "First

<<<

 Call Date") at the rate of 9.750 per cent. per annum. The first payment of interest will be made on 26 February 2015 in respect of the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) 26 February 2015. The rate of interest will

<<<

 reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date (as defined in Condition 2 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes") thereafter. See Condition 5 (Interest) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".
The Issuer may elect in its

<<<

 sole discretion to cancel any payment of interest in respect of the Notes at any time, in whole or in part. In addition, a payment of interest in respect of the Notes will be mandatorily cancelled to the extent so required by the Relevant Rules

<<<

 (as defined in Condition 2 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes"). Following any such cancellation of interest in respect of an Interest Period (as defined in Condition 2 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes

<<<

"), the right of the holders of the Notes (the "Holders") to receive accrued interest in respect of such Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will have no further obligation to pay such interest to the Holders. See Condition 6 (Interest

<<<

 Cancellation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".

The Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for redemption and Holders do not have the right to call for their redemption. Subject as provided herein, the Issuer may, at its

<<<

 option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes on the First Call Date or on any Interest Payment Date thereafter at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled. Subject

<<<

 as provided herein, the Issuer may also, at its option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes at any time during the relevant redemption period (as specified in Condition 8.2 (Early redemption upon the occurrence of a Special Event) in

<<<

 "Terms and Conditions of the Notes") at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled upon the occurrence of a Tax Event or Capital Event (each as defined in Condition 2 (Interpretation

<<<

) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes"). Any such redemption is subject to certain conditions. See Condition 8 (Redemption and Purchase) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".

If at any time the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the

<<<

 Issuer and/or the Group has fallen below 7.000 per cent., the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall be reduced. Following any such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts, the Issuer may, at its discretion, reinstate some or all of the

<<<

 principal amount of the Notes, if certain conditions are met. See Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".

<<<

 and nothing may be done that would or might result in the buying of such securities or the holding of a beneficial interest in such securities by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the TMR Rules), other than in accordance

 with the limited exemptions set out in the TMR Rules.

(ii) whether or not it is subject to the TMR Rules, it will not sell or offer

<<<

RISK FACTORS
Prospective investors should read the entire Offering Memorandum and reach their own

<<<

 views prior to making any investment decision.
The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. All of these factors are contingencies that may or may not occur and the Issuer

<<<

 is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring.
Factors which the Issuer believes may be material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are also described below.

<<<


The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes for other reasons

<<<

 which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it and which it may not currently be able to anticipate.
The following is a general discussion of certain risks typically associated with

<<<

 the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership of the Notes. In particular, it does not consider an investor's specific knowledge and/or understanding about risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership of the Notes

<<<

, whether obtained through experience, training or otherwise, or the lack of such specific knowledge and/or understanding, or circumstances that may apply to a particular investor.
Words and expressions defined in the "Terms and Conditions of

<<<

 the Notes" below or elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have the same meanings in this section, unless otherwise stated. References to a numbered "Condition" shall be to the relevant Condition in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.
Risks

<<<

 relating to the Issuer
The Group is exposed to a number of risks, the categories of which are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk
The Group is exposed to a number of risks, which it manages at different organisational

<<<

 levels. The categories of risk are as follows:
 Credit risk: Credit risk is the risk of losses arising because debtors or counterparties fail to meet all or part of their payment obligations.
 Market risk: Market risk is defined as the risk

<<<

 of losses because the fair value of financial assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items varies with market conditions.
 Liquidity risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of losses arising because:
 funding costs become excessive;
 a lack of

<<<

 funding prevents the Group from maintaining its current business model; or
 a lack of funding prevents the Group from fulfilling its payment obligations.
 Operational risk: Operational risk is the risk of losses resulting from inadequate internal

<<<

 procedures, human or system errors, or external events. Operational risk includes legal risk.
Regulatory changes could materially affect the Issuer's business
10

The Issuer is subject to financial services laws, regulations, administrative

<<<

 actions and policies in Denmark and in each other jurisdiction in which the Issuer carries on business. Changes in supervision and regulation, in particular in Denmark, could materially affect the Issuer's business, the products and services

<<<

 offered or the value of its assets. Although the Issuer works closely with its regulators and continually monitors the situation, future changes in regulation, fiscal or other policies can be unpredictable and are beyond the control of the

<<<

 Issuer.
In particular, changes in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID II"), which was adopted by the European Council and European Parliament in January 2014, are expected to become effective in 2016. MiFID II includes provisions

<<<

 regarding trading in certain standardised OTC products, enhanced investor protection and transparency regulation, which are all key issues to the Issuer.
In addition, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation ("EMIR") is expected to impose

<<<

 certain requirements (i) with regard to margin (taking effect in 2015) and (ii) on clearing with respect to certain standardised derivatives (which are expected to take effect in 2014). The Issuer is continuously preparing for the impact of

<<<

 these new requirements.
The Issuer will face increased capital and liquidity requirements as a result of the new Basel III Framework
The final versions of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements

<<<

 for credit institutions and investment firms (the "CRR") and the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (the "CRD IV Directive") were adopted in June 

<<<

2013. The CRR entered into force on 1 January 2014 and the CRD IV Directive was implemented in Denmark in March 2014.
The framework implemented, among other things, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposals imposing stricter capital

<<<

 and liquidity requirements upon banks ("Basel III") in the EU. Each of the CRR and the CRD IV Directive covers a wide range of prudent requirements for banks across EU member states, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions

<<<

 of capital, risk-exposures, leverage ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements. The CRD IV Directive covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual risk assessment) and other measures

<<<

 such as the combined capital buffer requirements, governance and remuneration requirements. As a consequence of the European Banking Authority's (the "EBA") outstanding regulatory technical standards, the Group is subject to the risk of possible

<<<

 interpretational changes in, for example, leverage ratio.
See "Description of the Saxo Bank Group" below for a description of the impact on the Group of the new capital and liquidity requirements.
The Group may have to pay additional amounts

<<<

 under deposit guarantee schemes or resolution funds
In Denmark and other jurisdictions, deposit guarantee schemes and similar funds ("Deposit Guarantee Schemes") have been implemented from which compensation for deposits may become payable

<<<

 to customers of financial services firms in the event a financial services firm is unable to pay, or unlikely to pay, claims against it. In material jurisdictions in which the Group operates, these Deposit Guarantee Schemes are funded, directly

<<<

 or indirectly, by financial services firms which operate and/or are licensed in the relevant jurisdiction. Revised legislation regarding the Danish Deposit Guarantee Scheme (Bank Package IV (as defined below in "Description of the Saxo Bank

<<<

 Group") and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive) redefined the Danish scheme as a premium based scheme such that the participating banks' payments to the scheme will be more stable every year in profit and loss terms. The premium payments

<<<

 will stop when a target level of 1 per cent. of covered net deposits has been reached. The future target level of funds to be accumulated in Deposit Guarantee Schemes and resolution funds across different EU countries may exceed the minimum

<<<

 target levels provided for in the BRRD, Directive 2014/49/EC (the "revised Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive") and in Regulation 2014/806/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure

<<<

 for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund and amending Regulation 1093/2010/EC (the "SRM") (the latter of which will be relevant should

<<<

 Denmark choose to participate in the Single Resolution Mechanism). Following the publication and entry
11

into force of the BRRD and the revised Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive each of these Directives is now subject to transposition

<<<

 into Danish legislation.
The Group may be affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions
The financial services industry generally prospers in conditions of economic growth, stable geopolitical conditions, capital markets that are

<<<

 transparent, liquid and buoyant, and positive investor sentiment. Each of the Group's operating segments is affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions, which can cause the Group's results of operations and financial position to

<<<

 fluctuate from year to year as well as on a long-term basis.
Risks related to the market generally
Set out below is a brief description of certain market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk

<<<

:
The secondary market generally
The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices

<<<

 that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of Notes.
Exchange rate risks and exchange controls
Payment of

<<<

 principal and interest on the Notes will be made in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency

<<<

") other than euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of euro or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor

<<<

's Currency or euro may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to euro would decrease (i) the Investor's Currencyequivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent

<<<

 value of the principal payable on the Notes and (iii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect

<<<

 an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal as measured in the Investor's Currency.
Interest rate risks
Notwithstanding that the rate of interest applicable

<<<

 to the Notes will be reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date thereafter, an investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates during the Initial Period or, as the case may be, during a Reset

<<<

 Interest Period may adversely affect the value of the Notes.
In addition, a holder of securities with a fixed interest rate that will be periodically reset during the term of the relevant securities, such as the Notes, is also exposed to the

<<<

 risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income.
Factors which are material for the purposes of assessing the market risks associated with the Notes
The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors.
Each potential

<<<

 investor of the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:
12

(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the

<<<

 Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum or any applicable supplement to this Offering Memorandum including, but not limited to, any taxation

<<<

 issues related to purchasing and/or holding the Notes;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment

<<<

 will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments, i.e. euro, is different

<<<

 from the currency in which such potential investor's financial activities are principally denominated;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and


<<<

(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Risks related to the

<<<

 structure of the Notes
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are subordinated
Subject to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), the Notes will constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated

<<<

 debt obligations of the Issuer as described in Condition 4 (Status of the Notes).
The Issuer may issue other obligations or capital instruments that rank or are expressed to rank senior to the Notes or pari passu to the Notes, in each case

<<<

 as regards the right to receive periodic payments (to the extent any such periodic payment has not been cancelled) on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital on a liquidation or bankruptcy of

<<<

 the Issuer. In the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer will be required to pay its depositors, its unsubordinated creditors and its other subordinated creditors other than the present or future claims of creditors

<<<

 that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes in full before it can make any payments on the Notes. If this occurs, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining after these payments are made to pay amounts due

<<<

 under the Notes.
Loss absorption following a Trigger Event
The Notes are being issued for regulatory capital adequacy purposes with the intention and purpose of being eligible as Additional Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer and the Group. Such eligibility

<<<

 depends upon a number of conditions being satisfied, which are reflected in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and which, in particular, require the Notes and the proceeds of their issue to be available to absorb any losses of the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Group.
Accordingly, if at any time the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group has fallen below 7.000 per cent., the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall be reduced as described in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption

<<<

 Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes).
Holders may lose all or some of their investment as a result of such a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts. Any such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall

<<<

 not constitute an Enforcement Event and, following such reduction, Holders' claims in respect of principal will, in all cases, be based on the reduced Outstanding Principal Amounts to the extent the Outstanding Principal Amounts have not subsequently

<<<

 been reinstated as described in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes).
13

In addition, following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest can only continue

<<<

 to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amounts following such reduction, which will be lower than the Original Principal Amount of the Notes.
Following any such reduction, the Issuer will not in any circumstances be obliged to reinstate the

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amounts, but any reinstatement must be undertaken, subject to compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions, on a pro-rata basis with all other Discretionary Temporary Loss Absorption Instruments (if any) which would

<<<

, following such reinstatement, constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital.
The market price of the Notes is expected to be affected by fluctuations in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group. Any indication that the

<<<

 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group is trending towards 7.000 per cent. may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. The level of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the

<<<

 Group may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes.
Investors should note that, while such a reduction is not common, it is an appreciable risk and is not limited to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Danish resolution

<<<

 regimes
In Denmark, certain schemes were introduced in recent years to facilitate the orderly resolution of distressed banking institutions. The current Danish banking schemes do not contain any provisions that contemplate a statutory write

<<<

 down (or other similar impairment) of subordinated bank liabilities such as the Notes. The schemes, however, allow, inter alia, the Danish government to establish a new bank to take over all the assets and liabilities after the initial haircut

<<<

, if applicable, from failing banks, excluding the failing bank's equity and subordinated capital (such as the Notes), before initiating bankruptcy proceedings against the failing bank. If the Issuer were to become subject to a resolution regime

<<<

 pursuant to such schemes, the Holders may lose some or all of their investment in the Notes. See "Bank Packages" in "Description of the Saxo Bank Group" below for a further description of these schemes. It should also be noted that it is currently

<<<

 unclear whether one or more of these schemes will be replaced (in whole or in part) by the proposals outlined in the draft BRRD (see also "Resolution tools and powers under the BRRD" risk factor below) and SRM (see also "The Group may have

<<<

 to pay additional amounts under deposit guarantee schemes or resolution funds" section above). However, on 6 October 2014, public consultation of a bill proposed by the Danish Government implementing the BRRD, commenced. The proposed bill includes

<<<

 new measures for resolution authorities including the capacity to write down subordinated liabilities such as the Notes. The proposed effective date of the draft legislation is 1 June 2015.
Resolution tools and powers under the BRRD
On 2 July

<<<

 2014, Directive 2014/59/EU providing for the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the "BRRD") entered into force. The BRRD is designed to provide authorities with

<<<

 a credible set of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in an unsound or failing institution so as to ensure the continuity of the institution's critical financial and economic functions, while minimising the impact of the institution

<<<

's failure on the economy and financial system.
The BRRD provides that it will be applied by Member States from 1 January 2015, expect for the general bail-in tool (see below) which is to be applied from 1 January 2016.
The BRRD contains four

<<<

 resolution tools and powers which may be used alone or in combination where the relevant resolution authority considers that (a) an institution is failing or likely to fail, (b) there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector

<<<

 measures would prevent the failure of such institution within a reasonable timeframe, and (c) a resolution action is in the public interest: (i) sale of business - which enables resolution authorities to direct the sale of the firm or the whole

<<<

 or part of its business on commercial terms; (ii) bridge institution - which enables resolution authorities to transfer all or part of the business of the firm to a "bridge institution" (an entity created for this purpose that is wholly or

<<<

 partially in public control); (iii) asset
14

separation - which enables resolution authorities to transfer impaired or problem assets to one or more publicly owned asset management vehicles to allow them to be managed with a view to maximising

<<<

 their value through eventual sale or orderly wind-down (this can be used together with another resolution tool only); and (iv) bail-in which gives resolution authorities the power to write down certain claims of unsecured creditors of a failing

<<<

 institution and to convert certain unsecured debt claims including the Notes to equity (the "general bail-in tool"), which equity could also be subject to any future application of the general bail-in tool.
The BRRD also provides for a Member

<<<

 State as a last resort, after having assessed and exploited the above resolution tools to the maximum extent possible whilst maintaining financial stability, to be able to provide extraordinary public financial support through additional financial

<<<

 stabilisation tools. These consist of the public equity support and temporary public ownership tools. Any such extraordinary financial support must be provided in accordance with the EU state aid framework.
An institution will be considered

<<<

 as failing or likely to fail when: it is, or is likely in the near future to be, in breach of its requirements for continuing authorisation; its assets are, or are likely in the near future to be, less than its liabilities; it is, or is likely

<<<

 in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or it requires extraordinary public financial support (except in limited circumstances).
In addition to the general bail-in tool, the BRRD provides for resolution authorities

<<<

 to have the further power to permanently write-down or convert into equity capital instruments such as the Notes at the point of non-viability and before any other resolution action is taken ("non-viability loss absorption"). Any shares issued

<<<

 to holders of the Notes upon any such conversion into equity may also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool.
For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point of non-viability under

<<<

 the BRRD is the point at which the relevant authority determines that the institution meets the conditions for resolution (but no resolution action has yet been taken) or that the institution will no longer be viable unless the relevant capital

<<<

 instruments (such as the Notes) are written-down or converted or extraordinary public support is to be provided and without such support the appropriate authority determines that the institution would no longer be viable.
The powers set out

<<<

 in the BRRD will impact how credit institutions and investment firms are managed as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors. Once the BRRD is implemented, the Holders may be subject to write-down or conversion into equity

<<<

 on any application of the general bail-in tool and non-viability loss absorption, which may result in such holders losing some or all of their investment. The exercise of any power under the BRRD or any suggestion of such exercise could, therefore

<<<

, materially adversely affect the rights of Holders, the price or value of their investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.
No scheduled redemption
The Notes are perpetual securities

<<<

 and have no fixed date for redemption. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Notes at any time (except as provided in Condition 8 (Redemption and Purchase) and, in any such case, subject always to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption

<<<

 etc.)). There will be no redemption at the option of the Holders.
Cancellation of Interest
Subject as provided in Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), any payment of interest in respect of the Notes shall be payable only out of the Issuer's

<<<

 Distributable Items and:
(i) may be cancelled, at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer in its sole discretion; or
(ii) will be mandatorily cancelled to the extent so required by the Relevant Rules, including the applicable

<<<

 criteria for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments.
15

The Relevant Rules currently provide that discretionary payments in respect of certain capital instruments (including payments of interest on the Notes, which would include for the avoidance

<<<

 of doubt, any additional amounts in respect of interest which may be payable under Condition 10 (Taxation)) will be required to be cancelled, in whole or in part, to the extent that:
(i) Distributable Items are insufficient to make the relevant

<<<

 payment(s); or
(ii) the combined buffer requirement is not met and, if the relevant payment(s) were made, the amount of such payment(s) would exceed the Maximum Distributable Amount.
The Issuer also expects to cancel any such discretionary

<<<

 payment to the extent that the Relevant Rules prescribe and/or, as the case may be, the Relevant Regulator requires that the relevant payment(s) shall be cancelled.
The Issuer's Distributable Items will depend to a large extent on the net income

<<<

 earned by the Issuer. The Maximum Distributable Amount is a novel concept, and its determination is subject to considerable uncertainty. As discussed above, the Issuer is entitled to cancel payments of interest in its sole discretion and it

<<<

 is permitted to do so even if it could make such payments without exceeding the limits described in the paragraph immediately above. Notwithstanding the above expectations, payments of interest on the Notes may be cancelled even if holders

<<<

 of the Issuer's shares continue to receive dividends.
Following any cancellation of interest as described above, the right of Holders to receive accrued interest in respect of the relevant Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will

<<<

 have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned

<<<

 for any purpose nor will the non-payment of such interest constitute an Enforcement Event.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest payments will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result

<<<

 of the interest cancellation provision of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive

<<<

 generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition.
Notes subject to optional redemption by the Issuer or upon the occurrence of a Special Event
Subject as provided herein, in particular to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption

<<<

 etc.), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes on the First Call Date or on any Interest Payment Date thereafter at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it

<<<

 has not been cancelled. Subject as aforesaid, upon the occurrence of a Special Event, the Issuer may also, at its option, at any time redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with

<<<

 accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled.
Holders should note that the Issuer may redeem the Notes as described in the previous paragraph even if (i) the Outstanding Principal Amounts have been so reduced and (ii) the principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes has not been fully reinstated to the original principal amount of the Notes.
An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes

<<<

, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.
The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing

<<<

 is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be

<<<

 able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
16

Substitution and variation of the Notes without Holder consent
Subject to Condition

<<<

 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), if a Special Event has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer may, at its option, and without the consent or approval of the Holders, elect either (i) to substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes or

<<<

 (ii) to vary the terms of all (but not some only) of the Notes, so that they become or remain Qualifying Capital Notes.
Save to the extent necessary to ensure they continue to comply with the Relevant Rules in relation to Additional Tier 1

<<<

 Capital, Qualifying Capital Notes are securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer that have, inter alia, terms not materially less favorable to the Holders than the terms of the Notes (provided that the Issuer shall have delivered a certificate

<<<

 to that effect signed by two of its Directors to the Fiscal Agent). See Condition 8.6 (Substitution and variation).
Limited enforcement events
The Notes will contain limited enforcement events relating to:
(i) non-payment by the Issuer of any

<<<

 amounts due under the Notes. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) and subject as provided below, a Holder may institute proceedings in Denmark in order to recover the amounts due from the Issuer

<<<

 to such Holder; and
(ii) the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In such circumstances, as described in more detail in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events), the Notes will become due and payable at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together

<<<

 with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled.
A Holder may not itself file for the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
The calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios will be affected by a number of factors

<<<

, many of which may be outside the Issuer's control
The occurrence of a Trigger Event and, therefore a write-down of the Original Principal Amounts, is inherently unpredictable and depends on a number of factors, many of which may be outside

<<<

 the Issuer's control. Because the Relevant Regulator may require the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios to be calculated as of any date, a Trigger Event could occur at any time. The calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios of

<<<

 the Issuer and/or the Group could be affected by a wide range of factors, including, among other things, factors affecting the level of the Issuer's and/or the Group's earnings or dividend payments, the mix of businesses, the ability to effectively

<<<

 manage the risk-weighted assets in both the ongoing businesses and those the Issuer and/or the Group may seek to exit, losses in commercial banking, investment banking or other businesses, changes in the Group's structure or organisation, or

<<<

 any of the factors described in "Description of the Saxo Bank Group". The calculation of the ratios also may be affected by changes in applicable accounting rules and the manner in which accounting policies are applied, including the manner

<<<

 in which permitted discretion is under the applicable accounting rules is exercised.
Due to the uncertainty regarding whether a Trigger Event will occur, it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, the Original Principal Amounts may be

<<<

 written down. Accordingly, the trading behaviour of the Notes may not necessarily follow the trading behaviour of other types of subordinated securities. Any indication that the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of either the Issuer or of

<<<

 the Group is approaching the level that would trigger a Trigger Event may have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes. Under such circumstances, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that

<<<

 will provide them with a yield comparable to more conventional investments.
Uncertainties remain regarding the manner in which CRD IV will be interpreted
The defined terms in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes will depend in some cases on

<<<

 the final interpretation of CRD IV. CRD IV is a recently-adopted set of rules and regulations that imposes a series of new requirements,
17

many of which will be phased in over a number of years. Certain portions of the CRD IV Directive required

<<<

 transposition into Danish law, and although the CRD IV Regulation will be directly applicable in each Member State, the CRD IV Regulation leaves a number of important interpretational issues to be resolved through binding technical standards

<<<

 that have been adopted, and will be adopted in the future, and leaves certain other matters to the discretion of the Relevant Regulator. The manner in which the framework and requirements under CRD IV will be applied to the Issuer and the Group

<<<

 remains uncertain.
The determination of the Maximum Distributable Amount is particularly complex. The Maximum Distributable Amount imposes a cap on the Issuer's ability to pay interest on the Notes, and on the Issuer's ability to reinstate

<<<

 the principal amounts of the Notes following a reduction upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event.
Risks related to the Notes generally
Because the Notes are held by or on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to

<<<

 rely on the clearing system procedures for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in the Global

<<<

 Notes, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are in global form, investors will be able to trade

<<<

 their beneficial interests only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.
While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to a common depositary

<<<

. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating

<<<

 to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in such a Global Note.
Meetings of Holders and modification
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Holders to consider matters affecting their

<<<

 interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Holders including Holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Holders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
In addition, the Issuer may

<<<

, subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), make any modification to the Notes, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the Agency Agreement and/or the Deed of Covenant which is not prejudicial to the interests of the Holders

<<<

 without the consent of the Holders. Any such modification shall be binding on the Holders.
Change of Law
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes will be governed by the laws of England, except for Condition 4 (Status of the Notes), Condition

<<<

 6 (Interest Cancellation), Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), Condition 8.2 (Early redemption upon the occurrence of a Special Event), and Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) which shall be

<<<

 governed by, and construed in accordance with, Danish law. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of England or Denmark or administrative practice after the date of this Offering Memorandum

<<<

.
Withholding under the EU Savings Directive
Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest or

<<<

 similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State.
18

On 24 March 201

<<<

4, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the

<<<

 range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member

<<<

 State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or

<<<

 arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.
For a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to

<<<

 such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which still operate a withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favour of automatic information exchange

<<<

 under the Directive.
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland

<<<

 have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act withholding may affect payments on the Notes
Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within Euroclear Bank SA/NV or

<<<

 Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (together the "ICSDs"), in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that the new reporting regime and potential withholding tax imposed by sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal

<<<

 Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") will affect the amount of any payment received by the ICSDs (see "Taxation ­ Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act."). However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment

<<<

 chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial institution that is not

<<<

 entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents

<<<

 that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide

<<<

 each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. Investors should consult their own tax adviser

<<<

 to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are discharged once it has paid the common depositary for the ICSDs (as bearer of the Notes) and the Issuer has therefore

<<<

 no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the ICSDs and custodians or intermediaries.
Notes where denominations involve integral multiples: Definitive Notes
The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum denomination

<<<

 of EUR 200,000 plus one or more higher integral multiples of EUR 1,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples of EUR 200,000. In such a case a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts

<<<

, holds an amount which is less than EUR 200,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the remainder of such holding without first purchasing a principal amount of the Notes at or in excess of EUR 200,00

<<<

0 such that its holding amounts to EUR 200,000 or above. Further, a Holder who, as a result of trading such amount, holds an amount which is less than EUR 200,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not

<<<

 receive a Definitive Note in respect of such holding (should Definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of the Notes at or in excess of EUR 200,000 such that its holding amounts to a denomination.
If Definitive

<<<

 Notes are issued, Holders should be aware that Definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of EUR 200,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.

<<<

 (free of charge to the bearer) of the Permanent Global Note, duly authenticated, to the bearer of the Temporary Global Note or (in the case of any subsequent exchange of a part of the Temporary Global Note) an increase in the principal amount

<<<

<<<

<<<

 at the request of the bearer of the Permanent Global Note, for Definitive Notes, if:

<<<

 by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or in fact does so; or
(ii) any of the circumstances described in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) occurs.
Interests in the Permanent Global Note will also

<<<

 become exchangeable, in whole but not in part only and at the request of the Issuer, for Definitive Notes if, by reason of any change in the laws of Denmark, the Issuer will be required to make any withholding or deduction from any payment

<<<

 in respect of the Notes which would not be required if the Notes are in definitive form.

<<<

<<<

 not been delivered in accordance with the terms of the Permanent Global Note by 6.00 p.m. (London time) on the thirtieth day after the day on which such Permanent Global Note becomes due to be exchanged; or
(ii) if the Permanent Global Note

<<<

 (or any part thereof) becomes due and payable in accordance with the Terms and Conditions or the date for final redemption of the Permanent Global Note has occurred, and, in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due

<<<

 with all accrued interest thereon has not been made on the due date for payment by 6.00 p.m. (London time) on such due date,

<<<

Status of the Notes

The Notes (in Danish: "kapitalbeviser") will be eligible to constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer under CRD IV.

Subject to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following

<<<

 a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), the Notes constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, and will at all times rank:

(i) pari passu without any preference among themselves;

(ii) pari passu with

<<<

 (a) any obligations or capital instruments of the Issuer which constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital and (b) any other obligations or capital instruments that rank or are expressed to rank equally with the Notes, in each case as regards the

<<<

 right to receive periodic payments (to the extent any such periodic payment has not been cancelled) on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer;

<<<

<<<

 Event notice has been given, prior to or after the occurrence of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.

The Notes may be subject to Danish statutory provisions as applicable from time to time that could lead to the write down and/or conversion

<<<

 of the Outstanding Principal Amount (and any accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled) of the Notes to common equity tier 1 instruments of the Issuer, as further described in "Risk Factors ­ Resolution tools and powers

<<<

 under the BRRD".

5.

Interest

5.1 Interest rate: The Notes bear interest on their Outstanding Principal Amounts at the relevant Rate of Interest from (and including) the Issue Date. Interest shall be payable semi-annually in arrear on each

<<<

 Interest Payment Date, subject in any case as provided in Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 9 (Payments). The first payment of interest will be made on 26 February 2015 in respect of the Short First Interest Period.

5.2 Accrual

<<<

 of interest: Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount in respect thereof is improperly withheld or refused, in which case it will continue

<<<

 to bear interest in accordance with this Condition (as well after as before judgment) until whichever is the earlier of:

(i) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant

<<<

 Holder; and

35

(ii) the day which is seven days after the Fiscal Agent has notified the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) that it has received all sums due in respect of the Notes up to such seventh day (except to the extent

<<<

 that there is any subsequent default in payment).
5.3 Interest to (but excluding) the First Call Date: Unless the Calculation Amount has been adjusted as described in the definition thereof, the amount of interest per Calculation Amount payable

<<<

 on:
(i) each Interest Payment Date in relation to an Interest Period falling in the Initial Period (other than the Short First Interest Period) will be EUR 48.75; and
(ii) the First Interest Payment Date will be EUR 24.38.
If the Calculation

<<<

 Amount has been adjusted as described in the definition thereof, Condition 5.7 (Calculation of amount of interest per Calculation Amount) will apply.
5.4 Interest from (and including) the First Call Date: The rate of interest for each Interest

<<<

 Period from (and including) the First Call Date will be equal to the sum of (i) the Reference Rate in respect of the Reset Interest Period in which such Interest Period falls and (ii) the Margin, all as determined by the Fiscal Agent.
5.5 Determination

<<<

 of Reference Rate in relation to a Reset Interest Period: The Fiscal Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Reference Rate Determination Date in relation to a Reset Interest Period, determine the Reference

<<<

 Rate for such Reset Interest Period and calculate the amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on the Interest Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period (each a "Reset Interest Amount"

<<<

).
5.6 Publication of Reference Rate and Reset Interest Amount: With respect to each Reset Interest Period, the Fiscal Agent will cause the relevant Reference Rate and the relevant Reset Interest Amount determined by it, together with the relevant

<<<

 Interest Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period, to be notified to the Paying Agents and each listing authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system (if any) by which the Notes have then been

<<<

 admitted to listing, trading and/or quotation as soon as practicable after such determination but in any event not later than the relevant Reset Date. Notice thereof shall also promptly be given to the Holders in accordance with Condition 

<<<

16 (Notices).
5.7 Calculation of amount of interest per Calculation Amount: Save as specified in Condition 5.3 (Interest to (but excluding) the First Call Date), the amount of interest payable in respect of the Calculation Amount (including

<<<

, for the avoidance of doubt, the Reset Interest Amount) for any period shall be calculated by:
(i) applying the applicable Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount;
(ii) multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction; and
(iii

<<<

) rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being rounded upwards).
If pursuant to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) or as otherwise required by then current legislation

<<<

 and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer, the Outstanding Principal Amounts are reduced and/or reinstated during an Interest Period, the Calculation Amount will be adjusted by the Fiscal Agent to reflect such Outstanding Principal Amounts

<<<

 from time to time so that the relevant amount of interest is determined by reference to such Calculation Amount as adjusted from time to time, all as determined by the Fiscal Agent.
5.8 Calculation of amount of interest per Note: The amount

<<<

 of interest payable in respect of a Note shall be the product of:
(i) the amount of interest per Calculation Amount; and
36

(ii) the number by which the Original Calculation Amount is required to be multiplied to equal the denomination of

<<<

 such Note.

5.9 Notifications etc: All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of this Condition 5 by the Fiscal Agent will (in the absence

<<<

 of manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Paying Agents, the Holders and the Couponholders and (subject as aforesaid) no liability to any such Person will attach to the Fiscal Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by

<<<

 it of its powers, duties and discretions for such purposes.

6.

Interest Cancellation

6.1 Interest Cancellation: Any payment of interest in respect of the Notes shall be payable only out of the Issuer's Distributable Items and:

(i) may be

<<<

 cancelled, at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer in its sole discretion; or

(ii) will be mandatorily cancelled to the extent so required by the Relevant Rules, including the applicable criteria for Additional Tier 

<<<

1 Capital instruments.

6.2 Notice of Interest Cancellation: The Issuer shall give notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) of any such cancellation of a payment of interest, which notice might be given after the date

<<<

 on which the relevant payment of interest is scheduled to be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the right of the Issuer not to pay interest as described above.

6.3 Effect of Interest Cancellation

<<<

: Following any cancellation of interest as described above, the right of Holders to receive accrued interest in respect of any such Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay

<<<

 interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned for any purpose nor will the non-payment of such interest

<<<

 constitute an Enforcement Event.

7.

Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes

7.1 Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event: If at any time a Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer shall immediately notify the Relevant

<<<

 Regulator and, in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices), the Holders and the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall be reduced as described below.

Such reduction shall take place on such date selected by the Issuer in consultation with the Relevant

<<<

 Regulator (the "Write Down Date") but no later than one month following the occurrence of the relevant Trigger Event.

The amount of the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts on the Write Down Date will be equal to the lower of:



<<<

(i) the amount of a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts that would restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, to at least the Trigger Event Threshold at the point of such reduction

<<<

, taking into account:

(A) first, the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (if any) of the Issuer and/or the Group, as the case may be, generated on or prior to the Write Down Date by all Higher Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any

<<<

) outstanding at such time; and

(B) second, the pro-rata reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of all Parity Trigger Loss

37

Absorbing Instruments (if any

<<<

) outstanding at such time with such proration based on the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (if any) of the Issuer and/or the Group, as the case may be, generated on or prior to the Write Down Date by all Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing

<<<

 Instruments (if any) outstanding at such time,
in each case, in accordance with the terms of the relevant instruments and the Relevant Rules and provided that:
(x) to the extent the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common

<<<

 Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Higher Trigger Loss Absorbing Instrument or Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instrument is not, or by the relevant Write Down Date will not be, effective for any reason:
(1) the

<<<

 ineffectiveness of any such reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments shall not prejudice the requirement to effect a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this condition

<<<

; and
(2) the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Higher Trigger Loss Absorbing Instrument which is not, or by the Write Down Date will not be, effective

<<<

 shall not be taken into account in determining such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts; and
(y) each of provision (A) and/or (B) above shall be disapplied to the extent the existence of such provision(s) would cause the occurrence

<<<

 of a Capital Event
and
(ii) the amount of a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts that would reduce the Outstanding Principal Amounts to EUR 0.01.
Notwithstanding that the principal amount of certain Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments

<<<

 may be reduced (on a temporary or permanent basis in accordance with their terms) or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments in full, the Issuer will first procure, to the extent possible, that the Outstanding Principal Amount

<<<

 of any Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments is, or has been, reduced or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments (in accordance with its terms) on a pro-rata basis with the Outstanding Principal Amounts.
Following a reduction

<<<

 of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest will continue to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amounts following such reduction, and will be subject to Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 7.2 (Reinstatement

<<<

 of the Notes) as described herein.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note shall, upon the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts described above, be reduced on a likewise pro-rata basis.
Any reduction

<<<

 of the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) shall not constitute an Enforcement Event.
7.2 Reinstatement of the Notes: Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts

<<<

 in accordance with Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event), the Issuer may, at its discretion, reinstate some or all of the principal amount of the Notes, subject to compliance with the Relevant Rules (including the Maximum

<<<

 Distributable Amount (if any) and, for such purpose, the amount of such reinstatement shall be aggregated together with other distributions of the Issuer or the Group of the kind referred to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive or, if

<<<

 different, any provision of
38

Danish law implementing Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive), on a pro-rata basis with all other Discretionary Temporary Loss Absorption Instruments (if any) which would, following such reinstatement, constitute

<<<

 Additional Tier 1 Capital.

For the avoidance of doubt, at no time may the Outstanding Principal Amounts exceed the Original Principal Amount of the Notes.

To the extent that the principal amount of the Notes has been reinstated as described

<<<

 above, interest shall begin to accrue on the reinstated principal amount of the Notes, and become payable in accordance with these Conditions, as from the date of the relevant reinstatement.

Unless the Relevant Rules provide otherwise, a reinstatement

<<<

 of the principal amount of the Notes pursuant to this Condition 7.2 will not be effected at any time in circumstances where the sum of:

(i) the aggregate amount of the principal of the Notes to be so reinstated; and

(ii) the aggregate amount

<<<

 of any interest on the Notes that was paid or calculated (but disregarding any such calculated interest which has been cancelled) on the basis of an Outstanding Principal Amount that is lower than the Original Principal Amount of the Notes

<<<

 at any time after the end of the then previous financial year,

would exceed the Maximum Reinstatement Amount.

<<<

 of the Notes, without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Holders, so that they become or remain Qualifying Capital Notes.
Any such notice shall specify the relevant details of the manner in which such substitution or variation

<<<

 shall take effect and where the Holders can inspect or obtain copies of the new terms and conditions of the Qualifying Capital Notes. Such substitution or variation will be effected without any cost or charge to the Holders.

 another Paying Agent in a Member State of the European Union.
10.2 Taxing jurisdiction: If the Issuer becomes subject at any time to any taxing jurisdiction other than Denmark, references in these Conditions to Denmark shall be construed as

<<<

 references to Denmark and/or such other jurisdiction.
11. Enforcement Events
The following events or circumstances (each an "Enforcement Event") shall be enforcement events:
(i) subject to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event

<<<

 and Reinstatement of the Notes) and Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), if the Issuer shall fail to meet its payment obligations under the Notes and such payment obligations are not met within seven Business Days after the Issuer has received

<<<

 notice thereof, any Holder may, at its own discretion and without further notice, institute proceedings in Denmark in order to recover the amounts due from the Issuer to such Holder, provided that a Holder may not at any time file for liquidation

<<<

 or bankruptcy of the Issuer. Any Holder may, at its discretion and without further notice, institute such proceedings against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce any obligation, condition or provision binding on the Issuer under the Notes

<<<

, provided that the Issuer shall not by virtue of the institution of any proceedings be obliged to pay any sum or sums sooner than the same would otherwise have been payable by it; and
(ii) if an order is made or an effective resolution is passed

<<<

<<<

 to meet such obligations may be considered to be temporary.

<<<

 to the Issuer in Denmark. In addition, to the extent that the Holders are entitled to any recovery with respect to the Notes in any such Danish bankruptcy proceedings, such Holders would be entitled to a recovery in Danish Kroner or, as the

<<<

 case may be, other currencies, which would be based on the relevant conversion rate in effect on the date the Issuer entered into such liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings.

<<<

 relevant Notes are presented for payment within ten years of the appropriate Relevant Date. Claims for interest shall become void unless the relevant Coupons are presented for payment within five years of the appropriate Relevant Date.

<<<

(i) any modification to the Notes, these Conditions, the Agency Agreement and

<<<

/or the Deed of Covenant to correct a manifest error; or

<<<

, these Conditions, the Agency Agreement or the Deed of Covenant except with the sanction of an Extraordinary Resolution and, in the case of a modification to the Agency Agreement, the consent of the Fiscal Agent.
Any such modification shall

<<<

 be binding on the Holders and the Couponholders and any such modification shall be notified to the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) as soon as practicable thereafter.
16. Notices
Notices to Holders will be deemed to be validly

<<<

 given if published in a leading English language daily newspaper having general circulation in Europe or, if the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of the

<<<

 Irish Stock Exchange (so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange so permit), if published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

<<<

 that notices are duly published in a manner which complies with the rules of any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are for the time being listed or by which they have been admitted to trading.

<<<

44

been made in all the required newspapers). Couponholders

<<<

 will be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the Holders in accordance with this Condition.
Notwithstanding Condition 16 (Notices), while all the Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and

<<<

 such Global Note(s) are held in their entirety on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system, the requirement for a notice to be published in a leading English language daily newspaper having

<<<

 general circulation in Europe shall not apply and notices to Holders may instead be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system for communication by them to

<<<

 the persons shown in their respective records as having interests therein and, in any case, such notices shall be deemed to have been given to the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) on the date of delivery to Euroclear and/or

<<<

 Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system.
17. Currency Indemnity
The currency in which the Notes are denominated is euro (the "Contractual Currency"), which is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable

<<<

 by the Issuer in respect of the Notes, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Contractual Currency (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction

<<<

 or otherwise) by any Holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer shall only constitute a discharge to the Issuer to the extent of the amount of the Contractual Currency which such Holder is able to purchase with the

<<<

 amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If that amount is less

<<<

 than the amount of the Contractual Currency expressed to be due to any Holder in respect of such Note or Coupon the Issuer shall indemnify such Holder against any loss sustained by such Holder as a result. In any event, the Issuer shall indemnify

<<<

 each such Holder against any cost of making such purchase which is reasonably incurred. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's other obligations, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause

<<<

 of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder and shall continue in full force and effect despite any judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due in respect of the Notes or

<<<

 any judgment or order. Any such loss as aforesaid shall be deemed to constitute a loss suffered by the relevant Holder and no proof or evidence of any actual loss will be required by the Issuer.
18. Waiver and Remedies
No failure to exercise

<<<

, and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Holder, any right in these Conditions shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other

<<<

 right. Rights hereunder shall be in addition to all other rights provided by law. No notice or demand given in any case shall constitute a waiver of rights to take other action in the same, similar or other instances without such notice or

<<<

 demand.

<<<

 a result, nothing in this Condition 19 prevents any Holder from taking proceedings relating to a Dispute ("Proceedings") in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the extent allowed by law, any Holder may take concurrent Proceedings in any

<<<

 number of jurisdictions.

<<<

 any term or Condition in respect of a Note under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

48

an international client base from

<<<

 its headquarters in Copenhagen and a growing network of offices across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Australia. For more information on the Group structure please refer to the section "Group Structure" below. Saxo Bank's

<<<

 platform has evolved to meet the changing needs of traders and investors, winning an array of awards along the way, and Saxo Bank now offers a full suite of platforms utilising web and mobile technologies. The awards and recognitions that Saxo

<<<

<<<

 market. As of 30 June 2014 the Group consists of 26 offices/branches/subsidiaries in 25 countries.
49

Financial Highlights
The Issuer's Business Model Saxo Bank's business model is that of a facilitator. Saxo Bank offers access to products

<<<

 and services provided by third parties through its online trading platforms. These are SaxoWebTrader, SaxoTrader and SaxoTrader Mobile App. Saxo Bank's business model relies to a certain extent on brokers and financial institutions that have

<<<

 a direct relationship with the client, as they delegate the work of the operation and trade execution to Saxo Bank. In Denmark, Saxo Bank also offers retail banking services and professional portfolio and fund management through its subsidiary

<<<

 Saxo Privatbank A/S. Saxo Bank's focus has, over the years, expanded from private clients to include financial institutions such as hedge funds, asset managers and corporates, for whom Saxo Bank has developed dedicated solutions and service

<<<

 models. Trading facilitation Liquidity provision To facilitate online margin trading in non-listed products on its trading platforms, Saxo Bank obtains liquidity from more than 15 large banks. For trading in listed stocks, liquidity is provided

<<<

 through links to the world's main stock exchanges. By aggregating the liquidity of its liquidity providers, Saxo Bank is able to stream competitive prices and spreads to its clients, and to deal with the flow of transactions in a costeffective

<<<

 way. As Saxo Bank services thousands of clients simultaneously, Saxo Bank is often able to match the trade of its client with an opposite trade in the same instrument by another client, thereby eliminating the
50

need for, and cost of external

<<<

 hedging of, the exposure created by the initial trade. Cost-effective flow handling and risk management are thus core competences of Saxo Bank.
Products
Saxo Bank offers a wide range of assets and products for online trading, including, among

<<<

 others, Foreign Exchange ("FX"), equities, commodities (including energy and precious metals) and Exchange Traded Funds ("ETFs"). The FX product range comprises spot FX, forwards, options, binary touch options and Contracts for Difference 

<<<

("CFDs") on FX. Equities are traded in the form of cash stocks, CFDs on single stocks, CFDs on stock indices, exchange traded contract options, ETFs and Exchange Traded Commodities ("ETCs"). Commodities are traded in the form of futures, CFDs

<<<

, contract options and OTC options on precious metals.
Clients are able to trade 179 currency crosses, over 9,000 CFDs, more than 19,000 listed stocks from exchanges around the world, futures, FX options, contract options, ETFs and ETCs.
Margin

<<<

 trading and risk management
FX, CFDs and futures are typically traded on margin, meaning that clients are enabled to enter into nominal investments/positions that exceed the value of their deposits with Saxo Bank. To facilitate clients' trading

<<<

 in margin products, Saxo Bank allows clients to use cash deposits, stocks and bonds as collateral. The risk involved with margin trading on the basis of financial collateral is managed in real-time by use of Saxo Bank's proprietary risk-management

<<<

 systems ­ reference is made to the section below "Risk Management ­ Risk Management Systems".
Trading platforms
To facilitate its clients' trading needs and preferences, Saxo Bank has developed a range of proprietary online trading platforms

<<<

, tailored to fit different client preferences and different types of hardware and technologies. These versions include the downloadable SaxoTrader, which is the most-used by clients, the web-based Saxo-WebTrader and the SaxoTrader mobile apps

<<<

 accessible by iPhones, iPads and Android phones and tablets. Saxo Bank also supports offline trading in a wide range of fixed income products, including sovereign bonds, government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage bonds.
In addition to prices

<<<

 and spreads, the trading platforms provide clients with access to real-time market news and analysis from recognised newswires such as Dow Jones, Newswires, Reuters etc. Clients also have access to real-time charts, financial calendars, risk

<<<

 management tools, educational resources and other tools.
An advanced Application Programming Interface ("API")-based trading solution is also offered, branded as Saxo Direct. The API solution provides access to Saxo Bank's own multi-asset liquidity

<<<

. This trading access is suited to retail aggregators and asset managers who can benefit from competitive spreads on a range of assets, including FX, CFDs (Indices and Commodities), CFD Direct Market Access ("DMA") , stocks and futures.
Trading

<<<

 is also facilitated through the MT4 trading platform developed by MetaQuotes, which is considered particularly useful for clients who focus on algorithmic trading through Expert Advisors.
TradingFloor.com
In addition to its trading platforms

<<<

, Saxo Bank has developed TradingFloor.com, a platform designed to facilitate Saxo Bank's digital interaction with its clients, with a great variety of value-adding content, including Saxo TV, education material, news and analyses.
TradingFloor

<<<

.com is also the home of a community of traders and investors as well as Saxo Bank's offering of social trading features. This will, in Q4 2014, allow clients to follow and copy the trades of other clients
51

and at a later stage Saxo Bank

<<<

 expects to add the ability to set up the platform to automatically execute the same transactions as professional clients.
Clients
Private clients
The majority of Saxo Bank's direct clients are private individuals. These clients represent a

<<<

 broad range of individuals with varying degrees of financial experience, insight, wealth and motivation for trading.
To ensure that Saxo Bank provides a suitable offering in terms of prices and service in relation to each private client, Saxo

<<<

 Bank has implemented a client service concept with varying service offerings and price conditions, based on the overall value of the relationship with each client.
Institutional clients
Saxo Bank serves five key institutional client segments

<<<

, including white labels, asset managers, introducing brokers, financial institutions and API clients via Saxo Direct.
Saxo Bank's trading platform is built with advanced functionality and institutional-grade capabilities suited for the hedging

<<<

 and proprietary trading needs of corporations, banks and broker-dealers.
Saxo Bank enables asset managers and introducing brokers to manage their trading activities with clients on Saxo Bank's online platform.
White Label clients
In addition

<<<

 to direct private clients, Saxo Bank also provides trading services to clients of other banks and brokers who offer rebranded versions of Saxo Bank's trading platform to their underlying clients and in their own name. Such banks and brokers

<<<

, referred to as white label clients, represent approximately half of all clients on-boarded by Saxo Bank. Under the white label concept, Saxo Bank handles the operation, posttrade processing, online risk management and the entire back-end system

<<<

, thereby enabling the white label customer to focus on client service and acquisition.
Saxo Privatbank A/S
In addition to offering the full package of Saxo Bank's global products and services, Saxo Privatbank A/S focuses on the development

<<<

 of traditional banking and pension products for the Danish market with the emphasis on advanced investment solutions. With the addition of Saxo Wealth Management (previously Sirius Asset Management), the focus on the top segment of investors

<<<

, defined as High Net Worth individuals and institutional investors, has been further strengthened.
Shareholders' equity
Saxo Bank's authorised and issued share capital is DKK 66,618,481.00 as at 24 November 2014.
The Issuer is privately owned

<<<

 with three parties having close to 90% of the issued share capital, the remaining 10% being owned by more than 400 minority shareholders, including former and current employees. According to the Danish Companies Act, shareholders must notify

<<<

 a company if their shareholding exceeds 5 per cent. of the company's share capital. Three shareholders have notified the Issuer that they hold or represent more than 5 per cent. of its share capital:

 TPG Merl Sarl, L-2453, Luxembourg. Capital and Solvency
Risk Management Group Risk Management Saxo Bank Group´s overall risk framework is established by the Board

<<<

 of Directors and is based on recommendations from the Board - appointed Board Risk Committee. Saxo Bank's risk management framework is contained in various instructions and policies that set the limits of Saxo Bank's risk taking activities

<<<

 (the "Board Instructions"). The Board Instructions specifically determine Saxo Bank's risk appetite on credit, market, operational, liquidity and business risks. This appetite is delegated to the Executive Board via specific limits where applicable

<<<

. In addition, the Board has issued a market risk policy, which establishes guidelines for market exposure and a credit risk policy, which establishes guidelines for managing counterparties and credit limits. The Executive Board applies the

<<<

 Board Instructions through the implementation of a risk management framework, governed by the Management Risk Committee. The Risk Director has overall responsibility for implementing the risk management framework, including risk oversight,

<<<

 assurance approaches, models and reports. The on-going monitoring and controlling of risks is also delegated to the Risk Director and is centralised in the Risk Management Department. In addition, the Risk Management Department is responsible

<<<

 for monitoring the documentation of key activities. Saxo Bank applies the principle of three lines of defence to establish a sound risk management practice within the organization. Each line of business (first line) carries out several first

<<<

 level controls which are monitored, reviewed and challenged by risk management and compliance (second line). Both internal and external audit managers carry out scheduled audits to validate first and second line controls (third line). Throughout

<<<

 the year, the Board of Directors is kept informed about Saxo Bank's overall risk exposures and limit utilisation, and receives the Risk Director's annual Risk Report. Risk Management Systems
53

The risk management function uses several systems

<<<

 and solutions, including statistical databases, Saxo Bank systems and other proprietary solutions to cover assessment, control and reporting requirements.
Group Legal and Compliance
Saxo Bank's Legal and Compliance Department is headed by a

<<<

 Group General Counsel, who is responsible for all legal and compliance matters, including legal risk management across the Group. The Legal and Compliance Department is staffed with experienced resources for each function.
Given the global

<<<

 nature of Saxo Bank's activities the centralised function is assisted by local legal and compliance resources in each region, and external counsel where necessary.
On-boarding of Clients
Client on-boarding is a critical function for Saxo Bank

<<<

 before it initiates a relationship with a client. The onboarding process is under supervision of the Group's Legal and Compliance Department and involves amongst other things Know-Your-Customer and Anti­Money Laundering due diligence processes

<<<

 in order to comply with applicable legislation in this respect. In addition, the Group has a wide range of compliance programs and surveillance systems for the monitoring of its day-to-day activities.
Legal proceedings
Owing to its business

<<<

 volume, the Group is from time to time a party to various lawsuits and disputes and has an ongoing dialogue with public authorities such as the DFSA. In view of its size, the Group does not expect the outcome of pending lawsuits and disputes

<<<

 or its dialogue with public authorities to have any material effect on its financial position.
Bank Packages
With effect from 1 October 2010 the Act on Financial Stability (Chapter 4a of the Danish Act No. 1003 of 10 October 2008 on Financial

<<<

 Stability, as amended by Consolidated Act No. 875 of 15 September 2009, Act No. 516 of 12 June 2009, Act No. 1273 of 16 December 2009, Act No. 721 of 25 June 2010, Act No. 1556 of 21 December 2010 and Act No. 619 of 14 June 2011, Act No. 2

<<<

73 of 27 March 2012, Act No. 1231 of 18 December 2012 and Act No. 1287 of 19 December 2012, and as further amended from time to time (the "Act on Financial Stability")) was amended inter alia to allow for a controlled winding-up of a distressed

<<<

 bank through the Financial Stability Company which is known as "Bank Package III". The resolution scheme is voluntary and contains no general state guarantee of creditors.
The intention of the winding-up procedures is to wind up a distressed

<<<

 bank faster than under the traditional bankruptcy procedures. The procedures do not alter the risk for the creditors, which is that under both the winding-up procedures and the traditional bankruptcy procedures, the creditors may lose all or

<<<

 part of their claims.
The Act on Financial Stability was further amended with effect from 23 June 2011 in order to allow for the Guarantee Fund for Depositors and Investors to contribute with a financial inducement to encourage a sound bank

<<<

 to take over all activities of a distressed bank, including all unsubordinated and unsecured claims. On 25 August 2011 a number of consolidation initiatives were agreed upon by the vast majority of the political parties in the Danish Parliament

<<<

 ("Bank Package IV"). Bank Package IV provides for a strengthening of the compensation scheme in order to create greater incentives for sound banks to wholly or partly take over a bank in distress. In particular, Bank Package IV provides for

<<<

 the Danish State to contribute in the compensation scheme with an amount up to the equivalent of the haircut that would have been imposed on any state guaranteed bonds that were issued by the bank in distress. Contrary to Bank Package III,

<<<

 the unsubordinated and unsecured senior creditors will not suffer any loss if Bank Package IV is applied.
54

New Capital and Liquidity Regulations
New regulations for the financial sector have been implemented in the EU and beyond. The Group

<<<

 has implemented the new regulations from 1 January 2014, subject to certain transitional provisions. The Group has followed this process for new regulations closely and supports measures that strengthen the resilience of the sector and its

<<<

 ability to support economic growth. The Group is of the opinion that the Basel III/CRD IV guidelines (see below) generally meet this criterion.
European implementation of the Basel III Framework
The final versions of the CRR and the CRD IV

<<<

 Directive (for the purposes of this "Description of the Saxo Bank Group" section, in each case as defined in the risk factor on page 11 of this Offering Memorandum headed "The Issuer will face increased capital and liquidity requirements as

<<<

 a result of the new Basel III Framework") were adopted in June 2013. The CRR entered into force on 1 January 2014, and the CRD IV Directive was implemented in Denmark in March 2014. The framework implemented, among other things, Basel III in

<<<

 the EU. Each of the CRR and the CRD IV Directive covers a wide range of prudent requirements for banks across EU member states, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, risk-weighted assets, leverage ratio

<<<

, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements. The CRD IV Directive covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual risk assessment) and other measures such as the combined capital buffer requirements

<<<

, governance and remuneration requirements.
The CRD IV Directive came into force through implementation in the Danish Financial Business Act, whereas the CRR applies immediately without implementation in national law. The phase-in of the capital

<<<

 requirements will follow the path in the CRR until 2018 unless required earlier in applicable Danish legislation. The EBA has proposed and will propose detailed rules through binding technical standards during the period 2014 to 2017 for many

<<<

 areas including, inter alia, liquidity requirements and certain aspects of capital requirements.
Under the CRR and the CRD IV Directive, the capital requirement for common equity tier 1 ("CET1") (which does not include hybrid capital) will

<<<

 be phased in gradually from the current minimum 4 per cent. of risk-weighted assets to up to 9.5 per cent. in 2019. The 9.5 per cent. requirement will include a "capital conservation buffer requirement" of 2.5 per cent. and a "countercyclical

<<<

 buffer requirement" of 0-2.5 per cent. in addition to the minimum requirement of 4.5 per cent.. The countercyclical buffer requirement will apply in periods of excess lending growth in the economy and can vary for each jurisdiction. If a bank

<<<

 does not maintain these buffers (in excess of the 4.5 per cent. CET1 minimum requirement), restrictions will be placed on its ability to pay dividends and make other payments.
The Group estimates that the impact of the CRD IV Directive and

<<<

 the CRR on the CET1 capital ratio will be a further reduction of 1.08 per cent.. This estimate is calculated as if the rules had been fully implemented as at 30 June 2014.
Each of the CRD IV Directive and the CRR includes a requirement for

<<<

 credit institutions to calculate, report and monitor their leverage ratios, defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of total exposure. The leverage ratios will be assessed under Pillar II (as defined in the CRD IV Directive) pending a subsequent

<<<

 political decision in the EU on whether this should be a Pillar I (as defined in the CRD IV Directive). According to the current rules defined in the CRR, the Issuer had a leverage ratio of 7.11 per cent. as at 30 June 2014.
As regards liquidity

<<<

, the EU Commission imposed two liquidity ratios: (i) the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") and the Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"). The LCR stipulates that banks must have a liquidity buffer that ensures a survival horizon of at least 30 calendar

<<<

 days in the case of a seriously stressed liquidity situation. The NSFR is intended to ensure a sound funding structure by promoting an increase in long-dated funding.
55

In January 2013, the Basel Committee issued revisions to its guideline

<<<

 for the LCR and this was implemented in Danish legislation in March 2014. The revisions include a phasing-in of the minimum requirement in which it will be set at 60 per cent. in 2015 and rise in equal annual steps to 100 per cent. in 2018

<<<

. The existing Danish liquidity requirements are presently maintained through the phasing-in period.
In Europe, the focus is on the LCR, but the full definition of the LCR is still awaiting additional delegated legislation from the EU Commission

<<<

 in 2014.
With an LCR of 70.41 per cent. at 30 June 2014, the Group complied with the LCR requirement as defined by the Danish legislation.
Capital Management of the Saxo Bank Group
The purpose of the Saxo Bank Group's capital management practice

<<<

 is to ensure that the Group has sufficient capital at all times to cover the risks associated with its activities. The framework for the Group's capital management is rooted in the CRD IV Directive's Pillars I, II and III. Pillar I contains

<<<

 a set of rules for calculating the minimum capital requirement. Pillar II describes the framework for the Group's Internal Capital adequacy assessment process and the supervisory review, while Pillar III contains the disclosure aspect.
The

<<<

 Group's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") comprises four steps as described below.
Pillar I, Capital requirements
This first step in assessing the Group's adequate capital level is to calculate the minimum capital requirement

<<<

 using the CRD IV, Pillar I. The Group uses the following methods to calculate risk-weighted assets for the three types of risks: credit risk (standard method), market risk (standard method) and operational risk (basic indicator method).
Pillar

<<<

 II, Risk self-assessment using a quantitative approach
The second step is to assess the risks to which the Group is exposed in a quantitative approach. Different risk types are examined and split into major risk categories. Different methods

<<<

 are applied to assess the Group's capital need in each category.
Capital requirement, 8+ methodology
The third step calculates the capital requirement in line with the requirements of the DFSA's capital adequacy requirement guideline (referred

<<<

 to as 8+).
Each defined risk category is examined in order to determine whether additional capital beyond the Pillar I requirement should be set aside, and as determined by the internal Pillar II calculation.
Stress testing using a scenario

<<<

-based approach
The fourth step in the ICAAP estimates the capital and earnings effects of stress test scenarios regardless of the previous capital adequacy levels.
Stress tests are developed on the basis of the risk register. One or more stress

<<<

 scenarios are made in the major categories, consisting of one or more events from the register in the applicable risk category. Furthermore, Saxo Bank Group uses a number of combined stress scenarios, combining multiple events across risk categories

<<<

. One of the combined events entails a close to unlikely chain of events, in order to ensure a high level of stress. Where applicable, the stress test takes insurance coverage into account.
56

The stress scenarios are updated and reviewed

<<<

 according to changes in the market and economic environment, and at least once a year. Capital adequacy determination To determine the appropriate level of capital, the results of the four steps are compared ­ both in nominal terms and as percentages

<<<

. The percentage is determined by using the risk-weighted assets calculated in step one as denominator. This represents the minimum regulatory required 8 per cent. of the risk-weighted assets. The largest percentage is determined and is considered

<<<

 as the minimum capital level within which the Group should operate. Capital planning Part of the ICAAP is planning future capital needs in relation to the business environment, growth and strategic plans in the years to come. Potential major

<<<

 changes to the risk profile, and thereby the future solvency need, are estimated using the ICAAP. This could be changes in the business strategy or competitive landscape, significant increases in traded volumes, fundamental changes in the market

<<<

 conditions, changes in the internal organisation, mergers and acquisitions activity, material changes in regulatory requirements or introductions of new products. This input is used in the strategic decision-making process by the Board of Directors

<<<

 and the Executive Board. Furthermore, the result of the ICAAP is used as input to the capital plan and the capital contingency plan. The capital plan is a function of the estimated (budgeted) forecast of capital, risk and earnings. The capital

<<<

 plan is inter alia based on the CRD IV Directive and the CRR. The result of the ICAAP step three (scenario based approach) is used as input to the capital contingency plan. The financial consequences following the various scenarios and potential

<<<

 management actions are estimated using the methodology described under the ICAAP step two ­ whereby the most likely net financial consequences from a scenario appear. The potential management actions are revised should the estimated net financial

<<<

 consequences bring Saxo Bank Group below the required minimum capital level. A full ICAAP is performed as often as required, but at least once a year. Capital adequacy levels adjusted according to the ongoing limit utilisation are published

<<<

 on a quarterly basis and reported to the DFSA on a monthly basis. Liquidity The Saxo Bank Group is subject to Danish regulatory liquidity requirements. As of 31 December 2013, the regulatory liquidity requirement for the Group was DKK 4.51

<<<

 billion. The Group's liquidity to cover this requirement was DKK 12.50 billion.
57

The CRR implies that future liquidity requirements for a short-term LCR must be set to ensure that institutions always have an adequate holding of liquid assets

<<<

 to cover imbalances arising between incoming and outgoing cash flows in stressful situations over a thirty-day period.
The Saxo Bank Group expects the future CRR regulation to be more restrictive than the current Danish regulation due to expected

<<<

 higher liquidity requirements on investment bank activities which is the Group´s core business. The Group is monitoring the final regulation and interpretations closely and has taken action based on the estimated impact on the future liquidity

<<<

 regulation.
Recent Developments
In March 2014, the DFSA, in light of an incident in Singapore in the fourth quarter of 2013, issued nine executive orders against the Issuer concerning its client risk management processes and, in particular

<<<

, those that relate to white label clients' ("WLCs'") margin trading. The incident was caused by an extraordinarily rapid drop in values of equities which led to unrealised losses on CFD contracts for a group of clients under a WLC. Due to the

<<<

 drop in values, the placed collateral became insufficient. The DFSA assessed that the incident was caused by weaknesses in the Issuer's manual risk management of WLCs' margin trading, including that the Issuer's risk management practices were

<<<

 insufficient at the time. The DFSA later inspected and concluded that the Issuer's calculation of its own solvency capital requirements as of end March 2014 was sufficient in light of the Issuer's risk management of clients' margin trading

<<<

, and noted that the Issuer was in the process of strengthening its general risk management of clients margin trading. The Issuer has committed the necessary resources to address and fulfil the nine executive orders imposed by the DFSA and consider

<<<

 itself to be in compliance with the said executive orders.
The Issuer holds 25% of the issued share capital in Banco Electronico Servico Total, S.A ("BEST"), a Portuguese bank. The remaining 75% share capital was held by Banco Espirito Santo

<<<

 S.A ("BES"), but due to restructuring of BES in September 2014 this 75% share capital of BEST has been transferred to Nuevo Banco S.A., backed by the Portuguese state. Nuevo Banco is currently subject to a pending sales process which could

<<<

 lead to a change of control for BEST. Due to this situation, the uncertainty regarding the value of Saxo Bank's investment in BEST has increased.
Management of Saxo Bank
The Issuer's administrative bodies are the Board of Directors and the

<<<

 Executive Board. The Board of Directors, which consists of non-executive directors, is elected by the shareholders of the Issuer at the annual general meeting. The directors are elected for terms of one year each but are eligible for re-election

<<<

. According to prevailing Danish law the employees of the Saxo Bank Group are entitled to appoint employee representatives to the Board of Directors of Saxo Bank. To date the employees have not exercised this right of appointment.

SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE
The Managers have, pursuant to a Subscription Agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") dated 24 November 2014, jointly

<<<

 and severally agreed to subscribe and pay for the Notes at the issue price of 100.00 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes. The Issuer will pay a commission to the Managers pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. The Issuer will also

<<<

 reimburse the Managers in respect of certain of their expenses, and has agreed to indemnify the Managers against certain liabilities incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes. The Subscription Agreement may be terminated in certain

<<<

 circumstances prior to payment to the Issuer.
United States of America: Regulation S Category 2; TEFRA D
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or

<<<

 to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in the preceding sentence have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold

<<<

 or delivered within the United States or its possessions or to U.S. persons, except in certain transactions permitted by U.S. Treasury regulations. Terms used in the preceding sentence have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue

<<<

 Code of 1986 and Treasury regulations thereunder.
Each Manager has agreed that, except as permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise

<<<

 until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the Issue Date (the "distribution compliance period") within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons and that it will have sent to each distributor

<<<

, dealer or person to which it sells the Notes during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit

<<<

 of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the respective meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.
In addition, until forty days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes, any offer or sale of the

<<<

 Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
United Kingdom
Each Manager has represented and agreed that:
(a) Financial promotion

<<<

: it has only communicated or caused to be communicated, and will only communicate or cause to be communicated, any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets

<<<

 Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 would not, if the Issuer was not an authorised person, apply to the Issuer; and

<<<


(b) General compliance: it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom

<<<

.
Denmark
Each Manager has represented and agreed that it has not offered or sold and will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes directly or indirectly in Denmark by way of a public offering, unless in compliance with the Danish Consolidated

<<<

 Act No. 831 of 12 June 2014 on Trading in Securities, as amended, and any Executive Orders issued thereunder.
61

General No action has been or will be taken in any country or jurisdiction by the Issuer or the Managers that would permit a

<<<

 public offering of the Notes, or possession or distribution of any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Persons into whose hands this Offering Memorandum comes are

<<<

 required by the Issuer and the Managers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in or from which they purchase, offer, sell or deliver the Notes or have in their possession or distribute such offering

<<<

 material, in all cases at their own expense. The Subscription Agreement provides that the Managers shall not be bound by any of the restrictions relating to any specific jurisdiction (set out above) to the extent that such restrictions shall

<<<

, as a result of change(s) or change(s) in official interpretation, after the date hereof, of applicable laws and regulations, no longer be applicable but without prejudice to the obligations of the Managers described in the paragraph headed

TAXATION
The following is a general description of relevant tax considerations and is not to be regarded as a complete tax analysis of all tax issues related to the Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes should consult

<<<

 their professional tax advisers if they are in doubt about their own tax position.
Denmark Taxation
According to the Danish tax laws in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, (i) except as provided below, payments of interest or

<<<

 principal amounts to any holder of a Note are not subject to taxation in Denmark, (ii) no withholding tax should be required on such payments and (iii) any gain realised upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note will not be subject to

<<<

 taxation in Denmark. This tax treatment applies solely to holders of the Notes who are not subject to full tax liability in Denmark or included in a Danish joint taxation scheme or do not carry on business in Denmark through a permanent establishment

<<<

 and that the holder of the Notes is not affiliated with the Issuer (as set out in Section 3B of the Danish Tax Control Act).
EU Savings Directive
Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required

<<<

 to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State

<<<

 or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State.
On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are

<<<

 required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also expand

<<<

 the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts)

<<<

 where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.
For a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are required

<<<

 (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which still operate

<<<

 a withholding system when they are implemented. In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favour of automatic information exchange under the Directive

<<<

.
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted

<<<

 similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Sections 1471 through 1474 of FATCA impose a new reporting regime and potentially a 30 per cent. withholding tax with respect to certain

<<<

 payments to (i) any non-U.S. financial institution (a "foreign financial institution", or "FFI" (as defined by FATCA)) that does not become a "Participating FFI" by entering into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to

<<<

 provide the IRS with certain information in respect of its account holders and investors or is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA and (ii) any investor (unless otherwise exempt from FATCA) that does not provide information

<<<

 sufficient to determine whether the investor is a U.S. person or should otherwise be treated as holding a "United States Account" of the Issuer (a "Recalcitrant Holder"). The Issuer will be classified as an FFI.
The new withholding regime will

<<<

 be phased in beginning 1 July 2014 for payments from sources within the United States and will apply to "foreign passthru payments" (a term not yet defined) no earlier than 1 January
63

2017. This withholding would potentially apply to payments

<<<

 in respect of (i) any Notes characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterized as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued after the "grandfathering date", which is the date on which final U.S

<<<

. Treasury regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are filed with the Federal Register, or which are materially modified on or after the grandfathering date and (ii) any Notes characterised as equity or which do not have a fixed

<<<

 term for U.S. federal tax purposes, whenever issued. If Notes are issued before the grandfathering date, and additional Notes of the same series are issued on or after that date, the additional Notes may not be treated as grandfathered, which

<<<

 may have negative consequences for the existing Notes, including a negative impact on market price.
The United States and a number of other jurisdictions have announced their intention to negotiate intergovernmental agreements to facilitate

<<<

 the implementation of FATCA (each, an "IGA"). Pursuant to FATCA and the "Model 1" and "Model 2" IGAs released by the United States, an FFI in an IGA signatory country could be treated as a "Reporting FI" not subject to withholding under FATCA

<<<

 on any payments it receives. Further, an FFI in an IGA jurisdiction generally would not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) (any such withholding being "FATCA Withholding") from payments it makes.

<<<

 Under each Model IGA, a Reporting FI would still be required to report certain information in respect of its account holders and investors to its home government or to the IRS. The United States and Denmark have signed an agreement (the "United

<<<

 States-Denmark IGA") based largely on the Model 1 IGA.
If the Issuer is treated as a Reporting FI pursuant to the United States-Denmark IGA it does not anticipate that it will be obliged to deduct any FATCA Withholding on payments it makes

<<<

. There can be no assurance, however, that the Issuer will be treated as a Reporting FI, or that it would in the future not be required to deduct FATCA Withholding from payments it makes. Accordingly, the Issuer and financial institutions through

<<<

 which payments on the Notes are made may be required to withhold FATCA Withholding if (i) any FFI through or to which payment on such Notes is made is not a Participating FFI, a Reporting FI, or otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance

<<<

 with FATCA or (ii) an investor is a Recalcitrant Holder.
Whilst the Notes are in global form and held within the clearing systems, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Notes

<<<

 by the Issuer, any Paying Agent and the common depositary given that each of the entities in the payment chain beginning with the Issuer and ending with the clearing systems is a major financial institution whose business is dependent on compliance

<<<

 with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Notes. The documentation expressly contemplates the possibility that the Notes may go into definitive form and therefore that they may be taken

<<<

 out of the clearing systems. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. However, Definitive Notes will only be printed in remote circumstances.
FATCA is particularly complex and its application

<<<

 is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and model IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form. Prospective investors should consult

<<<

 their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to payments they may receive in connection with the Notes.
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH IRS CIRCULAR 230, EACH TAXPAYER IS HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY TAX DISCUSSION HEREIN IS

<<<

 NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY THE TAXPAYER FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE TAXPAYER; (B) ANY SUCH TAX DISCUSSION WAS WRITTEN TO SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING

<<<

 OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) THE TAXPAYER SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THE TAXPAYER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISER.
The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT")
On 14 February 2013,

<<<

 the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States

<<<

").
64

The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain

<<<

 circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating

<<<

 Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b

<<<

) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State. A joint statement issued in May 2014 by ten of the eleven participating Member States indicated an intention to implement the FTT progressively

<<<

, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain derivatives, with this initial implementation occurring by 1 January 2016. The FTT, as initially implemented on this basis, may not apply to dealings in the Notes. The FTT proposal remains

<<<

 subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and is the subject of legal challenge. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of Notes

<<<

 are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

 bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or Issuer's affiliates. Certain of the Managers or their affiliates

<<<

 that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Managers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering

<<<

 into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes

<<<

. The Managers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire

<<<

, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. 13. The indication of the yield of the Notes is 9.770 per cent. per annum and is calculated as at the date of this Offering Memorandum on the basis of the Issue Price. It is not

<<<

 an indication of future yield. 14. The language of this Offering Memorandum is English. Certain legislative references and technical terms have been cited in their original language in order that the correct technical meaning may be ascribed

<<<

 to them under applicable law.
