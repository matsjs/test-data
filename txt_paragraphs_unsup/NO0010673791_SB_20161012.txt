<<<

 Tillitsmann ASA) (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (together the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issues (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issues"), a senior secured bond issue of USD 165,000,000 (the "Secured Bonds

<<<

") and a senior unsecured bond issue of USD 30,000,000 (the "Unsecured Bonds") issued by IGas Energy Pic (the "Issuer").

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Secured Bonds dated

<<<

 21 March 2013 (as amended and restated by an amendment and restatement agreement dated 24 September 2015, the "Secured Bond Agreement") and/or the bond agreement for the Unsecured Bonds dated 10 December 2013 (as amended and restated by an

<<<

 amendment and restatement agreement dated 24 September 2015, the "Unsecured Bond Agreement" and together with the Secured Bond Agreement, the "Bond Agreements"), unless otherwise stated herein.

The information in this summons regarding the

 Issuer, the market conditions and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

CURRENT TRADING AND MARKET UPDATE

The Issuer, one o f the leading producers o f hydrocarbons onshore Britain, continues to identify projects to enhance production and utilise its stranded gas with four planning applications

<<<

 approved in the first half year of 2016. Progress continues against the Issuer's five year shale development plan with two applications in the final phases of determination in the East Midlands and following the final 3D seismic interpretation

<<<

 and assessment, identifying drilling locations in the North West. The Issuer operates one of

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

the largest net acreage positions in the UK, with a total gross carried

<<<

 shale work programme of c. USD 230 million as at 30 June 2016.
As announced by the Issuer in connection with the publication of its Interim Accounts on 30 September 2016, production remains stable across its assets. It was impacted in the first

<<<

 half year by certain key wells requiring maintenance and these wells have now been brought back online. Although production levels are currently back at c.2,600 boepd, given the lower production in the first half of 2016 the Group has revised

<<<

 its anticipated range for the year to 31 December 2016 to 2,400 - 2,600 boepd.
DeGolyer & MacNaughton ("D&M"), the leading international reserves and resources auditors, has completed an independent evaluation of the Group's conventional and

<<<

 shale interests as at 31 July 2016. Their estimates have indicated IP and 2P conventional reserves of 8.3 MMboe and 13.3 MMboe, respectively, with conventional IP and 2P NPV10 estimates of c.US$200 million and c.US$280 million based on production

<<<

 forecasts, capex, opex and price assumptions1. In addition, D&M has estimated that the Group has 2.5 trillion cubic feet (ca. 440 MMboe)2of net risked shale gas resources after taking into account an estimated geological chance of success.

As the Issuer has previously reported, while it has and is pursuing discussions with a number of strategic investors and evaluating options for cash and earnings accretive transactions, including farm-outs and other asset portfolio management

<<<

 opportunities to improve its cash position and de-leverage its balance sheet, there was a risk of potential non-compliance with certain of its financial covenants in the second half of 2016. The Issuer's current forecasts project non-compliance

<<<

 with its daily Liquidity covenant in the week commencing 24 October 2016. Notwithstanding this projected covenant breach, the Issuer continues to hold significant cash resources to meet its ordinary course financing and trading obligations

<<<

 for a sustained period of time.
In order to allow the Issuer a stable platform and necessary time to assess and explore options with Bondholders in connection with its financing arrangements and capital structure, the Issuer is seeking the

<<<

 Bondholders' consent for a temporary waiver of the Liquidity covenant and certain other provisions of the Bond Agreements as described herein.
As previously reported, in view of the Group's forecast daily liquidity covenant position, the Group

<<<

 may seek to undertake to either sell some of its assets, potentially including a sale of bonds held by the Group or a pre-paid swap of its oil production from 2017, to generate further cash to allow it to maintain sufficient liquidity in advance

<<<

 of the forecasted breach.
The board of directors of the Issuer believes that reaching a consensual solution would be in the interests of all stakeholders of the Group, in particular because the Group has a number of valuable rights and interests

<<<

, including the benefit of substantial carry agreements in respect of future development costs on a number of its licences, which may be adversely affected and lead to a significant loss in value in the event a consensual solution could not

<<<

 be reached.
The Issuer has entered into proactive dialogue with certain key Bondholders in connection with the Issuer's current position and future options. All Bondholders are invited to contact KPMG LLP

The Bond Trustee is hereby authorised:

(i)

to do all things and take such steps on behalf of the Bondholders as may be necessary

or desirable in connection with the Proposal and

<<<

/or the Issuer Undertakings, including,

without limitation, negotiating and approving the final terms of, and entering into, any

and all documentation and agreements deemed necessary or desirable by the Bond

<<<


and/or the Issuer Undertakings and are required in order to implement the Proposal

and/or the Issuer Undertakings; or (C) would not materially and adversely affect the

position of the Bondholders.

7

To approve the Resolution in either

<<<

 Bond Issue, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Voting Bonds in such Bond Issue represented in person or by proxy at the Bondholders' Meeting must vote in favour of the Resolution. If such majority is not obtained but Bondholders representing

<<<

 a simple majority of the Voting Bonds in either of the Bond Issues represented in person or by proxy at the Bondholders' Meeting have voted in favour of the Resolution, section 3(b) of this summons (for this purpose, the "Simple Majority Proposal

<<<

") will, until the Expiry Date, be deemed to have been approved on the terms and subject to the conditions set out herein, without any further vote, meeting, approval, notice or consent being required. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Simple

<<<

 Majority Proposal has been approved, the authorisation of the Bond Trustee in the Resolution shall only apply insofar as it authorises the Bond Trustee to act in relation to the Simple Majority Proposal and the Issuer Undertakings.
In order

<<<

 to form a quorum under either Bond Issue, at least 1/2 of the Voting Bonds in such Bond Issues must be represented at the Bondholders' Meeting.
The amendments to the Bond Agreements for either Bond Issue pursuant to the Proposal shall take

<<<

 effect immediately upon approval by the Bondholders' Meeting under such Bond Issue.
Other than the amendments and waivers necessary to reflect the Proposal, the terms and conditions of each of the Bond Agreements will remain unchanged and continue

<<<

 to apply in their existing form.
Please find attached hereto a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), which indicates your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds

<<<

 and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm: (i) the owner of the Bonds; (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the

<<<

 Bonds; and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.
The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder

<<<

's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the

<<<

 Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership o f the Bonds.
For practical purposes

<<<

, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (mail@nordictrustee.no) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time

<<<

) the Business Day before the Bondholders' Meeting takes place.
Yours Sincerely,
Nordic Trustee ASA
