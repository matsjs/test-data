 Bond Issue 2014/2019 (the "Bond Issue")
Oslo, 25 April 2017
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA acts as Bond Trustee for the Bond Issue.
All capitalised terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning

<<<

 assigned to them in the bond agreement (the "Bond Agreement") dated 6 November 2014 for the 9.75 per cent Neptuno Finance Limited Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2014/2019 with ISIN NO 001 072252.3 between Neptuno Finance Limited (the "Issuer

<<<

") and Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee").
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information

<<<

.
1. Background
The Issuer is part of the Marina Bay Investing group (the "Group"), which is in the business of owning, operating and chartering the offshore accommodation and construction unit "Neptuno" (the "Rig"). The Issuer issued the Bonds

<<<

 in an aggregate amount of USD 207,500,000 in November 2014, and the present outstanding principal amount is USD 179,596,266. The Bonds are currently not listed.
In spite of challenging market conditions within the international oil service

<<<

 segment, the Issuer remains in compliance with all terms and conditions of the Bond Agreement.
However, with a view to simplifying and cleaning up financial relations between Cotemar S.A. de C.V. (the "Charterer") and its business counterparts

<<<

, the Charterer has requested that its claim against Neptuno Offshore Pte. Ltd ("Rigco") in the amount of USD 79,689,852.00 (the "Charterer Subordinated Loan"), granted pursuant to a subordinated loan agreement (the "Subordinated Loan Agreement

<<<

"), be assigned to Magellan Maritime Ltd. ("Magellan"). The proposed assignment of the Charterer Subordinated Loan will strengthen the Charterer's financial condition as counterparty under the charter contract with Rigco, and also potentially

<<<

 secure new business and income for the Charterer by enabling it to participate in bidding processes that require lower leverage in general. The Charterer has

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

subordinated

<<<

 all its claims against the Issuer and Rigco, including the Charterer Subordinated Loan, to the claims of the Bondholders pursuant to the terms of a certain letter of undertaking in favour of the Bond Trustee (the "Charterer Guarantee and Subordination

<<<

 Undertaking"). As part of the proposed assignment, Magellan will adhere to the Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Undertaking and assume the same subordination undertakings currently in place in respect of the Charterer Subordinated Loan

<<<

 pursuant to an addendum to the Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Undertaking (the "Addendum"). Also, the Charterer will maintain its subordination undertaking relative to any claim other than the Charterer Subordinated Loan which the Charterer

<<<

 may have or get against the Issuer, Rigco and/or Marina Bay Investing Pte. Ltd. and any other entity which may become an Obligor under the Bond Agreement.
The Bondholders' consent is also sought for the right of Magellan, in its sole option

<<<

 at any time in the future and without further consultation with or approval from the Bondholders, to further assign its right to and interest in the Charterer Subordinated Loan to its Singapore-based parent company, Super Marine Pte. Ltd. 

<<<

("Super Marine"). Super Marine is a corporation based in Singapore, with the same ultimate beneficial owners as Rigco. Any such assignment to Super Marine will be subject to (i) the security interest in the Charterer Subordinated Loan in favour

<<<

 of the Bond Trustee remaining in place and being unaffected by any such assignment, (ii) Super Marine assuming subordination undertakings in relation to the Charterer Subordinated Loan similar to those undertaken by Magellan in the Addendum

<<<

, and (iii) receipt of legal opinions and any other documents reasonably required by the Bond Trustee (the "Magellan/Super Marine Option").
Today, the Charterer Subordinated Loan does not form part of the Security Documents which secure the

<<<

 Bonds. In order to induce the Bondholders to consent to the requests set out herein, Magellan has, however, agreed to assign its claim against Rigco under the Charterer Subordinated Loan to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) as

<<<

 additional security for the Issuer's performance of its obligations under the Bond Agreement. A similar assignment will be provided by Super Marine if and when the Magellan/Super Marine Option is exercised.
In summary, in the Issuer's opinion

<<<

, no change will result from the proposed assignment other than (i) the replacement of the Charterer with Magellan (and, potentially, Super Marine) as the subordinating party under the Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Undertaking in relation

<<<

 to the claim under the Charterer Subordinated Loan, and (ii) a strengthening of the security interests of the Bondholders by way of the assignment of the Charterer Subordinated loan as security for the Bonds.
The proposed assignment will introduce

<<<

 a new party - Magellan - to the Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Undertaking. Magellan is a corporation based in the Bahamas, with the same ultimate beneficial owners as Rigco. Section 6.1 of the Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Undertaking

<<<

 provides that the Charterer's "duties and obligations cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred to any other person". The Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Agreement is an attachment to the Bond Agreement, and therefore constitutes part

<<<

 of the Bond Agreement. A change to the Bond Agreement will require the consent of the Bondholders, ref clause 16.3.5 which provides, in pertinent part, that "a majority of at least 2/3 of the Voting Bonds represented at the Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

 is required for any waiver or amendment of any terms of this Bond Agreement".

Upon consultation with its tax advisors, the Issuer has confirmed that the proposed assignment to Magellan and, if relevant, to Super Marine, will have no effect

<<<

 on the tax position of any of the Obligors or the Group as a whole.

2. The proposed amendments (the "Proposal")
In accordance with the outline in section 1 above, it is proposed that

1.

Subject to item 2 immediately below, the Bondholders

<<<

 consent to the proposed assignment of

the Charterer Subordinated Loan and, subject to satisfaction of the relevant conditions to such

transfer, the grant of the Magellan/Super Marine Option; and

2.

The following documents will be entered

<<<

 into:

(a)

an addendum to the Subordinated Loan Agreement whereby the lender's rights and interest in

the Subordinated Loan to Magellan on the same terms;

(b)

an addendum to the Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Undertaking whereby

<<<

 Magellan

confirms and assumes the subordination undertaking, and (ii) the Charterer confirms that all its

present and future claims (other than the Charterer Subordinated Loan) shall remain subject to

the subordination undertaking set out

<<<

 in the Charterer Guarantee and Subordination

Undertaking;

(c)

a security agreement whereby Magellan assigns all of its right to and interest in the Charterer

Subordinated Loan in favour of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders

<<<

) as further

security for the performance by the Issuer of its obligations under the Bond Agreement; and

(d)

if relevant, the arrangements set out in item (i) and (ii) be assumed by and made applicable to

Super Marine accordingly in the

<<<

 event Magellan exercises the Magellan/Super Marine Option.

It is proposed that the Bond Trustee is authorised and empowered to agree and sign such Addendum to the Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Undertaking on behalf of the Bondholders

<<<

.

The Proposal shall be conditional on the Bond Trustee receiving such customary documents as it reasonable requests in a form and substance satisfactory to it, including relevant legal opinions.

3. Evaluation of the Proposal
The Proposal

<<<

 is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation from the Bond Trustee, and the Bond Trustee emphasises that each Bondholder should cast its vote in the Bondholders' Meeting based on its own evaluation of the Proposal

<<<

. Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable and vote accordingly. The Bond Trustee urges each Bondholder to seek advice

<<<

 in order to evaluate the Proposal.

The Bond Trustee has been informed that Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Voting Bonds have irrevocable undertaken to vote in favour of the Proposal.

For further questions to the Issuer, please

the owner of such Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of such Bonds and (in) the account number in VPS on which the relevant Bonds are

Background and situation overview
On November 6, 2014 Neptuno Finance issued a USD 207.5 million senior secured callable bond (the "Bond") for the acquisition of the semisubmersible platform

<<<

 Neptuno ("NEPTUNO ")
· NEPTUNO is a modern semi-submersible accommodation and construction rig · NEPTUNO was delivered on January 5, 2015 from COSCO Shipyard in Nantong in China ("C O S C O ") · The Bond has 1st lien security in NEPTUNO and

<<<

 falls due for repayment in Nov-19 After three (3) months of mobilization from China to Mexico, NEPTUNO started working as part of an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction ("E P C ") contract for the maintenance of PEMEX processing centers

<<<

 offshore · Initially substituting the Britannia semi-submersible platform for ~25 days during a thruster maintenance exercise In January 2016, NEPTUNO started working as part of a five (5) year EPC contract with PEMEX for work on different

<<<

 fixed offshore platforms, starting with the Abkatun platform As of this date, the Issuer remains in compliance with all requirements and covenants under the bond agreement · In a challenging market environment for oil service companies in general

<<<

, Neptuno Finance has to date paid all scheduled interest and
amortization (both fixed and cash sweep) to bondholders In this proposal, the bondholders are being asked (A) to approve the assignment of the charterer subordinated loan of -USD

<<<

 76.7 million ("Charterer Subordinated Loan"), whereby Magellan Maritime Ltd. ("Magellan") will replace Cotemar S.A. de C.V. ("Charterer") and become the new creditor, and (B) to approve any future transfer of the Charterer Subordinated Loan

<<<

 to Magellan's parent company: Super Marine Pte. Ltd. ("Super Marine"), Any such transfer to Super Marine will not require new bondholder approval considering that the security package will remain unchanged if such transfer is executed. As an

<<<

 additional security, Magellan has agreed to assign to the Trustee its rights under the Charterer Subordinated Loan The assignment, which is subject to the continued subordination of the Charterer Subordinated Loan to the claims of the bondholders

<<<

, is:
· Deemed to have no adverse effect on the position of the bondholders or Neptuno Offshore Pte. Ltd. ("R igC o ") as such · Beneficial to Bondholders by providing additional security · Done for the purpose of cleaning up and strengthening

<<<

 the balance sheet of the Charterer · Contingent upon the fact that the beneficiaries of Magellan/Super Marine are the same as for RigCo, being Mr. Mario Davila Davila and his
immediate family

's balance sheet, the Company would like the Charterer Subordinated Loan to be assigned to Magellan as a new creditor, with the option to be further assigned to Magellan's parent company Super Marine in the future. The proposed amendment is

 deemed to have no adverse effect on the position of the bondholders or RigCo Under the terms of the assignment, both Cotemar and Magellan will be bound by the relevant provisions of the original Charterer Guarantee and Subordination Undertaking

COVENANTS

The Assignor undertakes not to do or cause or permit to be done anything which will, or could be reasonably expected to adversely affect the security or the rights of the Assignee or the Bondholders hereunder

<<<

, or cause an Event of Default to occur, or which is in any way inconsistent with or depreciates, jeopardises or otherwise prejudices the security or the rights of the Assignee hereunder, and, further, to take such action as shall from time
