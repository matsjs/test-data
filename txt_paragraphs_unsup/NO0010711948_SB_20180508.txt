Oslo, 9 May 2018

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING
Nordic Trustee AS (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders o f the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above-mentioned bond issue (the "Bond

<<<

 Issue") where Noram Drilling Company AS (formerly Global Rig Company AS) (the "Issuer", and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group") is the issuer.

All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement

<<<

 originally dated 3 June 2014 (as amended and restated on 30 October 2015, the "Bond Agreement") and made between the Bond Trustee and the Issuer, unless otherwise stated herein.

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market

<<<

 conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1

BACKGROUND

Reference is made to the Bondholders' Meeting held on 6 December 2017 pursuant to which the

<<<

 Bondholders, inter alia, for the period to and including 30 June 2018, temporarily waived the financial covenants set out in Clause 13.7 (a) (Equity Ratio) of the Bond Agreement (the "Equity Covenant"), by reducing it from 35 % to 25 %, and

<<<

 where the requirement to maintain a minimum Liquidity set out in Clause 13.7 (b) (Liquidity) of the Bond Agreement (the "Liquidity Covenant") was reduced from USD 10,000,000 to USD 5,000,000.

The Issuer is continuously monitoring the financial

<<<

 covenants in the Bond Agreement, which are still impacted by inter alia the prevailing market conditions, and the Group's current forecasts project continuing non-compliance with the Equity Covenant and the Liquidity Covenant. To this end,

<<<

 the Issuer has concluded that it is likely that the Issuer will be in breach of the Equity Covenant and the Liquidity Covenant for the remainder of the year ending 31 December 2018.

Furthermore, pursuant to Clause 10.1 (Maturity and instalments

<<<

) of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer is required to repay the Bonds in instalments due on the Interest Payment Dates in the amount of USD 6,000,000. According to the current market conditions, the Issuer will face challenges with the amortization

<<<

 of the Bonds on the Interest Payment Date 3 June 2018.

While the Issuer faces a likely financial covenant breach and difficulties with the amortization of the Bonds in June 2018, the Issuer has sufficient cash to pay, and intends

<<<

 to pay, the scheduled interest payment due on 3 June under the Bond Agreement.

WAIVERS

The Issuer proposes that the Bondholders temporarily waive:

1. the Equity Covenant, by reducing it from 35% to 23.5% for a period from 1 July 2018

 to and including 1 January 2019;
2. the Liquidity Covenant, by reducing it from USD 10,000,000 to USD 5,000,000 for a period from 1 July 2018 to and including 1 January 2019; and
3. the amortization on the Interest Payment Date falling 3 June

<<<

 2018, with the effect that the Issuer shall not make any payment of instalments on this Interest Payment Date, but shall make a one-time instalment payment of USD 2,000,000 (plus accrued interest) on 31 July 2018 and pay the remaining USD 

<<<

4,000,000 of the instalment on the Maturity Date, together with any Outstanding Bonds,
together referred to as (the "Waivers").
The Issuer proposes that the Waivers are granted. As compensation for the Waivers, the Issuer offers a waiver fee

<<<

 to the Bondholders upon approval in the Bondholders' Meeting, as further set out in section 4 below.

<<<

 Bondholders holding in aggregate more than 2/3 of the Bonds have undertaken that they will vote in favour of the proposal.

<<<

' Meeting be held to consider and resolve the following (the "Proposal"):

<<<

 summons (including without limitation waive any time periods or deadlines).
