· Equity Issue: The Borrower shall complete a new equity issue of NOK 146,250,000 at a price of minimum NOK 0.60 per

<<<

<<<

<<<

 is called, the New 50m Bond Issue shall be provided. The New 50m Bond Issue shall be in the same amount as the amount converted from the principal of the 2009 Loans, and is guaranteed by one or more bondholders in the 2009 Loans. The bondholders

<<<

 in the 2009 Loans shall have the right to subscribe for their pro rata share of such new bond.
· New secured bank credit facility up to USD 5 million: The Borrower shall have the right to establishing a new credit facility which will be secured

<<<

4 EVALUATION

<<<

 OF THE PROPOSAL 4.1 The Company's evaluation The Company has previously evaluated various alternatives for a financial restructuring to meet its debt commitments and safeguard values for all stakeholders. The current cash generation is not

<<<

 sufficient to meet the current debt amortization schedule and available liquidity is limited. Consequently, a restructuring of the current amortization plan is required. The main objective with the proposed Restructuring is to safeguard values

<<<

 and secure a viable financial platform for the Company. Although the Company acknowledges that significant concessions are required from all stakeholders, the Restructuring represents in the Company's view a balanced proposal which will benefit

<<<

 all stakeholders. The Restructuring will increase headroom and is expected to safeguard values for the Bondholders.
Furthermore, the Company and the financial advisors are of the opinion that the proposed amendments to the Bond Loans are required

<<<

 to facilitate the Equity Issue in the Company, which will be to the benefit of the Bondholders.
Correspondingly, the Company is of the opinion that the Proposal is to the advantage of the Bondholders, and that the Proposal is fully aligned

<<<

 with the interests of the Bondholders.
The Company has engaged ABG Sundal Collier Norge ASA and Carnegie ASA as its financial advisors with respect to the Proposal, as defined below. The law firm Wikborg Rein acts as legal advisor to the Company

<<<

 (together referred to as the "Advisors"). The Advisors are acting solely for the Company and no-one else in connection with the Proposal. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by the Advisors with respect to the Company and

<<<

 the Advisors expressly disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein).

<<<

 the "Bond Advisors") have been mandated by NTM in accordance with the preceding discussions with the Company leading to this Summons. It is the Bond Advisors' evaluation that this is a sustainable and viable
