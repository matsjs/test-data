 Bergen Yards Holding AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2008

Oslo, 7th March 2008

PROPOSAL TO AMEND MATURITY DATE IN LOAN AGREEMENT SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING

Background

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the

<<<

 above-captioned loan (the "Loan") where Bergen Group AS (previously named Bergen Yards Holding AS) ("Bergen Group" / the "Company") is the borrower.

All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the agreement

<<<

 of the Loan (the "Loan Agreement") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.

Bergen Group is in the process of seeking listing on Oslo Børs (Oslo Stock Exchange). In order to get a listing approval, the exchange

<<<

 requires the company to be fully funded for at least 12 months after listing takes place. As the Loan matures in November 2008, Bergen Group does not currently fulfill this requirement. Consequently, Bergen Group seeks to extend the maturity

<<<

 o f the Loan with 8 months.

2007 was a historical year for Bergen Group. By the end of 2007 the Company had completed the acquisition of 21 offshore and technology related companies. Consequently, the Company went from being a group of traditional

<<<

 yards to becoming a high-technical industrial group. This was according to the Company's strategic decision to establish the Company within four business areas: Shipbuilding, Maritime Service, Offshore and Technology.

Restructuring and building

<<<

 up effective organizations within each business area have been the main focuses for the Company over the last months. The Company's order intake has continued to develop positively since the Loan was issued, and the pro forma results for the

<<<

 4Q 2007, as well as the full year of 2007, has been good in the
