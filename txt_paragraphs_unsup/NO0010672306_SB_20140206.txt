Background

The Issuers have summoned a Bondholders' Meeting for each Tranche with the main purpose of proposing to the relevant Bondholders that they resolve (among other things) to approve the amendments of certain provisions of the

<<<

 Finance Documents, as further described in Schedule 2 {Details o f the Amendments) hereto (collectively, the "Amendments"), and to authorise the Bond

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

Trustee to enter into the agreements, documents and instruments necessary to give effect to the Amendments.

The Amendments are being suggested to the Bondholders as a

<<<

 consequence of the delay in the delivery of Hull 717 - and which in turn has delayed the process of refinancing the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds, both of which mature on 21 February 2014 regardless of actual delivery of Hull 717

<<<

. The holders of the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds have agreed to extend the maturity of the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds in return for shares in the Parent Issuer. The background for the Amendments and the issuance o f

<<<

 shares in the Parent Issuer in respect therewith are further described in the press release from the Parent Guarantor attached as Schedule 3 (Press release dated 30 January 2014) hereto. The Parent Issuer continues its work on getting Hull

<<<

 717 on a charter and the process of refinancing the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds.

The Amendments include the following:

(a)

An amendment of the definition of "Tranche A and B Maturity Date" whereby the maturity

dated is extended

<<<

 to 1 April 2014 or, if elected by the Parent Issuer, to 1 May 2014. It is the

opinion o f the Issuers that the extension of the maturity date for the Tranche A Bonds and

the Tranche B Bonds does not require the consent from the Bondholders

<<<

 in the other

tranches. However, Bondholders are asked to consent to the relevant amendments to avoid

any uncertainty there might be on the matter.

(b)

An amendment to Clauses 13.2(g) and 13.2(h) o f the Second Amended and Restated Bond

<<<



Loan Agreement which relate to the circumstances in which an auction process must be

launched in respect of Hull 717. The amendment will permit the auction process to be

launched immediately after the new maturity date for the Tranche A

<<<

 Bonds and the Tranche

B Bonds rather than the original requirement to launch the auction 20 Banking Days before

the scheduled delivery of Hull 717. This amendment is requested to facilitate a refinancing

of the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche

<<<

 B Bonds in the period leading up to the Delivery

Date for Hull 717.

(c)

An amendment to the terms of the share pledge agreement (the "Share Pledge Agreement")

dated 20 February 2013 and relating to the pledge of the Parent Guarantor's 

<<<

(Cecon ASA)

shares in the Parent Issuer (Rever Offshore AS). The amendment will remove any potential

uncertainty there might be on whether the issuance of shares in the Parent Issuer to a third

party require those shares to be pledged in

<<<

 favour of the Bond Trustee as First Security

Agent and Second Security Agent. It is the opinion of the Issuers that the Parent Issuer shall

have, and has had, the right to issue new shares to third parties without it being required that


<<<


such new shares shall be pledged. However, Bondholders are asked to consent to the relevant

amendments to avoid any potential uncertainty there might be on the matter. Any additional

shares in the Parent Issuer subscribed or otherwise acquired

<<<

 by the Parent Guarantor must be

pledged as security to the First Security Agent and the Second Security Agent, cf. Clause 3

of the Share Pledge Agreement.
