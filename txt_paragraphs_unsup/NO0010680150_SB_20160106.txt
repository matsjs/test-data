Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Nordic

<<<

 Trustee ASA ("Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issues with ISIN NO 001 0680150 (with total outstanding amount of USD 95 million) ("PLCS02"), NO 001 0714389 (with total outstanding

<<<

 amount of NOK 350 million) ("PLCS03", and together with PLCS02, the "Unsecured Bonds") and NO 001 0607435 (with total outstanding amount of USD 101.9 million) (the "CB", and together with the Unsecured Bonds, the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issues

<<<

") issued by Polarcus Ltd as issuer (the "Issuer" or the "Company"). The Issuer and its subsidiaries are referred to as the "Group".

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and

<<<

 the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1. BACKGROUND
In addition to this summons letter, the Company has provided a separate presentation which is intended to give background information

<<<

 and an update on the Company's financial and operating status, including the proposed Restructuring (as defined below) of the Company (the "Company Update"), enclosed as Annex C hereto. Bondholders are encouraged to read both these documents

<<<

, in addition to Annex B - the "Restructuring Term Sheet", to obtain an understanding of the proposed Restructuring.
1.1 Introduction
Polarcus (OSE: PLCS) delivers high-end towed streamer data acquisition and imaging services through the operation

<<<

 of a fleet of high performance 3D seismic vessels. Polarcus offers contract seismic surveys and multi-client projects with advanced on-board processing solutions and employs nearly 500 professionals worldwide.
The Group has been adversely impacted

<<<

 by the severe industry downturn, where the continuing and significant decline in the price of oil has caused depressed levels of seismic spending by oil companies, and a knock on reduction in demand for the Group's services, lower vessel rates

<<<

 and less favorable payment terms. The industiy downturn has led to several seismic vessels being coldstacked, including Polarcus Nadia. The challenging market conditions show no sign of improving in the near term. Consistent with its peers

<<<

 in the market, the Group has considerable levels of debt (both to bank lenders and bondholders) including (i) USD 101.9 million of secured convertible bonds issued

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

<<<



by the Company, (ii) NOK 350 million of senior unsecured bonds issued by the Company; (iii) USD 95 million of senior unsecured bonds issued by the Company, (iv) USD 263 million of secured bank facilities and (v) USD 171 million of vessel

<<<

 and equipment leases (together the "Debt").
The interest and amortization burden emanating from the Debt is considerable. With USD 100 million scheduled debt service in 2016, the Company's current capital structure is unsustainable in current

<<<

 markets. Whilst macro factors impact the Company's net profitability, a cost management program has reduced costs to a level where the operations are cash positive before debt service and the Group's management remains convinced that with a

<<<

 reduced debt burden, the Group has the capacity to continue to perform profitably as a going concern. The Board of Directors of the Company believes that maintaining this going concern status will provide the best prospects of recovery for

<<<

 all stakeholders.
With this in mind, the Group has engaged specialist advisors to assist it in dealing with its debt obligations and associated restructuring plans. The Group's efforts to improve its liquidity position have been evidenced by

<<<

 a number of steps that have been taken in the past 12-18 months, including:
(i) Amending the terms of its USD 410 million fleet bank facility so as to achieve improved terms, including a new USD 25 million working capital facility;
(ii) Amending

<<<

 the terms of the CB so as to achieve improved terms;
(iii) Continuing successful efforts to significantly reduce the Group's cost base to achieve efficiencies, and restructure its sales function to increase its effectiveness; and
(iv) A partial

<<<

 divestment of the Group's multi-client library in return for a cash consideration of USD 27.5million, accelerated payment of unrelated at-risk contract work and a future revenue share on library late sales.
The efforts undertaken by the Board

<<<

, and the Group as a whole, have had a positive impact. When compared to its peers, the Group is performing well operationally, and has a strong backlog for the immediate and medium term. Furthermore, the Group has gained market share in the

<<<

 past 12 months.
Notwithstanding the abovementioned steps, the Group's financial position remains critical. The industiy is undergoing its most significant downturn in recent history, and the Group's debt levels remain unmanageably high. In

<<<

 December 2015, having regard to numerous factors including the Group's limited liquidity, the lack of refinancing options and uncertainty over the prospects of a future restructuring, the need to safeguard the interests of creditors as a whole

<<<

, and the fiduciary duties of the Group's directors, the Group defaulted on certain interest payments due on its debt facilities. In the absence of a holistic financial restructuring being speedily implemented, further defaults are likely to

<<<

 follow imminently, and the Group will be unable to continue as a going concern. If such circumstances were to eventuate, the Company will inevitably go into formal winding up proceedings, and the Group faces the risk ultimately of being liquidated

<<<

 under the supervision of the Cayman Islands and Norwegian courts. The outcome of such proceedings for stakeholders of the Group is highly uncertain. However, based on a value distribution analysis undertaken by Deloitte dated 19 October 20

<<<

15, the prospects of any recovery to unsecured creditors are slim and unlikely to exceed 8% at best. The prospect of any returns to shareholders in the event of a Group liquidation is essentially zero. Secured creditors will have a recovery

<<<

 determined by the realizable value of the pledged assets which will include all the vessels and the multi-client libraiy. Whilst the magnitude of recovery and timing of realization is uncertain, their expected recovery will be substantially

<<<

 better than for the unsecured creditors.
The Board has been working tirelessly with its professional advisors, the Group's bank and bondholder creditors, and its shareholders, to identity and pursue a restructuring plan that is capable
-2-

<<<



of returning the Group to profitable going concern status, and which has a viable prospect of being implemented. The Issuer has, as part of this work, held several discussions with key stakeholders in order to agree on a solution to reduce

<<<

 the debt and the debt service payments during the next two years of the Issuer and the Group as a whole (the "Restructuring"). The discussions have led to bilateral agreements on a refinancing proposal with the Issuer's banks, a sale leaseback

<<<

 provider, certain bondholders in the Bond Issues and certain shareholders.
Implementation of the restructuring proposal set out in Annex B to this summons requires certain amendments to the bond agreements for the Bond Issues. The bondholders

<<<

' meeting is summoned to vote on whether or not to approve the proposed amendments to the terms and conditions of the Bond Issues. The requested changes are summarised in this summons and set out in detail in Annex B (the Restructuring Term

<<<

 Sheet) together with the main terms of the whole restructuring plan. Reference is also made to the Company's stock exchange notice released on 6 January 2016 where it announced that it had obtained support from key stakeholders for a restructuring

<<<

 of the Company's balance sheet.
1.2 Key Terms of the Restructuring
The proposed Restructuring will comprise of (summary of main features only, please refer to Annex B for a complete overview):
 The Company's bank facilities are extended until

<<<

 30 June 2022 with a repayment freeze on amortization until 1 January 2018. There will be normal service of interest throughout the tenure of the bank facilities.
 The Company's USD 25 million working capital facility is made more accessible

<<<

 and extended to 1 July 2018. The working capital facility will be subject to semi-annual clean down minimum three months apart.
 The CB will be separated into a total of three tranches, CB Tranche A, CB Tranche B1 and CB Tranche B2. Based on

<<<

 the value distribution analysis prepared by Deloitte, 70% of the CB is considered as de facto secured and will be separated into a new "CB Tranche A". CB Tranche A will mature on 30 March 2022 with repayment freeze on amortization payments

<<<

 until 1 January 2018. There will be normal service of interest for CB Tranche A throughout the tenure of CB Tranche A.
 The remaining 30% of the CB is considered as de facto unsecured. The unsecured part of the CB will be separated into two

<<<

 tranches, CB Tranche B1 and CB Tranche B2 (jointly referred to as "CB Tranche B"). CB Tranche B will in all material respects be treated equal to the Unsecured Bonds as set out below and in detail in Annex B (Restructuring Term Sheet). The

<<<

 maturity date of CB Tranche B will be 30 December 2022.
 Whether bondholders holding bonds in the "unsecured part" of the CB will receive bonds in CB Tranche B1 or CB Tranche B2 is subject to the bondholders' allocation of its "unsecured bonds

<<<

" in the mix and match option set out below and in detail in Annex B (Restructuring Term Sheet). The mix and match allocation agreement is attached to this summons as Annex D and all bondholders are kindly requested to fill out this agreement

<<<

 and deliver it to ABG Sundal Collier ASA as set out in the agreement.
 The Issuer has today two unsecured bond issues, one denominated in NOK and one denominated in USD. Each of the Unsecured Bonds will be separated into two tranches based

<<<

 on bondholders' allocation in the mix and match allocation agreement, extended to 30 December 2022 with no interest accruing until 1 July 2018 and an adjusted interest profde
-3 -

thereafter. The call option price and the interest rate will

<<<

 be different for the two tranches of the Unsecured Bonds, otherwise the tranches will be on the same terms.
 Mix and match: Bondholders holding Unsecured Bonds and bonds in the "unsecured part" of the CB are offered a choice between (A) accepting

<<<

 a reduction to the call option prices for its bonds and make other changes as described in Annex B but otherwise keep their current bonds which will then be separated into CB Tranche B1 or the Unsecured A Tranches (as the case may be) and/or

<<<

 (B) convert approximately 0.5% of their bonds into new shares in the Issuer which will be subscribed for at the Conversion Price, accept a reduction to the call option prices for its bonds below the reduced call option price for alternative

<<<

 (A) and make other changes as described in Annex B, but otherwise retain approximately 99.5% of their existing bonds which will then be separated into CB Tranche B2 or (as the case may be) the Unsecured B Tranches.
 If all bondholders elect

<<<

 to subscribe for shares in the mix and match proposal, such bondholders will in total hold 90% of the shares in the Company while the existing shareholders will hold the remaining 10%.
 Bondholders who do not make allocation of its bonds in

<<<

 the mix and match application agreement within the deadline specified in Annex D, will automatically have all their bonds separated into the Unsecured A Tranches and/or (as the case may be) CB Tranche B1 and will not receive any shares in the

<<<

 Company.
 The proposed Restructuring entails that the call option prices for the Unsecured Bonds and CB Tranche B will be significantly reduced from the current levels in all tranches, with the lowest call option prices for CB Tranche B2 and

<<<

 the Unsecured B Tranches. This reduction will enable the Company to call the bonds in these tranches at levels well below par value of the bonds.
 The new shares in the Company to be issued to Bondholders subscribing for shares will be Class

<<<

 B shares with par value of USD 0.0013 each. Except for the lower par value, this class of shares will have the same rights as the existing issued shares in the Company. Subject to applicable law, the Company reserves the right to repurchase

<<<

 Class B shares issued to Bondholders in consideration for the issue of shares in the Company of the existing class on a one for one basis. The new Class B shares will be listed on Oslo Stock Exchange or (as the case may be) Oslo Axess.
 The

<<<

 Company's sale and leaseback agreements are amended from financial leases to operational leases. Further, the term of the agreements are extended by two years until 2021. The lease rates are reduced from 1 December 2015 until 1 January 201

<<<

8 to USD 8,000/day and USD 9,500/day, and thereafter reduced to USD 26,700/day and USD 31,500/day.
 A cash sweep mechanism will be established in favor of the banks, the sale leaseback provider and the bondholders in CB Tranche A.
For a full

<<<

 overview of the Restructuring, please see to Annex B (the Restructuring Term Sheet) which all bondholders are strongly urged to read in its entirety. If there is any discrepancy between the terms set out in this summons and Annex B, the terms

<<<

 set out in Annex B will prevail.
The final agreement pursuant to the support letter entered into between the Company and its bank lenders is subject to an election by the bondholders in the mix and match offer between alternative A and alternative

<<<

 B where the blended call price level for all unsecured bonds does not exceed thirty per cent (30%) in 2018.
-4-

1.3 Voluntary share purchase offer
Certain key shareholders of the Company will launch a voluntary share purchase offer of new

<<<

 shares subscribed by bondholders in connection with the mix and match offer to bondholders. The rationale behind the share purchase offer is to offer bondholders the option of selling their new shares and for the offering shareholders to increase

<<<

 their shareholding in the Company after the implementation of the Restructuring. The terms of the voluntary share purchase offer are as follows (each capitalised term as defined in Annex D):
(i) the voluntary offer is directed to bondholders

<<<

 who elect "Alternative B" in Annex D and will only comprise New Shares;
(ii) the voluntary offer is of an amount of up to USD 4.5 million, however limited so that the offeror(s) acquisition of shares will not trigger an obligation to launch

<<<

 a mandatoiy offer for the shares in the Company;
(iii) the voluntary offer is valid during the Application Period and tenders into the offer will only be accepted during the Application Period;
(iv) the offer price under the voluntary offer

<<<

 is NOK 0.23 per share;
(v) if the amount of shares tendered by bondholders under the voluntary offer exceeds the size of the offer, the offeror(s) will purchase shares from all bondholders who have tendered in based on the pro rata amount of

<<<

 shares offered by each bondholder; and
(vi) settlement under the voluntary offer is subject to and will take place as soon as possible and no later than 14 days after the New Share have been duly issued under Cayman Islands law and delivered

<<<

 in the VPS.

Risk factors - General

Introduction
There are several risk factors of relevance to the Company and the Company has disclosed such risk factors in prospectuses

<<<

 and financial reports. Risk factors might be expanded and new risk factors included in a future listing prospectus which will be available after the completion. Any difference between the information provided in this document and the listing

<<<

 prospectus shall not give stakeholders grounds to change their decisions. The below list is an overview of several important risk factors, but the list is not exhaustive and is complimented by information previously disclosed by the Company

<<<

.

·

General market conditions: The Company's business and operations depend upon conditions in the oil and gas industry including the current and

anticipated prices of oil and gas and the global economic activity. A reduction of the oil price

<<<

 could have a material adverse effect on the business,

operating results and financial condition of the Company.

·

Reduced investment activities: A reduction in the investment and activity levels in the oil and gas industry could materially

<<<

 adversely affect the

Company's business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.

·

Competitive situation: The seismic industry is highly competitive and the Company competes with numerous other companies for a limited

<<<

 number of

projects.

·

Technological developments: If the Company is not successful in developing new equipment and technology, as well as keeping its existing

equipment up to industry standards, in a timely and cost-effective manner, this

<<<

 could materially adversely affect the Company's business and financial

conditions.

·

The Company is exposed to liability by virtue of its operations: The Company is exposed to liability for any defects, delays and shortcomings in the

performance

<<<

 or products provided by it, its suppliers and/or subcontractors.

·

Governmental regulation and political risk: The Company is affected by changes in taxes, regulations and other laws or policies affecting the oil and

gas industry generally

<<<



·

Reliance on key personnel: The Company is to a large extent dependent on certain personnel and directors. The loss of the services of such key

personnel could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or results of operations

<<<

 of the Company.

·

Legal claims and disputes: The Company may be exposed to disputes with authorities, partners or other third parties. Such claims and disputes may

disrupt business operations and could materially adversely effect the business

<<<

 prospects or results of operations of the Company.

·

Interest and currency risk: The fair value of future cash flows of the Company's financial instruments - such as the bond loan denominated in NOK

and the portion of the Company's debt

<<<

 that is at variable interest rates - will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency or interest rates.

·

Service life and technical performance: There can be no guarantee that the vessels or equipment deployed by the Company will have

<<<

 a long service

life. The vessels may have particular unforeseen technical problems or deficiencies, new environmental requirements might be enforced or new

technical solutions or vessels might be introduced to the industry.

·

Multi-client

<<<

 investments: The Company has made considerable investments in acquiring and processing seismic data that the Company owns (multi

client data), but the Company does not know with certainty how much of the multi-client data it will be able to

<<<

 license or at what price.

arcus

Risk factors - Key financial risks
In addition to the general risk factors, the Company's financial situation means the below risk factors should be given careful consideration:
· Going concern - The decline

<<<

 in oil prices and consequent cautious spending by oil companies has negatively impacted the Company's earnings over the past 18 months. This challenging market environment has led to a more uncertain outlook with pressure on day rates and payment

<<<

 terms. As the oil price is still under pressure the Company has yet to see a recovery in tender activity and day rates, hence there is a material uncertainty which may cast doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
· Access

<<<

 to funds - The Company may be dependent on obtaining additional financing in the future. No assurance can be given that such financing will be achieved or that such financing will be on acceptable terms.
· Liquidity risk - The Company's liquidity

<<<

 situation is constrained and although the Company currently believes it has sufficient funds in place which, when combined with available cash resources, are sufficient to meet its short-term financial obligations, there can be no assurance

<<<

 that the Company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Unforeseen liabilities and financial obligations could materially adversely affect the liquidity of the Company.
· Credit risk of clients and

<<<

 partners - The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities, primarily its accounts receivable, accrued revenue and from advance payments made to suppliers and from its cash and cash equivalents deposited with banks.
· High

<<<

 leverage - The Group is highly leveraged which makes it difficult to raise additional debt to finance future operation and development of the Group. The Group's financialflexibility is very limited.
· Valuation risk - Valuation of the Company

<<<

's vessels carried out by third party experts may prove to be wrong and consequently affect covenant compliance in financing agreements
· Multi-jurisdictional operation - The Company operates in international markets and several jurisdictions

<<<

. Should the Company enter into liquidation or severe financial difficulties, recovery of value for stakeholders may be complex and subject to legislation and legal proceedings in several jurisdictions.

Application Agreement for mix and match
(Private Placement

<<<

 of New Shares and New Bonds - January 2016)

ABG Sundal Collier ASA

General Information: Polarcus Ltd. (the "Company" or "Polarcus"), a Cayman Islands limited liability company, is currently in the process of restructuring its balance sheet

<<<

 as described in the summons for bondholder's meetings with annexes, dated 6 January 2016 (the "Summons"). As part of the restructuring, the bondholders in the Company's bond issues with ISIN NO 001 0680150, ISIN NO 001 0714389 and ISIN NO 

<<<

001 0607435 (the "Existing Bonds") are asked to make an election between the two following solutions for their Existing Bonds (where bondholders can choose the split they desire as set out below):

Alternative A

Accept a reduction to the call

<<<

 option prices for its Existing Bonds and other amendments described in Annex B to the Summons. The bonds under Alternative A will continue to exist under the existing ISIN for the relevant Existing Bonds, but will be separated into new tranches

<<<

 referred to as the "Unsecured A Tranches" and the "CB Tranche B1" respectively. Bondholders who do not make an election for their bonds will continue to hold their Existing Bonds on the amended terms for Alternative A.

Alternative B

Subscribe

<<<

 for new Class B-shares in the Company with nominal value USD 0.0013 per share (the "New Shares") at a subscription price of USD 0.0013 per share for bonds denominated in USD and NOK 0.0115 per share for bonds denominated in NOK. The New Shares

<<<

 will be settled against set off of approximately 0.5% of the par value of the Existing Bonds while the remainder approximately 99.5% of the par value of Existing Bonds will be converted into bonds in new tranches with reduced call option prices

<<<

 and other amendments as described in Annex B to the Summons. The tranches under Alternative B (such tranches referred to as the "Unsecured B Tranches and the "CB Tranche B2" respectively) will have call option prices below the tranches under

<<<

 Alternative A.

The Class B-shares are equal to the ordinary shares of the Company, apart from the nominal value. The bonds allocated to Alternative A are referred to as the Existing Bonds, but will be subject to amended terms as set out under

<<<

 Alternative A. The bonds offered in Alternative B are referred to as the "New Bonds". The primary difference between the Existing Bonds and the New Bonds is that the Existing Bonds will have higher interest payments and call price levels than

<<<

 the New Bonds, cf. Annex B to the Summons for further details on the respective bond tranches. The New Shares, the Existing Bonds and the New Bonds are jointly referred to as the "Securities". The Company will use all reasonable efforts to

<<<

 ensure that the Securities are listed on Oslo Stock Exchange or (as the case may be) Oslo Axess as soon as possible after having been issued and registered in relevant registers.
The Securities are offered through a private placement (the 

<<<

"Private Placement") directed towards the bondholders of the initial Existing Bonds registered with the Norwegian Central Securities Depository ("VPS") at the commencement of the Application Period (as defined below). Bondholders being registered

<<<

 after such date will be allocated bonds under Alternative A for all their Existing Bonds.
Certain key shareholders will launch a voluntary share purchase offer (the "Program") of New Shares subscribed by bondholders in connection with the Private

<<<

 Placement. The Program will be in an amount of up to USD 4.5 million, but in any event limited to an aggregate purchase amount that will ensure that the shares held and acquired by the offeror(s) do not place it in a mandatory offer situation

<<<

 under applicable rules. Further details on the Program are set out in the specification of application below.
The Private Placement is carried out subject to applicable exemptions from relevant prospectus requirements, in the United States

<<<

 in reliance on Rule 144A under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "US Securities Act") (to the extent available) and outside the United States in compliance with Rule 903 or Rule 904, as applicable, of Regulation S under

<<<

 the US Securities Act, and the exemptions available under the EU Prospectus Directive as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area ("EEA").
Polarcus has appointed ABG Sundal Collier ASA as Manager (the "Manager") in the Private

<<<

 Placement.
Applications for Securities will be governed by the terms and conditions set out in this application agreement (the "Application Agreement") and the Summons (the "Investor Documentation"). The undersigned (the "Applicant") hereby

<<<

 acknowledges having received and accepted the terms set out in the Investor Documentation and that the application and subscription is subject to the terms set out therein. Applicants selecting Alternative B above authorise and instruct the

<<<

 Manager to convert its Existing Bonds at par value into New Bonds under the relevant bond issue with new ISIN.
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") and the Company will enter into amendment and restatement agreements with amended and restated

<<<

 bond agreements to govern the terms of the Existing Bonds and the New Bonds. The agreements will implement the provisions of the Summons for the relevant tranches of Existing Bonds and New Bonds. The Applicant is, by executing this Application

<<<

 Agreement, deemed to authorise the Bond Trustee to complete such agreements.
