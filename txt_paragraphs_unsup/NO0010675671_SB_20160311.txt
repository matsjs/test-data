INTRODUCTION

Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond

<<<

 issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") by Sterling Resources (UK) Ltd. ("Sterling" or the "Issuer"), and guaranteed by Sterling Resources Ltd. (the "Parent" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group").

Capitalised terms used but not

<<<

 otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally entered into on 2 May 2013 as amended and restated on 12 December 2014 and as further amended and restated on 22 May 2015 and on 30 November 

<<<

2015 (as amended and restated from time to time, the "Bond Agreement"), as further amended by amendment letters on 29 January 2016, 16 February 2016, 22 February 2016 and 29 February 2016 (together the "Amendment Letters") and as further amended

<<<

 by a resolution approved by a Bondholders' Meeting on 7 March 2016 (the "Interim Resolution"),

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and the described restructuring and the proposal set out in Section 3 (Proposed Recapitalisation

<<<

) below is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons letter in its entirety.

BACKGROUND

2.1 Executive Summary

<<<


Pursuant to the Interim Resolution, certain amendments to and waivers of the Bond Agreement were provided in order for discussions to continue between the Parent, the Issuer and a group of large Bondholders holding in aggregate more than 2

<<<

/3 of the Bonds (the "Bondholder Committee") in relation to a recapitalisation of the Group (the "Recapitalisation"). The Recapitalisation which is proposed to be irrevocably authorised by the Bondholders' Meeting will result in the Bonds being

<<<

 written down to an aggregate principal amount of approximately USD40 million (expected to be USD40 million) in exchange for the Bondholders receiving up to

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Osfo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

2/l2
approximately 97% (expected to be 97%) of the total issued shares in the Parent pro rata to their holdings of Bonds.
The Recapitalisation involves:
· the Parent undertaking a Rights Offering (as defined below

<<<

) to existing shareholders entitling them to purchase common shares of the Parent ("Common Shares");
· the gross proceeds received under the Rights Offering (as defined below) (if any) being used to redeem a corresponding aggregate amount (after

<<<

 converting such Canadian dollar denominated proceeds to USD) of Bonds, (including accrued and unpaid interest, redemption premium and amendment fees thereon) pro rata to the Bondholders (the "Purchased Bond Liabilities");
· Outstanding Bonds

<<<

 (including accrued and unpaid interest, redemption premium or amendment fees) (the aggregate liabilities of the Issuer or Parent under or in connection with the Bonds being the "Bond Liabilities") being released/cancelled to an intended aggregate

<<<

 principal amount of USD 40 million (with no accrued and unpaid interest, redemption premium or amendment fees outstanding) (the "Rem aining Bond Liabilities"), in exchange for each Bondholder receiving its pro rata proportion of Common Shares

<<<

 in an amount equal to the aggregate subscription price of the unsubscribed Common Shares under the Rights Offering (as defined below) comprising up to approximately 97% of the total issued shares; and
· new funding being raised by the Issuer

<<<

 under a USD 40 million Super Senior Facility (as defined below).
Certain Canadian procedures will need to be completed, including the filing of preliminary and final prospectuses and the completion of the Rights Offering, before new Common

<<<

 Shares can be issued by the Parent. The process is expected to take 2-3 months from the date of the Bondholders' Meeting after which the Recapitalisation will be completed. The record date on which the Bondholders' pro rata proportion of the

<<<

 Common Shares will be calculated is expected to occur on or about the expiry of this 2-3 month period (the "Bondholder Record Date"). Bondholders will be notified of the Bondholder Record Date shortly prior to its occurrence. There will be

<<<

 a suspension of trading of the Bonds during the period from the Bondholder Record Date to the date when completion of the exchange takes place (expected to be 5 Business Days after the Bondholder Record Date) (the "Closing Date"). Bondholders

<<<

 will, without any further action required. receive their pro rata portion of the Common Shares shortly after such suspension of trading has elapsed. Any gross cash proceeds (if any) from the Rights Offering will be distributed to the Bondholders

<<<

 on or about the same date.
The Bondholders' Meeting will by approval of the proposed resolution set out in Clause 7 of this summons irrevocably authorise and direct the Bond Trustee to acknowledge, covenant and agree to th e Covenants (as defined

<<<

 below).

2.2 O perational Update Production at the UK Breagh gas field (Sterling 30%) in the first two months of 2016 averaged 25.8 million standard feet of sales gas per day net to Sterling. The field

<<<

 continues to achieve a high level of operational facilities uptime, being 99% over that same period. Production at the UK Cladhan field (Sterling 2%) in the first two months o f 2016 averaged 210 barrels of oil per day net to Sterling.
As previously

<<<

 announced, the new operator of the Breagh Field, Ineos, has advised Sterling that it is conducting a review of further investments in Phase 1 of the field's development with the intention of achieving further cost reductions. As well as a delay

<<<

 to the drilling of up to four new wells and hydraulic stimulation of up to two existing wells (in addition to all new wells), the commencement of the onshore compression project will also be delayed. Sterling believes that drilling of the new

<<<

 wells and construction of the onshore compression facilities will now commence in 2017 and has modelled future cash flows and cash balances assuming this starts in the second quarter of that year. On the basis of this analysis, and considering

<<<

 appropriate alternative technical cases, Sterling has identified a need for additional funding of up to USD 40 million including provision for a buffer for operational or financial purposes. As at 31 January 2016, the Group had USD 13.9 million

<<<

 of total cash of which USD 2.2 million was restricted. In the next few months, the Group expects to receive a net refund of Romanian taxes of approximately USD 2.7 million.
For further information on Sterling, an updated company presentation

<<<

 will be posted on Stamdata and the website http://www.sterling-resources.com/.

 of new Bonds until the Super Senior Facility has been repaid in full) and with

repayment through a cash sweep mechanism (commencing in October 2018).

(j)

The entry into a USD 40 million super senior loan facility between the Issuer as borrower

"Inter creditor Agreement"), inter alia giving the Super Senior Facility priority ranking in

<<<

 any matter or

(C) the Majority Super

<<<

<<<

);

(i) any shares which are subject to Transaction Security; or
(ii)

<<<

 assets (other than shares in a member of the Group) with an aggregate book value over £5m,

<<<

 Super Senior Facility Lenders or the Majority Senior Creditors and at the expense of the Debtors, obtain an opinion (a Fairness Opinion) from a Financial Adviser as selected by the Security Agent, that the consideration for the sale is fair

<<<

 from a financial point of view for a prompt and expeditious sale after taking into account all relevant circumstances. The Fairness Opinion shall be delivered within a reasonable period prior to the date of completion of the sale or transfer

<<<

 of the assets referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above.
(c) It is acknowledged that once an administrator, receiver, administrative receiver or other equivalent insolvency official is appointed, they will comply with applicable law in

<<<

 dealing with the assets subject to the Transaction Security and will not be obliged to follow the Security Enforcement Objective.
(d) The Security Agent may (but shall be under no obligation to other than as expressly required under the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement) appoint a Financial Adviser or seek the advice of a Financial Adviser in other circumstances,
(e) The Fairness Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any enforcement that such enforcement

<<<

 of Transaction Security is fair from a financial point of view for a prompt and expeditious sale after taking into account all relevant circumstances) or a Public Auction will each be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective

<<<

 has been met.
(f) Unless the Security Agent receives written notice from a person not part of the Instructing Group that such person objects to any enforcement on the grounds that such enforcement does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement

<<<

 Objective (an Objection), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such enforcement is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective,
(g) If the Security Agent receives an Objection from a Super Senior Creditor or Senior Creditor

<<<

 (in each case, that was not part of the Instructing Group that instructed the Security Agent to take the relevant enforcement action), a Fairness Opinion or a Public Auction will each (without affecting the ability of the Security Agent to

<<<

 rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective) be conclusive evidence that such enforcement action aims to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective.
