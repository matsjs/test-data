1. Background
1.1 As a consequence of the ComeOn acquisition and the expansion into new business areas in recent years, the Issuer is looking to consolidate its group structure and streamline

<<<

 its organisation and also improve its operational flexibility. Through the proposed amendments, the Issuer will be able to streamline and match its business areas with the group's legal structure, which is expected to simplify operations and

<<<

 clarify the group's position as one of the leading Nordic gaming companies. The proposed amendments are also expected to provide the Issuer with operational flexibility required for the group to be able to capitalise on growth opportunities

<<<

 while working to improve its existing business areas. In addition to the consolidation of the group, Cherry also wishes, as a consequence of its objective of increased flexibility, to adjust the covenant structure for the bonds over the coming

<<<

 year. The changes to the group structure was presented to the bondholders in a written procedure dated 22 December 2017 (the "Previous Written Procedure") and were planned to be implemented no later than 31 March 2018. Due to lengthy registration

<<<

 and administrative processes on Malta, the Issuer will not be able to complete its undertakings in the Previous Written Procedure by 31 March 2018.
1.2 The contemplated restructuring (the "Restructuring") includes, amongst other things, that

<<<

:
(a) ComeOn Malta Ltd is transferred to Cherry Malta Ltd. The transfer of the shares in ComeOn Malta Ltd will, for tax reasons, initially be transferred via Cherry Casino Syd AB (subject to the share pledge granted over such shares under the

<<<

 share pledge agreements dated 20 July 2016 and 11 May 2017 with Cherry AB (publ) as pledgor and Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) as Security Agent);
(b) the shares in Play Cherry Ltd are transferred from Cherry Malta Ltd to Roundtable Holding

<<<

 Ltd;
(c) the shares in Cherry Poland Sp.zo.o are transferred from Cherry Malta Ltd to Roundtable Holding Ltd;
(d) the shares in Game Lounge Ltd are transferred or contributed from Cherry Malta Ltd (directly or indirectly) to Game Lounge AB

<<<

, to be held directly by Game Lounge AB or indirectly through a Maltese holding company;
(e) the Interest Cover Ratio Maintenance Test is adjusted from 2.75:1 to 2.25:1 for the period up to 31 December 2018.
2 (9)

1.3 The waivers required

<<<

 to complete the above is to allow the transfer of the shares and a possible deviation from arm's length covenant set out in Clause 14.9 in the Terms and Conditions, all in accordance with the above.
2. Waivers and amendments of the Terms and

<<<

 Conditions
In view of the above and for the purpose of enabling the Issuer to complete the Restructuring, the Issuer hereby kindly requests the Bondholders to consent to the following:
(a) that the Bondholders waive any covenants or undertakings

<<<

 in the pledge agreements listed in paragraph 1.2(a) in order to allow the transfer of the pledged shares;

5.3 Voting rights and authorisation

Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (29 March 2018) in the debt register:

<<<

 Account; or

(b) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.

the

voting

for

the

Bonds.

5 (9)

1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf

2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Bonds through several

<<<

 intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as bondholder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary

<<<

 that is registered in the debt register as a Bondholder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised

<<<

 nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for

<<<

 assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not
