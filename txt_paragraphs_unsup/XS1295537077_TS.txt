RISK FACTORS
The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Bonds. All o f these factors

<<<

 are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring.
Factors which the Issuer believes may be material for the purpose o f assessing the market

<<<

 risks associated with the Bonds are also described below.
The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Bonds, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest, principal or other

<<<

 amounts on or in connection with the Bonds for other reasons, and the Issuer does not represent that the statements below regarding the risks o f holding the Bonds are exhaustive. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information

<<<

 set out elsewhere in this Prospectus (including any documents incorporated by reference herein) and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
Risks that may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under or

<<<

 in connection with the Bonds.
Risksfactors relating to the Issuer and the Group
Slow or negative economic growth may have an adverse effect on the real estate market and the Group's rental revenue
The real estate business is to a large extent

<<<

 affected by macroeconomic factors such as general economic trends, regional economic development, employment rate development, the production rate of new residential units and premises, changes in infrastructure, population growth, structure

<<<

 of the population, inflation and interest rates. The deterioration of economic conditions in either the countries where the Group operates or globally could result in an increase in unemployment or a decline in real income. This may, in turn

<<<

, have an adverse effect on supply and demand in the real estate market, vacancy and rental rates and the financial condition of the Group's tenants and other counterparties.
Expectations regarding inflation and/or fluctuations in inflation

<<<

 rates may affect interest rates, including the interest rates that may be payable by the Group on a finance or credit agreement that it enters into. The cost of interest payments on debts owed to credit institutions is one of the Group's main

<<<

 expenses and so any changes in interest rates could have a significant effect on the Group's financial results and cash flow. Increases in the rate of inflation could also increase the operating and administrative expenses of the Group. Furthermore

<<<

, changes in interest rates and the rate of inflation may also affect the yield requirements and, therefore, the market or fair value of the Group's properties.
If one or several of these factors would develop negatively, it could have a material

<<<

 adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
A decreased demandfor, or an increased supply of, or a contraction o f the marketfor, properties in the countries, in which the Group operates, could adversely affect

<<<

 the business andfinancial condition o f the Group
Supply and demand for real estate, and accordingly the yield on real estate investments differ between different geographical markets and may also develop differently within a specific geographical

<<<

 market. The Group has a diversified property portfolio with properties in a variety of countries and cities. If there are changes in supply and demand or a general contraction of the property market in any of those countries or cities, this

<<<

 may negatively influence the occupancy rates of the Group's properties, the rental rates, the level of demand and ultimately the value of such properties. This could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on the Group's earnings and financial

<<<

 position.
The Group may not be able to execute disposals o f real estate properties and residential units at acceptable prices, on acceptable terms or at all
Part of the Group's business model consists of selling fully developed real estate

<<<

 properties and residential units. For this to be successful, it relies on high demand for such properties and on the ability of the purchasers to successfully complete those transactions.

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 2-

70-40601070

The desire to

<<<

 purchase a real estate property or residential unit is dependent, among other things, on whether the characteristics of the specific property or residential unit correspond to the current market demand, the general activity on the real estate

<<<

 market where the property or unit is based, the general price trend on the real estate market and demographic factors. The desire to purchase residential units is further affected by, among other things, the access to and cost for alternative

<<<

 properties and/or housing arrangements.
The value and price of, and the ability of purchasers to pay for, real estate properties and residential units is influenced by several factors, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, inflation

<<<

 expectations, investor yield requirements, the levels of taxes and charges payable on the acquisition. The ability of counterparties to pay for residential units is further affected by their ability to make interest deductions, receive loan

<<<

 financing, changes in interest rates for residential loans and rules applied by law or credit institutions regarding maximum borrowings and amortisations.
A decrease in purchasers' desire or ability to pay for the real estate properties and

<<<

 residential units or the inability of the Group to sell at acceptable prices could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
There can be no assurance that the Group will be successful in implementing

<<<

 its strategy or achieving its financial targets or investment objectives
No assurance can be given that the implementation of the Group's strategy, and achieving its financial targets or investment objectives, will be successful under current

<<<

 or future market conditions. The Group's approach may be modified and altered from time to time. It is therefore possible that the approach adopted to implement its strategy and achieve its financial targets and investment objectives in the

<<<

 future may be different from that presently expected to be used and disclosed in this Prospectus.
Moreover, the availability of potential investments that meet the Group's acquisition criteria will depend on the state of the economy and financial

<<<

 markets in the countries in which the Group operates. The Group can offer no assurance that it will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with its acquisition criteria or rate of return targets.
The Group is exposed to

<<<

 risks regarding development projects
As part of its business, the Group carries out development projects on its real estate properties. Such projects include the upgrade of its residential units according to the Group's "Better Living" concept

<<<

. The ability to successfully complete these development projects in an economically efficient manner depends on a number of factors, including the ability of the Group to retain and recruit personnel with necessary competence within the construction

<<<

, project management, design, architecture and sales fields, to obtain necessary permits and decisions from local and/or regional authorities and to hire contractors that will implement projects on terms that are acceptable to the Group.
When

<<<

 considering development project investments and development risks, the Group needs to make an estimate of the economic and market conditions that will prevail in the market where the project is located at the time the project is completed and

<<<

 becomes operational, and there is uncertainty at the beginning of a development project about the economic and market conditions at the time of completion of the project. Such estimates are difficult to make since it takes a considerable time

<<<

 before development projects are completed and become operational. During this time, economic conditions may change unfavourably and lower the Group's expected return on the investment. For example, a given market may experience an oversupply

<<<

 of residential properties at the time of a project's completion, leading to lower occupancy rates. As a result, the Group may incorrectly time its development project investments and adopt an inappropriate business strategy.
There are also

<<<

 technical risks associated with such development projects. These include risks of constructional defects, other concealed defects or deficiencies, damage and contaminations. If technical problems do occur, it could result in delays in scheduled

<<<

 real estate development projects, or increased costs for upgrade and management of the Group's properties. Technical problems could also arise from the actions or omissions of third parties and may not be known to the Group. Although the Group

<<<

 may have rights against the building contractor and/or professional team in connection with such defects and/or recourse to insurance in place for the project in question, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to enforce its

<<<

 rights and fully recover the costs arising from any claim against the Group.

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 3-

70-40601070

Furthermore, the Group may not be able to obtain the necessary decisions or permits from local and/or regional authorities that

<<<

 are required to implement a change in the use of acquired properties and changes in permits, plans, planning laws or regulations may result in delays in construction works or other unforeseen delays, increases in the cost of construction and

<<<

 construction materials, cost overruns or the failure to complete the Group's real estate development projects.
If one or several of the above factors would develop negatively or if any of the above described risks would materialise, it could

<<<

 have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Group's operating, maintenance and administrative costs may be higher than expected
The Group's operating expenses mainly consist of ongoing electricity

<<<

, cleaning, water and heating costs associated with its properties. Depending on the geographic market where a property is based, a number of these services can only be purchased from a single operator, and this may lead to periodic increases

<<<

 in the prices for such services. To the extent any of such increases in costs cannot be passed onto the Group's tenants through regulation in lease agreements, or rental increases through renegotiations of lease agreements, it may have a negative

<<<

 impact on the Group's earnings and financial position.
Maintenance expenses result from the measures taken by the Group in order to maintain the standard of its properties in the long term. As properties age, they generally require greater

<<<

 maintenance, refurbishment and redevelopment costs. Numerous factors, including the age of the relevant building, the material and substances used at the time of its construction could result in substantial unbudgeted costs for refurbishment

<<<

 and modernisation. If the Group does not carry out maintenance, refurbishment and redevelopment activities with respect to its properties, these properties may become less attractive to tenants and the Group's rental income may decrease, thereby

<<<

 adversely affecting the Group's business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. These maintenance expenditures are accounted for as expenses to the extent they relate to repairs and replacements of minor items. In addition

<<<

 to pure maintenance costs, costs for refurbishments in advance of rent renewals or re-lettings normally arise. Unexpected and extensive renovation needs and expenditures may have an adverse impact on the Group's earnings and financial position

<<<

.
Other factors which could increase operating, maintenance and administrative expenses include, amongst others, increases relating to the rate of inflation, payroll expenses, legal expenses, property taxes and other statutory charges, energy

<<<

 costs and cost of services provided by third party providers; movements in foreign exchange rates and increases in insurance premiums. Any such increases may have an adverse effect on the Group's earnings and financial position.
The Group is

<<<

 subject to credit and counterparty risks
The Group is subject to the counterparty risk of its tenants as the net revenue generated from the Group's properties depends on the financial stability of its tenants. The creditworthiness of a tenant

<<<

 can decline over the short or medium term, leading to a risk that the tenant will become insolvent or unable to pay its agreed rents in a timely manner or otherwise unable to meet its obligations under the lease. If a lease is terminated, the

<<<

 Group may be unable to re-let the property for rent previously received or at all. The Group is also exposed to the counterparty risk of purchasers to the extent that they fail to make payments for the properties in relation to which the Group

<<<

 has entered into an agreement for their sale. The realisation of these risks could have a negative impact on the Group's earnings and financial position.
In addition to the credit risks associated with its tenants/purchasers, the Group is exposed

<<<

 to credit risks relating to its financial operations. Such credit risks arise in connection with, among other things, investments of excess liquidity, entering into interest swap agreements and when obtaining long-term and short-term credit

<<<

 agreements. If the counterparties in these operations cannot fulfil their obligations towards the Group, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
Interest rate risks may reduce the

<<<

 Group's net return
Aside from equity contributions, the Group's operations are largely financed by borrowings, including loans from credit institutions and listed bonds and, as a result, the cost of interest payments on such debts is one of

<<<

 the Group's main expenses. Changes in interest rates can affect the Group's profitability by

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 4-

70-40601070

affecting the spread between, among other things, the income on its assets and the expense of its interest bearing

<<<

 liabilities, the value of any interest-earning assets, its ability to make acquisitions and its ability to realise gains from the sale of its assets. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including the expected inflation

<<<

 rate, governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, fiscal deficits, regulatory requirements and other factors beyond the Group's control. The short-term interest rates are mainly

<<<

 determined by reference to the respective national bank's repo rate, which is a monetary policy rate. In times of increasing inflation expectations, the interest rate can be expected to increase and in times of decreasing inflation expectations

<<<

, the interest rate can be expected to decrease.
The Group's interest costs are mainly affected by the current market interest rate, the margin imposed by credit institutions and the method for determining the rate of interest on the debts entered

<<<

 into by the Group. As at 30 June 2015, the loans of the Group carried an average interest rate of 3.56 per cent. and the average interest rate hedge was 3.9 years. As at 30 June 2015, 32 per cent. of the Group's borrowings carried interest

<<<

 at a floating rate. With respect to fixed rate debt, a longer average fixed interest term on the Group's debts means that the Group is tied to a fixed interest rate that may or may not be in line with the prevailing market interest rate. With

<<<

 respect to floating rate debt, the Group's floating rate loan expenses may increase with a rise in market interest rates. An increase in interest rates may increase the Group's interest expense and this could have a material adverse impact

<<<

 on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Group may not be able to securefinancing in thefuture
The Group is exposed to the risk of not being able to obtain new financing or to re-finance existing debt obligations. In

<<<

 addition, the terms and conditions on which future funding or re-financing may be made available may not be acceptable to the Group. As at 30 June 2015, the Issuer's interest-bearing debt amounted to a total of SEK 33,521 million. There is

<<<

 a risk that these lenders in the future do not want or have the possibility to continue with the current financing.
During the financial crisis in 2008-2009, there was severe volatility and disturbance in the financial and credit markets, with

<<<

 decreased liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for many credit institutions. Even though the Group currently believes that its refinancing risk is small, there is no guarantee that future refinancing can be obtained on commercially

<<<

 acceptable terms, and this could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Group's inability to procure sufficient financing for its property acquisitions or development projects could adversely

<<<

 affect its ability to expand its business and may result in unexpected costs for the Group. If such circumstances occur, it could also result in development projects not being completed before the Group's loan repayments are due, or that such

<<<

 increased costs in the development project not being covered by the credit facilities in place. If the Group is not able to obtain new financing with respect to its property acquisitions or development projects, or an extension or increase

<<<

 of existing financing arrangements, or is only able to obtain such financing on terms that are disadvantageous, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Group may be forced to refinance

<<<

 its debt or may forfeit secured assets i f it fails to meet the obligations and requirements under its loan agreements and debt securities
The Group is financed from a variety of sources. In total, the Group has loans with 34 banks in different

<<<

 countries and it has issued two listed bonds.
The Group has provided security and guarantees for a large proportion of its loans. As at 30 June 2015, the Group had total borrowings, including bonds and bank loans, with a nominal value of SEK

<<<

 33,521 million, of which SEK 29,082 million was secured. As at 30 June 2015, the market value of the Group's properties secured in favour of external creditors was SEK 59,126 million. Some of the loan agreements and terms of the bonds contain

<<<

 financial covenants which, among other things, cover (i) the ownership of the company that has raised the loan and (ii) the Group's equity ratio and certain other financial ratios. In this context, it should be noted that some of the Group

<<<

's financial ratios, at least in the short term, are negatively affected when a company within the Group acquires properties which are financed through loans from external creditors. Accordingly, such acquisitions (which constitute a part of

<<<

 the Group's business model) could increase the Group's risk of breaching such financial covenants. If any of the financial covenants set out in the loan agreements and the terms of the bonds are breached, it could result

181772-4-4-v22.0


<<<


- 5-

70-40601070

in the acceleration of the loans and/or bonds and/or the realisation of the security granted to the relevant credit institutions, which could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and

<<<

 financial position.
Liquidity risks
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its payment obligations under its financing arrangements without its cost for obtaining cash increasing significantly. If the Group's liquidity sources

<<<

 prove not to be sufficient, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Group is also exposed to risks arising from the illiquidity of its portfolio The market for the types of properties

<<<

 the Group owns or may acquire in the future is generally illiquid. Were the Group required to liquidate parts of its portfolio on short notice for any reason, including raising funds to support its operations or repay outstanding indebtedness

<<<

, the Group may not be able to sell any portion of its portfolio on favourable terms or at all. In the case of an accelerated sale, there may be a significant shortfall between the fair value of the property and the price at which the Group

<<<

 could sell such property. In planned disposals in the ordinary course of business, an illiquid market may result in a sales price that is lower than anticipated or in a delay of the sale. Any such shortfall could have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Group. In addition, the Group may be subject to restrictions on its ability to sell properties pursuant to covenants and pledges limiting asset disposals in the Group's financing

<<<

 agreements.
Change o f control
In some of the Group's financing agreements there may be provisions which are triggered by a change of control of the Group's companies. Upon such changes, certain rights of the counterparty, or obligations for

<<<

 the Group, may arise which among other things could impact the Group's financing arrangements. If the Group's financing arrangements are affected, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position

<<<

.
Changes in value o f the Group's interest rate derivatives could have an adverse impact on the Group's financial position
A number of the Group's credit agreements bear interest at a floating rate. The Group uses interest rate derivatives

<<<

, mainly interest rate swaps, to hedge against the interest rate risk. The interest rate derivatives are accounted for in the balance sheet at actual value and the changes in value are accounted for in the income statement. As the market interest

<<<

 rate changes, this results in a theoretical over or under value on the interest rate derivatives, which does not affect the cash flow. At the maturity date of the relevant credit agreement, the value of the derivatives is always zero. The derivatives

<<<

 provide hedging against increased interest rates, but the market value of the Group's interest rate derivatives decreases if the market interest rates decrease, which has an adverse impact on the Group's financial position.
The Group is exposed

<<<

 to currencies not denominated in Swedish Krona ("Foreign Currency") exchange rate fluctuations, and there can be no assurance that its Foreign Currency hedging strategy will be effective.
The Group is subject to fluctuations in Foreign Currency

<<<

 exchange rates as a consequence of the revenues of its property-owning subsidiaries being denominated in currencies other than the Swedish Krona. The Group may enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes to mitigate risks resulting

<<<

 from fluctuations in Foreign Currency exchange rates. Hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honour their obligations under these arrangements. The funds required to settle such arrangements could

<<<

 be significant depending on the stability and movement of foreign currency. There can be no assurance that its Foreign Currency hedging strategy will be effective or that, when such derivative transactions expire, they could be renewed on acceptable

 terms or at all.
As a result, the Group's financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected by hedged and unhedged Foreign Currency fluctuations if the Group is required to exchange a Foreign Currency to Swedish

<<<

 Krona (for financial reporting purposes or on a cash basis), in particular from Sterling, Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar or Euro to Swedish Krona, at a time when Foreign Currency

<<<

, and it has not been able to enter into appropriate hedging arrangements in respect thereof.
Changes in value o f the Group's real estate properties
The Group's real estate properties are accounted for in the balance sheet at actual value and

<<<

 the changes in value are accounted for in the income statement. Non-realised value changes do not affect the cash flow. The value of the properties is affected by a number of factors, partly property specific such as vacancy rate, the rental

<<<

 level and operating costs, and partly market specific such as yield requirements and cost of capital derived from comparable transactions on the real estate market. Both property specific deteriorations such as lower rental levels and increased

<<<

 vacancy rate and market specific deteriorations such as higher yield requirements may cause the Group to write-down the actual value of its properties which could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial

<<<

 position.
The Group is subject to acquisition, sale and other transactional risks in relation to its real estate properties
Transactions relating to real estate properties involve uncertainties and risks for the Group. Acquisitions of properties

<<<

 involve, for instance, uncertainties regarding the management of new tenants, unexpected costs with respect to environmental clean-up, rebuilding and the handling of technical problems, decisions from authorities and the emergence of disputes

<<<

 relating to the acquisition or the condition of the real estate property. Such uncertainties may result in delays in the Group's development projects for the acquired properties or increased or unexpected costs for the real estate properties

<<<

 or transactions.
The sale of real estate properties by the Group also involves uncertainties regarding, for instance, the ability to successfully dispose of the relevant properties at acceptable prices and the fact that the Group may be subject

<<<

 to contractual claims by purchasers in respect of the properties sold. Also, in the case of an accelerated sale, there may be a significant shortfall between the fair value of the property and the price at which the Group could sell such property

<<<

.
If any of the above described risks would materialise, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Group intends to selectively acquire additional real estate assets in the future

<<<

, but it may overestimate the potential o f such assets, over pay for such assets, not identify all potential liabilities or be unable to obtain relevant clearances to complete the acquisition
The acquisition of real estate requires, among other

<<<

 things, an analysis that is subject to a wide variety of factors, including subjective assessments and assumptions. It is possible that the Group may overestimate the potential of a real estate asset when making acquisition decisions or may

<<<

 base its decision on inaccurate information or assumptions that turn out to be incorrect. For example, the Group may overestimate the attractiveness of a property or its location, or the demand for such premises, in which case it may be difficult

<<<

 to find suitable tenants that are willing to enter into favourable leases. The Group may also underestimate the likelihood that a newly acquired real estate asset will require substantial renovation or capital repairs. Such errors may only

<<<

 become apparent at a later stage and force the Group to recognise fair value losses on its statement of financial position and income statement.
Furthermore, the Group cannot guarantee that its due diligence when acquiring a real estate asset

<<<

 will uncover all the potential liabilities and risks related to the property (such as construction defects) or that it will have recourse to the seller of the property for the non-disclosure of such risks. Official information in the land register

<<<

 of some of the countries in which the Group has its operations or assets may not be accurate and complete. Thus, although the Group may have to rely upon the information contained in land registers, it may not have effective redress against

<<<

 the government of the relevant country if the information upon which the Group relied in deciding whether or not to make an investment was inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.
Operational risks
Operational risk is the risk of incurring losses

<<<

 due to inadequate systems or policies relating to, among other things, internal control, administration, competence development and access to reliable valuation and risk models. If the Group's systems or policies are not adequate, there is

<<<

 a risk that the Group may

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 7-

70-40601070

incur losses which could have a material negative impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Group relies on certain key personnel, the loss o f whom

<<<

 could have an adverse impact on its business
The Group's business is dependent, among other things, on the expertise of a number of key personnel, including senior executives and persons with specialist competence. These key persons have extensive

<<<

 experience and competence regarding real estate development and real estate transactions and have, through their experience, established strong relationships with participants on the real estate market and the Group's creditors. Accordingly

<<<

, retaining these key persons is important to ensure a successful development in the Group's business. The unexpected loss of some or all of these individuals could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial

<<<

 position.
The Group has a number of employees whose knowledge, experience and commitment is of importance for the Group's future development. There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to retain all of its existing personnel or to

<<<

 attract additional qualified personnel when needed which, in turn, could affect adversely the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Groupfaces competition from existing and new market participants
The Group operates in a

<<<

 competitive market. The Group's competitors may have significant resources and in-depth knowledge of the geographical markets in which the Group operates. The Group's ability to successfully compete with existing and new market participants

<<<

 is, among other things, dependent upon the Group's ability to anticipate future market changes and trends, and to rapidly react to existing and future market needs. Competition may result in increased costs or require price reductions or changes

<<<

 to the Group's business model. Therefore, the Group may be forced to make costly investments, reorganisations or price reductions to adapt to a new competitive environment. Increased competition from existing and new market participants could

<<<

 have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
Changes in laws and the failure to receive permits or be granted decisions by local/regional authorities could affect the Group's properties
The Group

<<<

's business is regulated and affected by a large number of laws and regulations as well as various processes and decisions relating to these regulations, both on a political level and on an administrative level. Such laws and regulations include

<<<

 the Swedish Planning and Building Act (Sw: Plan- och bygglagen) (or similar legislation in any jurisdiction where the Group is carrying out its business), building standards, health and safety regulations, security regulations, construction

<<<

 codes, listed buildings classification and classification of buildings with cultural significance. These laws and regulations can have a material impact on the Group's business as well as the costs of, and opportunities for the Group to develop

<<<

 its properties in accordance with its business model. Even if the Group's business is conducted in accordance with its interpretation of the current laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that the Group's interpretation of laws and

<<<

 regulations is correct, or that the interpretations may change in the future. In addition, the implementation of new laws or regulations in other countries in which the Group currently operates, or may operate in the future, or the interpretation

<<<

 or enforcement of, or change in, existing laws or regulations, may require the Group to incur additional costs or may prevent the Group from using or developing the Group's properties in accordance with its business model.
In order for the

<<<

 Group's properties to be used and developed in accordance with its business model, various permits and decisions may be required, including local plans and a variety of property registrations, which are approved and given by local/regional

<<<

 authorities. There is a risk that the Group may not in the future be granted the permits or obtain the decisions necessary to conduct and develop its business in a desired manner. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that positive decisions

<<<

 or permits for the Group will not be challenged by third parties which would lead to further delays in Group's operations, or that the established decision-making practice, political will or direction in the future will not change in an adverse

<<<

 manner for the Group.
If any of the above described risks would materialise, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.

181772-4-4-v22.0

70-40601070

The Group may incur environmental

<<<

 liabilities or compliance costs
The environmental laws of certain countries in which the Group has its operations or assets impose actual and potential obligations to conduct remedial action on sites contaminated with hazardous or toxic substances

<<<

. In such circumstances, the owner's liability is generally not limited under such laws and the costs of any required removal, investigation or remediation can be substantial. The presence of such substances on, or in, any of the Group's properties

<<<

, or the liability for failure to remedy property contamination from such substances, could adversely affect the Group's ability to let or sell such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral, which could have an effect on

<<<

 its generation of rental income or return on investment which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.
Finally, the Group may be required to comply with stricter

<<<

 environmental laws, regulations and requirements which could result in increased costs for the Group with respect to cleaning-up or after treatment of its current or future properties. Such changes could also result in increased costs or delays

<<<

 for the Group with respect to its real estate development projects. In addition, if the relevant authorities in a country where the Group operates discover violations of applicable environmental laws, the Group may be subject to fines and other

<<<

 penalties.
If any of the above risks materialise, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
The Group is exposed to risks relating to changes in applicable tax laws and regulations
The

<<<

 Group's operations are affected by the tax rules in force from time to time in the jurisdictions where the Group conducts operations or has assets. These rules include corporate tax, real estate tax, value added tax, rules regarding tax-free

<<<

 disposals of shares, other governmental or municipal taxes and interest deductions and subsidies. The Group's tax situation is also affected by transactions conducted intra-Group and by transactions between the Group and residential co-operatives

<<<

 that are considered to be priced on market terms. Although the Group's business is conducted in accordance with the its interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations, and in accordance with advice the Group has received from its tax

<<<

 advisors, it cannot be excluded the possibility that the Group's interpretation is incorrect, or that such laws and regulations change, possibly with retroactive effect. Furthermore, future changes in applicable laws and regulations may affect

<<<

 the conditions of the business of the Group. In this respect, it can be noted that the modified tax model proposed by the Swedish Corporate Taxation Committee (Sw: Foretagsskattekommitten) in an Official Report (SOU 2014:40) published on 1

<<<

2 June 2014 is being revised and new rules on, inter alia, limitations on deductions of interest costs and other financial costs may be introduced at the earliest on 1 January 2017. If new rules are introduced, they may limit the Group's ability

<<<

 to obtain tax deductions in this respect. There is also potential new legislation under consideration limiting the number of tax-exempt disposals of shares in real estate companies and extending the number of transactions which may attract

<<<

 stamp duty. There can be no assurance that tax rates will not be increased in the future or that other changes in the tax laws/regulations occur which affect the ownership of real estate properties or real estate transactions. If any of the

<<<

 above described risks would materialise, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
Rental regulations may restrict the Group's ability to increase rents and may have a negative impact

<<<

 on general market rental rates which in turn may affect the valuation o f the Group's properties
The ability of the Group to increase rents under its tenancy agreements may be limited by applicable rent regulations in the jurisdictions in which

<<<

 the Group's properties are located. For example, in the Kingdom of Sweden, the system of "utility value" (Sw: Bruksvardessystemet) implies that rent levels should be proportionate to the quality and standard of the residential unit in question

<<<

 and can only be increased to a level that is in line with the rent that is charged on other comparable residential units (in other words, rents can only be subject to more significant above-inflation increases when the residential units have

<<<

 been upgraded). For a general description of the rental regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, please see "Description o f the Issuer and the Group - Rental Regulations". In the context of the Group's development

<<<

 projects that relate to the upgrade of the Group's properties according to the Group's "Better Living" concept, to the extent that the Group is or becomes restricted by applicable rental regulations from increasing the rent payable on such

<<<

 upgraded properties, this could have a material impact on the Group's ability to recover the costs and expenses associated with the upgrade of those

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 9-

70-40601070

residential units and this could, in turn, have a material

<<<

 impact on the Group's operations, earnings and/or and financial condition. While rental regulations can contribute to a more stable income relating to rents, the further tightening of any applicable rental regulations in a specific market could

<<<

 have a negative impact on the market rental rates payable in that market. Any general decreases in the rental levels of the Group's properties as a result of decreases in market rental rates could have a negative effect on the value of the

<<<

 Group's properties and this, in turn, could have a material impact on the growth and financial prospects of the Group.
The Group's insurance coverage may be inadequate
The Group's insurance policies may not cover all losses and, as a result

<<<

, the Group's insurance may not fully compensate it for losses associated with damage to its real estate assets. In addition, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, terrorism

<<<

 or acts of war, that may be uninsurable or that are not economically insurable. Other factors might also result in insurance proceeds being insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed, such as inflation, taxation

<<<

, changes in building codes and ordinances and environmental considerations. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, the Group could lose capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future revenue

<<<

 from that property. In addition, it could be liable to repair damage caused by uninsured risks. The Group may also remain liable for any debt or other financial obligation related to that damaged property.
The risk of litigation is inherent

<<<

 in the Group's operations
Legal and regulatory actions, claims against the Group and arbitrations involving the Group may arise in the ordinary course of business. The Group may be subject to litigation from suppliers, tenants or third parties

<<<

, including visitors to properties owned by the Group. Such actions or claims could be time consuming and result in costs (the size of which cannot always be foreseen) and negative publicity. Litigation could, therefore, have a material adverse

<<<

 impact on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
Changed accounting rules
The Group's business is affected by the accounting rules that, from time to time, are applied in the jurisdictions where the Group conducts business

<<<

 or has assets, including for example the international financial reporting standards ("IFRS") and other international accounting rules. This means that the Group's accounting, financial reporting and internal control, may in the future be affected

<<<

 by and may have to be adapted to such amended accounting rules or a changed application of such accounting rules. This might entail uncertainty regarding the Group's accounting, financial reporting and internal control and might also affect

<<<

 the Group's accounted earnings, balance sheet and equity, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's operations, earnings and financial position.
Risks related to the Bonds
The Bonds will constitute unsecured obligations of the

<<<

 Issuer
The Issuer's obligations under the Bonds will be unsecured. Accordingly, any claims against the Issuer under the Bonds would be unsecured claims. The Issuer's ability to pay such claims will depend upon, among other factors, its liquidity

<<<

, overall financial strength and ability to generate cash flows, which could be affected by (inter alia) the circumstances described in these risk factors. Any such factors could affect the Issuer's ability to make payment of interest and principal

<<<

 under the Bonds.
Claims o f Bondholders under the Bonds are effectively subordinated to those o f certain other creditors o f the Issuer and to creditors o f the Issuer's subsidiaries
The Bonds are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations o

<<<

 f the Issuer. The Bonds will rank equally with all of the Issuer's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness; however, the Bonds will be effectively subordinated to the Issuer's secured indebtedness and securitisations, if any, to the

<<<

 extent of the value of the assets securing such transactions, and will be subject to certain preferential obligations under Swedish law, such as wages o f employees.
Generally, lenders and trade and other creditors of the Issuer's subsidiaries

<<<

 are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets would be available for distribution to the

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 10-

70-40601070

Issuer, as direct or indirect shareholder, which would then

<<<

 allow for the Issuer to make payments under the Bonds. Any debt that the Issuer's subsidiaries may incur in the future will also rank structurally senior to the Bonds.
A significant part of the Group's assets and revenues are generated by the

<<<

 Issuer's subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are legally separated from the Issuer and the subsidiaries' ability to make payments to the Issuer is restricted by, among other things, the availability of funds, corporate restrictions and local law

<<<

. Furthermore, in the event of insolvency, liquidation or a similar event relating to one of the subsidiaries, all creditors of such subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full out of the assets of such subsidiary before any entity within

<<<

 the Group, as a shareholder, would be entitled to any payments. Thus, the Bonds are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Issuer.
There is no public trading market for the Bonds and an active trading market

<<<

 may not develop or be sustained in thefuture
There is no active trading market for investments in the Bonds. If investments in the Bonds are traded after their initial issuance, then they might trade at a discount to their initial offering

<<<

 price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and the Issuer's financial condition. Although application has been made for the Bonds to be listed on the Official List maintained

<<<

 by the Irish Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Main Securities Market, there can be no assurance that such application will be accepted, that an active trading market will develop or, if developed, that it can be sustained

<<<

. If an active trading market for investments in the Bonds does not develop or is not maintained, then the market or trading price and liquidity of investments in the Bonds may be adversely affected.
The Bonds are subject to optional redemption

<<<

 by the Issuer
The option for the Issuer to redeem the Bonds at any time (see ""Terms and Conditions o f the BondsRedemption at the Option o f the Issuer") is likely to limit the market value of Bonds. The market value of the Bonds generally

<<<

 will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed.
The Issuer may be expected to redeem Bonds when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Bonds. At those times, an investor generally would not be

<<<

 able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Bonds being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk

<<<

 in light of other investments available at that time.
The market price o f the Bonds is subject to a high degree o f volatility
The market price of investments in the Bonds could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to actual

<<<

 or anticipated variations in the Issuer's operating results, adverse business developments, changes to the regulatory environment in which the Issuer operates, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and the actual or expected

<<<

 sale by the Issuer of other debt securities, as well as other factors, including the trading market for notes issued by the Kingdom of Sweden. In addition, in recent years the global financial markets have experienced significant price and

<<<

 volume fluctuations that, if repeated in the future, could adversely affect the market price of investments in the Bonds without regard to the Issuer's financial condition or results of operations.
The Bonds may not be a suitable investmentfor

<<<

 all investors
Each potential investor in any Bonds must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:
(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful

<<<

 evaluation of the Bonds, the merits and risks of investing in the Bonds and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context

<<<

 of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Bonds and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 11-

70-40601070

(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity

<<<

 to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Bonds, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Bonds and be familiar with

<<<

 the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and
(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment

<<<

 and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks
In addition to the ratings on the Bonds to be provided by S&P, one or more other independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Bonds

<<<

. The ratings might not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market and other factors that may affect the value of the Bonds. Credit ratings assigned to the Bonds do not necessarily mean that they are a suitable investment

<<<

. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organisation. Similar ratings on different types of notes do not necessarily mean

<<<

 the same thing. The initial ratings by S&P will not address the likelihood that the principal on the Bonds will be prepaid or paid on the scheduled maturity date. Such ratings also will not address the marketability of investments in the Bonds

<<<

 or any market price. Any change in the credit ratings of the Bonds or the Issuer could adversely affect the price that a subsequent purchaser will be willing to pay for investments in the Bonds. The significance of each rating should be analysed

<<<

 independently from any other rating.
Modification and Waivers
The conditions of the Bonds contain provisions for calling meetings of Bondholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit Bondholders holding

<<<

 defined percentages of Bonds to bind all Bondholders, including Bondholders who did not vote at the relevant meeting and Bondholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority. The conditions of the Bonds and the Trust Deed also provide

<<<

 that the Trustee may, without the consent of Bondholders, agree to any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the conditions of the Bonds or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed see

<<<

 "Terms and Conditions o f the Bonds - Meetings o f Bondholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution".
Investors in the Bonds must rely on Euroclear and Clearstream procedures
The Bonds will be represented on issue by a Global Certificate

<<<

 that will be delivered to a common safekeeper for, and registered in the name of a common nominee of, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in the Global Certificate, investors will not be entitled to

<<<

 receive Bonds in definitive form. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Certificate. While the Bonds are represented by the Global Certificate

<<<

, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants.
The Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Bonds by making payments to or to

<<<

 the order of the common safekeeper for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg for distribution to their account holders. A holder of a beneficial interest in the Global Certificate must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg

<<<

 to receive payments under the Bonds. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in the Global Certificate.
Holders of beneficial interests in the Global Certificate

<<<

 will not have a direct right to vote in respect of the Bonds. Instead, such holders will be permitted to act only to the extent that they are enabled by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to appoint appropriate proxies. Similarly, holders

<<<

 of beneficial interests in the Global Certificate will not have a direct right under the Global Certificate to take enforcement action against the Issuer in the event of a default under the Bonds but will have to rely upon their rights under

<<<

 the Trust Deed.

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 12-

70-40601070

The Issuer may create and issuefurther Bonds
The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Bondholders create and issue further Bonds, having terms and conditions that are

<<<

 the same as those of the Bonds, or the same except for the amount of the first payment of interest, which new Bonds may be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding Bonds even if doing so may adversely affect the value of the

<<<

 original Bonds.
A change in English law which governs the Bonds may adversely affect Bondholders
The Terms and Conditions of the Bonds are governed by English law in effect as at the date of issue of the Bonds. No assurance can be given as

<<<

 to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English law or administrative practice after the date of issue of the Bonds.
Integral multiples o f 100,000
The denomination of the Bonds is 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,0

<<<

00 in excess thereof. Therefore, it is possible that the Bonds may be traded in amounts in excess of 100,000 that are not integral multiples of 1,000. In such a case, a Bondholder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds a principal amount

<<<

 of less than 100,000 will not receive a definitive Bond in respect of such holding (should definitive Bonds be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Bonds such that it holds an amount equal to one or more denominations.

<<<


Fixed rate bonds are exposed to specific market risks
The Bonds will bear a fixed interest rate of 3.375 per cent. per annum. A holder of a security with a fixed interest rate is exposed to the risk that the price of such security falls as

<<<

 a result of changes in the current interest rate on the capital markets (the "Market Interest Rate"). While the nominal rate of a security with a fixed interest rate is fixed for a specified period, the Market Interest Rate typically changes

<<<

 on a daily basis. As the Market Interest Rate changes, the price of such security is likely to change in the opposite direction. If the Market Interest Rate increases, the price of such security typically falls, until the yield of such security

<<<

 is approximately equal to the Market Interest Rate. If the Market Interest Rate falls, the price of a security with a fixed compensation rate typically increases, until the yield of such security is approximately equal to the Market Interest

<<<

 Rate. Investors should be aware that movements of the Market Interest Rate can adversely affect the price of the Bonds and can lead to losses for the Bondholders if they sell the Bonds.
Exchange rate risks and exchange controls may result in

<<<

 investors receiving less interest or principal than expected
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Bonds in euros. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated

<<<

 principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than euros. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of euros or revaluation of the Investor's Currency

<<<

) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Inventor's Currency relative to euros would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency equivalent

<<<

 yield on the Bonds, (2) the Investor's Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Bonds and (3) the Investor's Currency equivalent market value of the Bonds. Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in

<<<

 the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
Inflation risk
The value of future payments of interest

<<<

 and principal may be reduced as a result of inflation as the real rate of interest on an investment in the Bonds will be reduced at rising inflation rates and may be negative if the inflation rate rises above the nominal rate of interest on

<<<

 the Bonds.
Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments.
The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential

<<<

 investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (i) the Bonds are legal investments for it, (ii) the Bonds can be used

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 13-

70-40601070

as collateral for various types of borrowing and

<<<

 (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Bonds. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Bonds under any applicable risk-based

<<<

 capital or similar rules.
EU Savings Directive
EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the "Savings Directive") requires EU Member States to provide to the tax authorities of other EU Member States details of payments

<<<

 of interest and other similar income paid by a person established within its jurisdiction to (or secured by such a person for the benefit of) an individual resident, or to (or secured for) certain other types of entity established, in that

<<<

 other EU Member State, except that Austria will instead impose a withholding system for a transitional period (subject to a procedure whereby, on meeting certain conditions, the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that

<<<

 no tax be withheld) unless during such period it elects otherwise.
The Council of the European Union has adopted a Directive (the "Amending Savings Directive") which would, when implemented, amend and broaden the scope of the requirements of

<<<

 the Savings Directive described above, including by expanding the range of payments covered by the Savings Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities, and by expanding the circumstances in which payments

<<<

 must be reported or paid subject to withholding. For example, payments made to (or secured for) (i) an entity or legal arrangement effectively managed in an EU Member State that is not subject to effective taxation, or (ii) a person, entity

<<<

 or legal arrangement established or effectively managed outside of the EU (and outside any third country or territory that has adopted similar measures to the Savings Directive) which indirectly benefit an individual resident in an EU Member

<<<

 State, may fall within the scope of the Savings Directive, as amended. The Amending Savings Directive requires EU Member States to adopt national legislation necessary to comply with it by 1 January 2016, which legislation must apply from 

<<<

1 January 2017.
The European Commission has published a proposal for a Council Directive repealing the Savings Directive from 1 January 2016 (1 January 2017 in the case of Austria) (in each case subject to transitional arrangements). The proposal

<<<

 also provides that, if it is adopted, EU Member States will not be required to implement the Amending Savings Directive.
If a payment were to be made or collected through an EU Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount

<<<

 of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment pursuant to the Savings Directive or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or

<<<

 any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to such Directive, neither the Issuer nor any Paying Agent nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Bond as a result of the

<<<

 imposition of such withholding tax. Furthermore, if the Amending Savings Directive is implemented and takes effect in EU Member States, such withholding may occur in a wider range of circumstances than at present, as explained above.
The Issuer

<<<

 is required to maintain a Registrar with a specified office in an EU Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to any law implementing the Savings Directive or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the

<<<

 ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000. However, investors should be aware that any custodians or intermediaries through which they hold their interest in the Bonds may nonetheless be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to such

<<<

 laws unless the investor meets certain conditions, including providing any information that may be necessary to enable such persons to make payments free from withholding and in compliance with the Savings Directive, as amended.
Investors who

Payments on the Bonds may be subject to U.S. withholding tax under FATCA
The United States has enacted rules, commonly referred to

 as "FATCA", that generally impose a new reporting and withholding regime with respect to certain payments made after 31 December 2016 by entities that are classified as financial institutions under FATCA. The United States has entered into

 an intergovernmental agreement regarding the implementation of FATCA with the Kingdom of Sweden (the

 to the Bonds to be subject to withholding under FATCA. However, significant aspects of when and how FATCA will apply remain unclear, and no assurance can be given that withholding under FATCA will not become relevant with respect to payments

 made on or with respect to the Bonds in the future. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of FATCA.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE BONDS

The following are the terms and conditions substantially in the form in which they will be endorsed on

<<<

 the Bonds:

The issue of the 300,000,000 3.375 per cent. Bonds due 2020 (the "Bonds") was authorised by resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Issuer passed on 9 June 2015 and 14 September 2015. The Bonds are constituted by a trust deed

<<<

 (the "Trust Deed") dated 23 September 2015 (as may be amended, supplemented and/or replaced) between the Issuer and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited (the "Trustee" which expression shall include all persons for the time being the trustee or

<<<

 trustees under the Trust Deed) as trustee for the holders of the Bonds. These terms and conditions include summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed provisions of the Trust Deed, which includes the form of the Bonds. Copies of the Trust

<<<

 Deed, and of the agency agreement (the "Agency Agreement") dated 23 September 2015 (as may be amended, supplemented and/or replaced) relating to the Bonds between the Issuer, the Trustee, the registrar (the "Registrar"), any transfer agents

<<<

 (each a "Transfer Agent"), the initial principal paying agent and any other agents named in it, are available for inspection and collection during usual business hours at the principal office of the Trustee (presently at Winchester House, 

<<<

1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB) and at the specified offices of the principal paying agent for the time being (the "Principal Paying Agent"), the Registrar and any Transfer Agents. "Agents" means the Principal Paying Agent, the Registrar

<<<

, the Transfer Agents and any other agent or agents appointed from time to time with respect to the Bonds. The Bondholders are entitled to the benefit of, are bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the Trust Deed and

<<<

 are deemed to have notice of those applicable to them of the Agency Agreement.

All capitalised terms that are not defined in these terms and conditions (the "Conditions") will have the meanings given to them in the Trust Deed.

1.

Form, Specified

<<<

 Denomination and Title

The Bonds are issued in the specified denomination of 100,000 and higher integral multiples of 1,000.

The Bonds are represented by registered certificates ("Certificates") and, save as provided in Condition 2(a), each

<<<

 Certificate shall represent the entire holding of Bonds by the same holder.

Title to the Bonds shall pass by registration in the register that the Issuer shall procure to be kept by the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of the Agency

<<<

 Agreement (the "Register"). Except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or as required by law, the holder (as defined below) of any Bond shall be deemed to be and may be treated as its absolute owner for all purposes whether or not

<<<

<<<

 form and containing the same representations and certifications (if any), unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer), duly completed and executed and any other evidence as the Registrar or Transfer Agent may reasonably require. In the case of a

<<<

 transfer of part only of a holding of Bonds represented by one Certificate, a new Certificate shall be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a further new Certificate in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred

<<<

 shall be issued to the transferor. In the case of a transfer of Bonds to a person who is already a holder of Bonds, a new Certificate representing the enlarged holding shall only be issued against surrender of the

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 20-


<<<


70-40601070

<<<

 may be changed by the Issuer, with the prior written approval of the Registrar and the Trustee. A copy of the current regulations will be made available by the Registrar to any Bondholder upon request.

(b) Exercise of Options or Partial Redemption

<<<

 in Respect of Bonds

In the case of an exercise of an Issuer's or Bondholders' option in respect of, or a partial redemption of, a holding of Bonds represented by a single Certificate, a new Certificate shall be issued to the holder to reflect

<<<

 the exercise of such option or in respect of the balance of the holding not redeemed. In the case of a partial exercise of an option resulting in Bonds of the same holding having different terms, separate Certificates shall be issued in respect

<<<

 of those Bonds of that holding that have the same terms. New Certificates shall only be issued against surrender of the existing Certificates to the Registrar or any Transfer Agent.

(c) Delivery of New Certificates

<<<

<<<

 new Certificate to such address as may be so specified, unless such holder requests otherwise and pays in advance to the relevant Transfer Agent or the Registrar (as the case may be) the costs of such other method of delivery and/ or such insurance

<<<

 as it may specify. In this Condition 2(c), "business day" means a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks are open for business in the place of the specified office of the relevant Transfer Agent or the Registrar (as the case may

<<<

 be).

(d) Transfer or Exercise Free of Charge

Certificates, on transfer, exercise of an option or partial redemption, shall be issued and registered without charge by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Registrar or any Transfer Agent, but upon

<<<

 payment by the Bondholder of any tax or other governmental charges that may be imposed in relation to it (or the giving of such indemnity as the Registrar or the relevant Transfer Agent may require).

(e) Closed Periods

No Bondholder may require

<<<

 the transfer of a Bond to be registered (i) during the period of 15 days ending on (and including) the due date for redemption of that Bond, (ii) during the period of 15 days prior to (and including) any date on which Bonds may be called for

<<<

 redemption by the Issuer at its option pursuant to Condition 6(c), (iii) after any such Bond has been called for redemption, or (iv) during the period of seven days ending on (and including) any Record Date.

3.

<<<

 unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among themselves. The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Bonds shall, save for such exceptions as may be provided

<<<

 by applicable legislation, at all times rank at least pari passu with all its other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE BONDS WHILE IN GLOBAL FORM

1.

Initial Issue of Certificates

The

<<<

 Global Certificate will be registered in the name of a nominee (the "Registered Holder") for a common safekeeper for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (the "Common Safekeeper") and may be delivered on or prior to the original issue date

<<<

 of the Bonds. Depositing the Global Certificate with the Common Safekeeper does not necessarily mean that the Bonds will be recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and intra-day credit operations by the Eurosystem either

<<<

 upon issue, or at any or all times during their life. Such recognition will depend upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility criteria.

Upon the registration of the Global Certificate in the name of any nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

, Luxembourg and delivery of the Global Certificate to the Common Safekeeper, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg will credit each subscriber with a nominal amount of Bonds equal to the nominal amount thereof for which it has subscribed and

<<<

2.

Relationship of Accountholders with Clearing Systems

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other clearing system ("Alternative Clearing System") as the holder of a Bond represented

<<<

 by a Global Certificate must look solely to Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any such Alternative Clearing System (as the case may be) for his share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of the Global Certificate and in relation

<<<

 to all other rights arising under the Global Certificate, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg, or such Alternative Clearing System (as the case may be). Such persons shall

<<<

 have no claim directly against the Issuer in respect of payments due on the Bonds for so long as the Bonds are represented by the Global Certificate and such obligations of the Issuer will be discharged by payment to the holder of the Global

<<<

 Certificate in respect of each amount so paid.

3.

Exchange

The following will apply in respect of transfers of Bonds held in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or an Alternative Clearing System. These provisions will not prevent the trading

<<<

 of interests in the Bonds within a clearing system whilst they are held on behalf of such clearing system, but will limit the circumstances in which the Bonds may be withdrawn from the relevant clearing system.

Transfers of the holding of

<<<

 Bonds represented by the Global Certificate pursuant to Condition 2(a) may only be made in part:

(i)

if the relevant clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days

(other than by reason of holidays, statutory or

<<<

 otherwise) or announces an intention

permanently to cease business or does in fact do so; or

(ii)

upon or following any failure to pay principal in respect of any Bonds when it is due

and payable; or

(iii) with the consent of the Issuer

<<<

,

provided that, in the case of the first transfer of part of a holding pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the Registered Holder has given the Registrar not less than 30 days' notice at its specified office of the Registered Holder's

<<<

 intention to effect such transfer.

<<<

 conditions of the Bonds set out in this Prospectus. The following is a summary of certain of those provisions:

4.1 Payments

All payments in respect of Bonds represented by a Global Certificate will be made to, or to the order of, the person

<<<

 whose name is entered on the Register at the close of business on the record date which shall be on the Clearing System Business Day immediately prior to the date for payment, where "Clearing System Business Day" means Monday to Friday inclusive

<<<

 except 25 December and 1 January.

4.2 Meetings

For the purposes of any meeting of Bondholders, the holder of the Bonds represented by the Global Certificate shall (unless the Global Certificate represents only one Bond) be treated as two

<<<

 persons for the purposes of any quorum requirements of a meeting of Bondholders and as being entitled to one vote in respect of each integral currency unit of the currency of the Bonds.

4.3 Trustee's Powers

In considering the interests of

<<<

 Bondholders while the Global Certificate is held on behalf of, or registered in the name of any nominee for, a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by such clearing system or its operator as to the

<<<

 identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements to the Global Certificate and may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of the Bonds represented by the Global Certificate.


<<<


4.4 Notices

So long as any Bonds are represented by a Global Certificate and such Global Certificate is held on behalf of a clearing system, notices to the holders of Bonds may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that clearing system

<<<

 for communication by it to the relative accountholders. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the holders of the Bonds on the second business day after such notice is delivered to that clearing system.

5 Electronic Consent

<<<

 and Written Resolution

(a) approval of a resolution proposed by the Issuer or the Trustee (as the case may be) given by way of electronic consents

<<<

(b) where Electronic Consent is not being

<<<

 sought, for the purpose of determining whether a Written Resolution (as defined in the Trust Deed) has been validly passed, the Issuer and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on consent or instructions given in writing directly to the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Trustee, as the case may be, by accountholders in the clearing system with entitlements to such Global Certificate or, where the accountholders hold any such entitlement on behalf of another person, on written consent from or written

<<<

 instruction by the person identified by that accountholder as the person for whom such entitlement is held. For the purpose of establishing the entitlement to give any such consent or instruction, the Issuer and the Trustee shall be entitled

<<<

 to rely on any

Business strategy and operations

The Group operates in the real estate sector and its operations comprise of investing in, developing

<<<

 and managing residential properties across a number of cities in Europe and North America. The Group acquired its first residential properties in Gothenburg, Helsingborg and Trollhättan in the Kingdom of Sweden in 1994. In subsequent years

<<<

, the Group expanded through reinvestments of profits in existing and new real estate properties in the Kingdom of Sweden. In 2003, the Issuer acquired Mandamus Fastigheter AB, a Swedish listed real estate company and increased its property

<<<

 portfolio to SEK 15,000 million. In 2006, the Group entered the German market acquiring 402 residential units in Berlin followed by properties in Hamburg and other German cities. An affiliated company of the Group first acquired properties

<<<

 in Toronto in 2011. This affiliated company was acquired by the Group in December 2013. An affiliated company of the Group first acquired residential properties in London in 2011 and these properties were acquired by a subsidiary of the Issuer

<<<

 in 2014. The Group entered into the US market

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 39-

70-40601070

through its acquisitions of property in New York in 2015. In 2014, the Group acquired its first properties in Paris.
The Group's business strategy is based

<<<

 on the long-term ownership and management of residential properties that generate a steadily growing cash flow. In this respect, the Group particularly focuses on the total return from the properties over ten years rather than the initial short

<<<

-term yield. The Group's business strategy is centred around properties located in cities that evidence growing income and population and stable rent growth, and within those cities, the Group targets properties that are in districts and suburbs

<<<

 that are either well established residential areas or that are undergoing regeneration or development. In this respect, the average population growth over the previous ten years in the metropolitan areas where a large proportion of the Group

<<<

's portfolio is located (namely, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, London, Paris, Toronto, Montreal and New York) was approximately 12 per cent.1By comparison, the average population growth over the previous 10 years in

<<<

 the countries where those cities are based (namely, Kingdom of Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Canada and the USA) was approximately 6 per cent.2The Group also seeks to invest in properties that can benefit from and generate greater

<<<

 returns as a result of an upgrade of such properties by the Group to a "first class" standard (as discussed below in "Development projects"). The Group believes that the combination of properties in established locations in metropolitan areas

<<<

 with growing populations minimises the property vacancy risk and provides strong growth in rent and operating surplus. The Group regularly reinvests its profits and applies its profits to the upgrading of the Group's current properties to a

<<<

 "first class" standard and to the acquisition of new properties (as discussed below in "Acquisition process").
As at 30 June 2015, the Group had 510 employees and a property portfolio of 50,169 residential units with an aggregate assessed value

<<<

 of SEK 64,840 million. The Kingdom of Sweden is the Group's largest market and, as at 30 June 2015, accounted for approximately 47 per cent. of its property portfolio, while Germany accounted for approximately 35 per cent., the United Kingdom

<<<

 accounted for 7 per cent., Canada accounted for 6 per cent. and the United States and France together accounted for 4 per cent.

In general terms, the Group's profit is

<<<

 largely generated from rental income and from the increase in value of its property portfolio. The Group's consolidated rental income for the year 2014 was SEK 3,602 million, which represents an increase of SEK 577 million as compared to the

<<<

 year 2013. The rental income for comparable properties for the year 2014, adjusted for changes in exchange rates, increased by 3.4 per cent. as compared to the year 2013. In the first half of 2015, the Group's consolidated rental income was

<<<

 SEK 2,095 million, which represents an increase of SEK 388 million as compared to the first half of 2014. The rental income for comparable properties for the first half of 2015, adjusted for changes

in exchange rates, increased by 4.5 per cent. compared to the same period in 2014. The Group's net profit before tax for the year 2014 was SEK 852

<<<

 million, which was down on the figure from 2013 (SEK 2,897 million) principally as a result of the decrease in the fair value of the Group's derivative financial instruments. In the first half of 2015, the Group's net profit before tax was

<<<

 SEK 2,640 million, which was an increase of SEK 1,993 million as compared to the same period in 2014. This increase was principally a result of an increase in the valuation of the Group's investment properties due to a rise in rental income

<<<

 and an increase in the value of the Group's interest rate derivatives.
Acquisition process
The Group selectively acquires residential properties through numerous smaller transactions (so called "cherry-picking") rather than making fewer purchases

<<<

 of large portfolios of properties. Acquisitions of properties follow a strict procedure based on established criteria and appropriate commercial, financial, tax, legal and technical diligence. In the acquisition process, the Group aims to exploit

<<<

 its market knowledge and years of experience in the real estate sector and, as a result, acquisitions are predominantly made in city districts or blocks where the Group already owns or has previously owned properties. This assists the Group

<<<

 in making assessments as to the rent, vacancy, price and return levels of the properties. Acquisitions are completed locally by the regional office in the city or area where the property is located. Following an acquisition, each regional office

<<<

 must follow up on the assumptions made during the purchase and it is responsible for any deviations between the initial assumptions and the actual performance. Any necessary financing is also secured prior to the acquisitions being made.
In

<<<

 2014, the Group acquired properties for a total price SEK 9.7 billion, (including SEK 2.1 billion of intra-Group acquisitions) and this represented an increase of 40.2 per cent. as compared to 2013. In 2014, properties for SEK 3,384 million

<<<

 were acquired in Germany, SEK 2,953 million in the United Kingdom, SEK 2,078 million in the Kingdom of Sweden, SEK 1,092 million in Canada and SEK 172 million in France. The main acquisitions in 2014 were in relation to properties in Malmö

<<<

, the Kingdom of Sweden for SEK 2.1 billion and Berlin, Germany for SEK 2.9 billion.
During the first half of 2015, the Group acquired properties for a total price of SEK 5.9 billion and this represented an increase of 29 per cent. as compared

<<<

 to the first half of 2014. Properties for SEK 2,182 million were acquired in the USA, SEK 1,324 million were acquired in Germany, SEK 647 million in the United Kingdom, SEK 929 million in the Kingdom of Sweden, SEK 411 million in Canada and

<<<

 SEK 402 million in France. The main acquisitions during the first half of 2015 were in relation to properties in New York for SEK 2,182 million, Stockholm for SEK 883 million, London for SEK 647 million, Paris for SEK 402 million, Toronto for

<<<

 SEK 357 million and Berlin for SEK 1,124 million. Between 30 June 2015 and 28 August 2015, the Group has acquired properties for a total price of SEK 2.6 billion, including 378 apartments in New York which were acquired for SEK 1.0 billion

<<<

. Sales during the same period amounted to SEK 0.8 billion and consisted mainly of commercial properties in Sweden.
Description of the Group's property portfolio
In 2009, the Group's property portfolio was spread across 46 cities. Since then

<<<

, the Group has disposed of its property holdings in 14 cities and has acquired properties in five new cities (London, Toronto, Montreal, Paris and New York), leaving the Group with a property portfolio spread across 37 cities as at the date

<<<

 of this Prospectus. This shift in focus is a reflection of the Group's strategy to target established metropolitan cities that evidence growing income and population.

 regional cities and larger German cities. In March 2015, the Issuer acquired its first US-based properties in New York. As at 30 June 2015, the Group's property portfolio offers 3,223,000 square metres of residential lettable space and 383

<<<

,000 square metres of commercial lettable space. The commercial lettable space predominantly forms part of the ground floor of primarily residential properties.
The estimated fair value of the Group's property portfolio as at 30 June 2015 was

<<<

 SEK 64,840 million, which represented an increase of SEK 7,104 million as compared to 31 December 2014. During the first half of 2015, the property portfolio had an increase in property value of SEK 1,925 million, mainly as a result of increased

<<<

 rental income and a lower required yield. From 1 January to 30 June 2015 the value of the Group's property investments was SEK 825 million, the value of net acquisitions was SEK 4,902 million and the effect due to changes in currency levels

<<<

 amounted to SEK -548 million.
The estimated fair value of the Group's property portfolio as at 31 December 2014 was SEK 57,736 million, which represented an increase of SEK 13,632 million as compared to 31 December 2013. During 2014, the property

<<<

 portfolio had an increase in property value of SEK 1,412 million, mainly due to increased rental income. In 2014, the value of the Group's property investments was SEK 1,881 million, the value of net acquisitions was SEK 8,594 million and the

<<<

 effect due to changes in currency levels amounted to SEK 1,745 million.
The fair value of the properties is determined by internal valuations by the Group. The properties are valued using the yield method, which means that each property is

<<<

 valued by discounting its estimated future cash flows. The estimated future cash flows are based on existing rental income and estimated operating and maintenance costs adjusted for expected changes in rental and vacancy levels. The property

<<<

's fair value comprises the sum of the discounted cash flows during the calculation period and the residual value. The valuation is made under IFRS 13, level 3 - see Note 3 "Risk Management - Value Levels" of the 2014 Financial Statements for

<<<

 further information. In order to verify the internal valuation, the Group engages local branches of CBRE Group, Inc. ("CBRE") to estimate at least one third of the portfolio each year. In 2014, CBRE reviewed 280 properties out of 880 properties

<<<

 owned by the Group which corresponded to 32 per cent. of the number of properties and 60 per cent. of the fair value. CBRE's estimate was SEK 103 million, or 0.30 per cent., higher than the Group's internal valuation.
The Group reviews and

<<<

 analyses the existing property portfolio with the aim of identifying assets which require upgrading, refurbishment or extension, or to dispose of the properties which do not continue to meet the Group's business objectives.
As at 30 June 2

<<<

015, the total vacancy rate for residential properties of the Group was 3.7 per cent. (as compared to 3.2 per cent. as at 31 December 2014 and 2.6 per cent. as at 31 December 2013), of which 66 per cent. was the result of upgrades and intended

<<<

 sales of residential units. As at 30 June 2015, the real vacancy rate increased to 1.3 per cent. as compared to 1.0 per cent. as at 31 December 2014. The difference between the real vacancy rate and the vacancy rate is that the real vacancy

<<<

 rate does not include residential units that are left vacant as a result of upgrades or sales.
During the first half of 2015, the Group sold properties for a total price of SEK 1.0 billion and the sales price was 5 per cent. above the fair

 value of the properties as measured at the beginning of the year. In 2014, the Group sold properties for a total price of SEK 1.1 billion and the sales price was 14 per cent. above the fair value of the properties as measured at the beginning

 of the year. In 2013, the Group sold properties for a total price of SEK 1.8 billion and the sales price was 10 per cent. above the fair value of the properties as measured at the beginning of the year. For the period 2011 to 2014, the Group

Rental regulations

<<<


The ability of the Group to increase the rent payable by tenants of its properties is regulated differently in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In some countries (such as the United Kingdom), the Group is, in the majority of cases

<<<

, able to increase rent freely in accordance with market practice, whereas in others (such as the Kingdom of Sweden) the ability to increase rent is subject to restrictions. In the regulated markets, the rent level normally fluctuates less and

<<<

 the rental income is more predictable. A brief description of the rental regulations in each country in which the Group operates is set out below.
Kingdom o f Sweden
Rents in the Kingdom of Sweden are negotiated between the landlord and the

<<<

 Swedish Union of Tenants in accordance with the system of "utility value" (Sw. Bruksvärdessystemet). This system implies that rent levels should be proportionate to the quality and standard of the property in question and can only be increased

<<<

 to a level that is in line with the rent that is charged on other comparable residential units (in other words, rents can normally only be subject to more significant above-inflation increases when the residential units have been upgraded)

<<<

. This rental regulation has resulted in low rent levels in the Kingdom of Sweden, which in turn leads to fewer new rental residential units and a housing shortage in growing cities such as Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. In the Kingdom of

<<<

 Sweden, rental regulation has also resulted in lower risks for property owners in relation to vacancy rates and rental income.
Germany
In Germany, the parties to a new rental agreement are in general freely able to agree on the rent. However

<<<

, in cities with a shortage of housing (Ge: angespannte Wohnungsmärkte), the rent may be restricted to the locally prevailing market rents (Ge: ortsubliche Vergleichsmiete) plus 10 per cent. This restriction does not apply to upgraded residential

<<<

 units (Ge: umfassende Modernisierung). Increases in the rent of current tenants are made via a comparison to the locally prevailing rents set forth in rent indices ("rent mirror" or Mietspiegel). The rent mirror is calculated by local authorities

<<<

 to reflect the standard and location of the properties. Increases in rent by comparison to the rent mirror are capped at 15 per cent. for

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 47-

70-40601070

every three-year period. Following any upgrades to the residential

<<<

 units, landlords are allowed to increase the rent of an existing tenant by a total of 11 per cent. of the modernisation cost incurred.
Canada
In Toronto, the parties to a new rental agreement are freely able to agree on the rent but increases

<<<

 for current tenants are controlled by the local authorities. The rent increase normally follows the level of inflation. As a result of upgrading to residential units, landlords are allowed to increase the rent of an existing rent contract by

<<<

 up to 9 per cent. over a period of three years.
In Montreal, the parties to a new rental agreement are freely able to agree on the rent but the new tenants are entitled to a court assessment of the rent. Landlords are allowed to increase the

<<<

 rent of an existing tenant when the landlord's costs increase and costs incurred for upgrades can to some extent be passed on to the tenants.
United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, rental regulations are in place only for tenancies that were

<<<

 granted prior to 1988. Such tenancies comprise three per cent. of the Group's portfolio as at 30 June 2015. The most common residential lease contract in England is an assured shorthold tenancy with an average duration of 12 months. Parties

<<<

 to such contract are freely able to renew the contract at market rent after expiry. Because of the high fluctuation and short duration of the lease contracts, the rent levels are usually close to market rents. By upgrading the residential units

<<<

 and the common areas, landlords are able to increase rents above the market rent.
France
In France, new leases can be set with a free rent level only if one of the following conditions is fulfilled: (i) first letting of the residential unit

<<<

, (ii) the residential unit has been vacant for the past eighteen months, (iii) the residential unit has been renovated within the last six months with a total cost of works that exceeds the previous annual rent. Current leases can be renegotiated

<<<

 after six years of tenancy only if the rent level is significantly below the market rent. In that case, the landlord can increase the rent based on the two of the following methods: (i) fifty per cent. of the difference between the locally

<<<

 prevailing rents observed in the neighbourhood (Fr: Loyer de reference) and the current rent at the renewal date, or (ii) fifteen per cent. of the improvement works (including value added tax) performed in the common or private areas during

<<<

 the lease period and if the total costs of those works exceed the previous annual rent. During the first six years of tenancy following the acquisition date for existing contracts, the annual rental increase cannot exceed the variation of the

<<<

 IRL cost of living index (Fr: L'Indice de Reference de Loyers).
USA
In the USA, the rental regulations vary significantly from city to city. In New York, rent systems comprise three types. Controlled rent exists when the landlord is generally

<<<

 not entitled to any significant increase of the rent level for existing tenants but can increase the rent when there is a change of tenant and the new tenant is not a lawful successor. The landlord can apply to a current tenant for an increased

<<<

 rent, but the tenant has the opportunity to challenge this request. Stabilised rent exists when the landlord can increase the rent annually according to a guideline which is approximately in line with the consumer price index. When there is

<<<

 a change in the tenant, the rent can be increased by at least 18.25 per cent. and the rent can further be increased by an additional sum not exceeding 20 per cent. of any improvement costs incurred. Free market rent exists when the rent is

<<<

 fixed according to the contract and upon renewal, the lease can be set freely at market rent.
Property management
The Group's property management teams at a local level are dedicated to the management of properties in a given country. The Group

<<<

's property management is organised into six units, one for each country in which the Group owns properties. The Group manages each of the six units separately and dedicates a country manager to each unit. Each country manager is responsible

<<<

 for managing tenants, lettings, services, upgrades, projects, purchases and sales, property valuations, and monitoring compliance with regulatory and accounting requirements, including tax and value added tax returns. The country managers provide

<<<

 insight into the local requirements and market dynamics and aim to ensure profitability in their

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 48-

70-40601070

respective countries. The Group has dedicated administration teams responsible for the Group's overall

<<<

 activities which supports the units in their local operations.

Development projects
The Group also seeks to enhance the value of its properties by carrying out projects that are designed to develop and upgrade its residential units and real

<<<

 estate properties. The Group's overarching project in this respect is the upgrading of its properties (in particular the apartments, stairwells, entrances and gardens within those properties) to a "first class" standard, in accordance with

<<<

 the Group's "Better Living" concept. The "Better Living" concept is oriented towards upgrading the Group's vacant rental residential units to the standard of newly-built condominiums. The costs associated with these upgrades are, to a certain

<<<

 extent, recovered through increases to the rent payable for such properties. By upgrading only its vacant residential units, the Group ensures that its current tenants are not obliged to accept a higher standard and, respectively, higher rents

<<<

. In 2011-2014, the Group upgraded 14,000 residential units for a total investment of SEK 3.5 billion. In 2014, the Group upgraded 4,000 residential units for a total investment of SEK 1 billion and upgraded the communal areas of some of its

<<<

 properties for a total investment of SEK 0.8 billion. The Group also invests significantly in development projects that seek to maximise the energy efficiency of its properties and in projects that convert commercial premises into residential

<<<

 units.
The Group commits to centralised and standardised purchasing of construction materials (so called "StreamLine Production"). This ensures consistency in terms of quality and provides opportunities for volume discounts. In 2014, the Group

<<<

 introduced a fully-developed support system which manages the logistics and the administration of its development projects. This system simplifies, among other things, the logistics and cost control processes associated with the projects. The

<<<

 Group continuously focuses on effective internal coordination in order to reduce both the time and the cost of its development projects.

The current financial policy of the Group was published by the Group's management in June 2015. Pursuant to this policy, the Group is aiming to achieve the

<<<

 following targets by the end of 2016: (a) a loan-to-value ratio of 50 per cent.; (b) an interest cover ratio that exceeds 1.8; (c) a liquidity reserve that amounts to SEK 3,000 million.

The Group's investments, operations and development projects

<<<

 are financed by a variety of sources. In terms of equity contributions, during 2014, the Group increased its consolidated equity, which amounted to SEK 22,583 million as at 31 December 2014 (as compared to SEK 15,169 million as at 31 December

<<<

 2013). The Group's equity to assets ratio was 38 per cent. as at 31 December 2014, as compared to 33 per cent. as at 31 December 2013. As at 30 June 2015, the Group's consolidated equity amounted to SEK 26,087 million, with the equity to assets

<<<

 ratio increasing to 40 per cent. In 2014, Akelius GmbH (a subsidiary of the Issuer) issued a hybrid bond in an aggregate principal amount of EUR 150 million, which was fully subscribed for by the Issuer's main shareholder, Akelius Apartments

<<<

 Ltd. This hybrid bond is classified as equity in the Group's consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the Issuer raised SEK 2,000 million (gross proceeds) through the issue of 6 million new preference shares. The total

181772-4-4

<<<

-v22.0

- 49-

70-40601070

voting power in the Issuer for the owners of preference shares increased from 0.04 per cent. to 0.07 per cent. of the total votes as a result.
The Group has developed relationships with a number of credit institutions

<<<

 in the respective markets in which it operates. As at 30 June 2015, the Group had entered into financing arrangements with 34 banks across the Kingdom of Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom , Canada and the USA. The Group uses its long-term

<<<

 debt to reduce refinancing and interest rate risk. The Issuer does not usually distribute dividends to its ordinary shareholders and regularly reinvests the Group's profits, thus effectively increasing the size of the Group's property portfolio

<<<

 without increasing the loan-to-value ratio. There are no mandatory rules on the Issuer distributing dividends to its preference shareholders and the Issuer does not maintain a prescriptive strategy in this respect. During the first half of

<<<

 2015, the Issuer distributed dividends on its preference shares in an aggregate amount of SEK 158 million. The Group's secured loans amounted to SEK 29,082 million as at 30 June 2015, an increase of SEK 1,416 million as compared to 31 December

<<<

 2014. During the first half of 2015, the Group's total borrowings increased by SEK 3,185 million to a total of SEK 33,521 million. During the same period, the Group's total loan-to-value ratio decreased from 52 per cent. to 51 per cent. This

<<<

 follows on from decreases of the loan-to-value ratio from 56 per cent. to 52 per cent. during 2014, which is a reflection of the Group's strategy to maintain a strong financial position.
The Group's secured loan-to-value ratio was 44 per cent

<<<

. as at 30 June 2015, as compared to 47 per cent. as at 31 December 2014. This is in line with the Group's ambition to lower the overall share of its secured lending. The Group's total loans were on average tied up for 5.0 years as at 30 June

<<<

 2015, as compared to 4.5 years as at 31 December 2014 and 4.6 years as at 31 December 2013. As at 30 June 2015, the total loans of the Group carried an average interest rate of 3.56 per cent. which represented a decrease as compared to 31 December

<<<

 2014 (3.94 per cent.) and 31 December 2013 (4.75 per cent.). The average interest rate hedge for total loans was 3.9 years as at 30 June 2015, as compared to 4.2 years as at 31 December 2014 and 5.0 as at 31 December 2013.
The Group's interest

<<<

 coverage ratio for total loans was 1.6 as at 30 June 2015, as compared to 1.5 as at 31 December 2014 and 1.2 as at 31 December 2013. These increases were principally as a result of decreases in the interest rates combined with increases in

<<<

 the Group's operating surplus. As at 30 June 2015, available funds in the form of cash and secured but unutilised credit facilities totalled SEK 3,130 million, as compared to SEK 1,765 million as at 31 December 2014 and SEK 1,597 million as

<<<

 at 31 December 2013. This increase was principally as a result of new issues of preference shares, senior unsecured bonds and an increase in bank credit facilities.
As at the date of this Prospectus, the Issuer has issued two unsecured bonds

<<<

 that remain outstanding, one of SEK 1,350 million (maturing in March 2018) and one of SEK 1,400 million (maturing in March 2019). The bonds are listed on the regulated market of the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm AB.
Credit rating
The long-term obligations

 of the Issuer are rated BBB- by Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services Europe Limited ("Standard & Poor's"). Standard & Poor's is established in the European Union and registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, as amended.

TAXATION
Prospective investors should consult their professional advisers on the tax consequences of buying, holding or selling any Bonds in light of their own

<<<

 particular circumstances, including the effect of the laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile. The discussion that follows for the Kingdom of Sweden is based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as of the

<<<

 date hereof, all of which laws and interpretations are subject to change or differing interpretations, which changes or differing interpretations could apply retroactively.
Certain Swedish Tax Considerations
The following summary of certain

<<<

 tax considerations that may arise as a result of holding listed9Bonds is based on current Swedish tax legislation and is intended only as general information for Bondholders who are resident in the Kingdom of Sweden for tax purposes, unless

<<<

 otherwise indicated. This description does not deal comprehensively with all tax consequences that may occur for Bondholders. For instance, it does not cover the specific rules where Bonds are held by a partnership, as current assets in a business

<<<

 operation, via a capital insurance (Sw: kapitalforsakring) or investment deposit account (Sw:investeringssparkonto) or held as hedge for foreign currency exposure. Special tax consequences that are not described below may also apply for certain

<<<

 categories of taxpayers, including investment companies, investment funds and insurance companies. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisers for information with respect to the special tax consequences that may

<<<

 arise as a result of holding Bonds, including the applicability and effect of foreign income tax rules, provisions in double taxation treaties and other rules which may be applicable.
Taxation o fIndividuals Resident in the Kingdom o fSweden

<<<


Capital Gains and Losses
Individuals who sell their Bonds are subject to capital gain taxation with a tax rate of 30 per cent. The capital gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the sales (or redemption) proceeds, after deduction

<<<

 of sales costs, and the Bonds' acquisition cost for tax purposes. The acquisition cost is determined according to the "average method". This means that the costs of acquiring all Bonds of the same type and class as the sold Bonds are added

<<<

 together and the average acquisition cost is calculated collectively, with respect to changes of the holding.
Gains or losses on currency exchange rate fluctuations may arise in relation to Bonds where the sales proceeds received are in a foreign

<<<

 currency. However, no special calculations are required if the sales proceeds are exchanged into SEK within 30 days from the time of disposal. In such case, the exchange rate on the date of exchange shall be used when calculating the value

<<<

 of the sales proceeds. The exchange rate on the date of acquisition is generally used when determining the acquisition cost for tax purposes.
Capital losses on listed Swedish receivables are fully deductible in the income category capital.

<<<

 According to Swedish case law, full deductibility also applies for capital losses on listed foreign receivables.
If a deductible deficit arises in the income category capital, a reduction of the tax on income from employment and from business

<<<

 operations, as well as tax on real estate and the municipal real estate fee, is allowed. The tax reduction is 30 per cent. of the deficit not exceeding SEK 100,000 and 21 per cent. of any part of the deficit in excess of SEK 100,000. Deficits

<<<

 may not be carried forward to a subsequent fiscal year.
Interest
Any interest income received by an individual holder during the time of holding the Bonds is subject to Swedish tax at a tax rate of 30 per cent. in the income from capital category

<<<

. Interest income is taxable when the income can be disposed of, in accordance with the "cash method".
For the Bonds to be considered as listed it is, according to the Swedish Tax Agency not sufficient that the Bonds are admitted to trading

<<<

 on a regulated market, the Bonds also have to be traded.

Preliminary Withheld Tax on Interest
If amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled

<<<

 in the Kingdom of Sweden, including a Swedish branch, to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) with residence in the Kingdom of Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld by the legal

<<<

 entity on such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes should normally be withheld also on other return on the Bonds (but not capital gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to above.
Taxation o f Swedish

<<<

 Legal Entities
Limited liability companies and other legal entities are normally taxed on its worldwide income (including income from the sale or redemption of the Bonds) with a corporate tax rate of 22 per cent.
Capital Gains and Losses
The

<<<

 calculation of capital gains and capital losses for legal entities is in general calculated as described under section "Taxation of Individuals Resident in the Kingdom of Sweden" above. Tax deductible capital losses on receivables incurred

<<<

 by limited liability companies and certain other legal entities are normally fully deductible against any taxable income.
Bonds in foreign currency should be valued at closing date rate at year end. A foreign exchange gain is taxable and a

<<<

 foreign exchange loss is tax deductible. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations that are treated as taxable/tax deductible may affect the acquisition cost of the Bonds.
Interest
Interest income is normally taxed on an accrual basis subject to corporate

<<<

 income tax.
Taxation o f Tax Residents Outside o f the Kingdom o fSweden
Capital Gains and Losses
Bondholders that are not tax residents in the Kingdom of Sweden and who are not conducting business from a permanent establishment in the Kingdom

<<<

 of Sweden are generally not liable for Swedish capital gain taxation on the disposal of Bonds. The Bondholders may be subject to tax in their country of tax residence.
Withholding Tax and Preliminary Withheld Tax on Interest
There is no withholding

<<<

 tax in the Kingdom of Sweden on interest payments nor will a preliminary tax be withheld on the interest payments or on the portion of the repayment of the Bonds that constitute interest.
EU Information Reporting and Withholding
The Savings

<<<

 Directive requires EU Member States to provide to the tax authorities of other EU Member States details of payments of interest and other similar income paid by a person established within its jurisdiction to (or secured by such a person for

<<<

 the benefit of) an individual resident, or to (or secured for) certain other types of entity established, in that other EU Member State, except that Austria will instead impose a withholding system for a transitional period (subject to a procedure

<<<

 whereby, on meeting certain conditions, the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that no tax be withheld) unless during such period it elects otherwise.
The Council of the European Union has adopted the Amending Savings

<<<

 Directive which would, when implemented, amend and broaden the scope of the requirements of the Savings Directive described above, including by expanding the range of payments covered by the Savings Directive, in particular to include additional

<<<

 types of income payable on securities, and by expanding the circumstances in which payments must be reported or paid subject to withholding. For example, payments made to (or secured for) (i) an entity or legal arrangement effectively managed

<<<

 in an EU Member State that is not subject to effective taxation, or (ii) a person, entity or legal arrangement established or effectively managed outside of the EU (and outside any third country or territory that has adopted similar measures

<<<

 to the Savings Directive) which indirectly benefit an individual resident in an EU Member State, may fall within the scope of the

181772-4-4-v22.0

- 56-

70-40601070

Savings Directive, as amended. The Amending Savings Directive requires

<<<

 EU Member States to adopt national legislation necessary to comply with it by 1 January 2016, which legislation must apply from 1 January 2017.
The Council of the European Union has also adopted a Directive (the "Amending Cooperation Directive

<<<

") amending Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation so as to introduce an extended automatic exchange of information regime in accordance with the Global Standard released by the OECD Council in July

<<<

 2014. The Amending Cooperation Directive requires EU Member States to adopt national legislation necessary to comply with it by 31 December 2015, which legislation must apply from 1 January 2016 (1 January 2017 in the case of Austria). The

<<<

 Amending Cooperation Directive is generally broader in scope than the Savings Directive, although it does not impose withholding taxes, and provides that to the extent there is overlap of scope, the Amending Cooperation Directive prevails.

<<<

 The European Commission has therefore published a proposal for a Council Directive repealing the Savings Directive from 1 January 2016 (1 January 2017 in the case of Austria) (in each case subject to transitional arrangements). The proposal

<<<

 also provides that, if it is adopted, Member States will not be required to implement the Amending Savings Directive. Information reporting and exchange will however still be required under Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended).
Investors

<<<

 who are in any doubt as to their position or would like to know more should consult their professional advisers.
The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax ("FTT")
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission

<<<

's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States").
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could

<<<

, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Bonds (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the

<<<

 participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Bonds where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may

<<<

 be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject

<<<

 to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
Joint statements issued by participating Member States indicate an intention to implement the FTT by 1 January 2016.
However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between

<<<

 the participating Member States, and the scope of any such tax is uncertain. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.
Prospective holders of the Bonds are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
