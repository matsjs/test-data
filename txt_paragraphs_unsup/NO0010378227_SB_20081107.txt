PROPOSED FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF W EGA MINING ASA -SUM M O

<<<

 NS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING.
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed Loan Trustee (the "Loan T rustee") for the above mentioned bond issue (the "Loan ") where Wega Mining ASA (the "B orrow er") is the Borrower. {All capitalised terms used in this

<<<

 document shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement for the above mentioned Bond Issue, or in this summons).
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' Meeting to consider a proposed financial restructuring

<<<

 of the Borrower.
The Wega Mining group's major activity is a gold mine project (the "Inata G old Project") in Burkina Faso in Africa. The project has experienced cost overruns and delays subsequently leading to a critical liquidity situation

<<<

 in the Borrower and an urgent need to raise further financing. The Borrower will attempt to raise the required capital through a private placement equity issue. In order to raise new equity the Borrower recognizes a need to first address its

<<<

 debt structure. The proposed financial restructuring includes converting the entire Loan to shares in the Borrower at a price of NOK 0.33 per share. The conversion will be conditional upon a minimum of MNOK 300 of new equity being successfully

<<<

 committed in a private placement, at an issue price of NOK 0.15 per share.
Attached to the summons is a statement from the Board of Directors of the Borrower describing the situation of the Borrower and the proposed restructuring plan.

The Borrower indirectly holds 90% of the shares in SMB which owns the Inata Gold Project in Burkina Faso, a low-cost, open-pit CIL gold mine currently under construction

<<<

. The remaining 10% are held by the state of Burkina Faso.
A review of the remaining work at the Inata Gold Project performed in October 2008 shows a project delay of 14 weeks with an expected first gold production in April 2009. The review

<<<

 also identified cost overruns of USD 38 million.
The Inata Gold Project is financed by MUSD 35 of equity, a MUSD 65 debt facility (the "M acquarie Facility") provided to SMB, and a cost overrun guaranty from Handelsbanken Oslo to Macquarie

<<<

 Bank (the "G uaranty") in the amount of MUSD 11.5 (non-recourse towards the Borrower, but with recourse towards the subsidiary Resolute West Africa Ltd). Currently SMB has drawn MUSD 55.8 on the Macquarie Facility. Flowever, further draw downs

<<<

 require that SMB raises further equity to cover the additional cost. The project company currently has MNOK 24.6 available, which is expected to be sufficient until 16 November 2008.
The Borrower (the parent company) currently has free cash

<<<

 and cash equivalents of approximately NOK 213,000. Not taking into account the additional capital required to the Inata Gold Project, these funds are expected to suffice until 16 November 2008.
Resulting from the cost overrun at the Inata Gold

<<<

 Project, the Borrower's board of directors has identified a capital requirement for the Borrower (including the Inata Gold Project) of MNOK 300. This amount includes a MNOK 25 "cushion", and is expected to suffice until a positive cash flow

<<<

 can be generated from the Inata Gold Project in April 2009.
THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING
The Borrower has engaged SEB Enskilda AS and Pareto Securities AS (the "Financial A d visors" ) as financial advisors and managers for the proposed

<<<

 financial restructuring.
The financial restructuring (the "Financial R estru cturing") is proposed to be carried out by a combination of
1. A private placement of MNOK 300 (the "Private Placem ent"); carried out by way of the placing of 2,

<<<

000,000,000 new shares in the Borrower, each such share with a par value of NOK 0.05 at a subscription price of NOK 0.15. The Private Placement will be conditional upon the 2/3 required majority in the extraordinary general meeting of the Borrower

<<<

. The Borrower's main shareholders have pre-approved the Private Placement. {The material provided to the investors in the Private Placement consisting o f the "Terms o f Application", the "Term Sheet" dated 30 October 2008 and the "Investor

<<<

 Presentation" dated 30 October 2008 is enclosed to this letter for information purposes).
2. A simultaneous conversion of the entire MNOK 400 Loan into equity of the Borrower. The conversion will be carried out by way of converting the Loan

<<<

 in exchange for 1,200,000,000 new shares in the Borrower, each such share with a par value of NOK 0.05. The subscription price per share will be NOK 0.333333 (rounded off). The conversion will be conditional upon that the Bondholders' meeting

<<<

 with the required 2/3 majority resolves to convert the Loan. Furthermore, the conversion of the Loan

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
will be conditional upon the 2/3 required majority in the extraordinary general meeting of the Borrower. The Borrower

<<<

's main shareholders have pre-approved the conversion of the Loan.
3. A possible subsequent repair issue (the "R epair Issu e") of up to MNOK 60 with a preferential right for existing shareholders in the Borrower which did not, and were not

<<<

 invited to, participate in the Private Placement. The Bondholders will not be invited to participate in the Repair Issue based on the shares resulting from the conversion. The Repair Issue is, in the Board's sole discretion only subject to

<<<

 the approval of the shareholders' meeting of the Borrower, intended to be carried out by way of issuance of up to 400,000,000 new shares in the Borrower, each such share with a par value of NOK 0.05. The subscription price per share in the

<<<

 Repair Issue will be equal to the Private Placement subscription price of NOK 0.15. The Private Placement and the conversion of the Loan will not be conditional upon the Repair Issue being completed.

Following the completion of the Financial

<<<

 Restructuring (excluding the Repair Issue), the share capital of the Borrower will be divided between (i) the Borrower's shareholders prior to the Financial Restructuring; (ii) the investors in the Private Placement; and (iii) the current Bondholders

 completion of the conversion of the Loan.

For a more detailed information of the Financial Restructuring the Bondholders of the Loan may contact Pareto Securities.

BONDHOLDERS M EETING
According to the Board of Directors of the Borrower a

<<<

 conversion of the Loan and a successful Private Placement will fully finance the Inata Gold Project to production (start-up expected in April 2009) given no unexpected events, the parent company (Wega Mining) will be debt free with a much healthier

<<<

 balance sheet, and the only interest bearing debt in the Group will consist of the Macquarie Facility.

· NORSK TILLITSM A N N ASA
According to the Board of Directors of the Borrower a stand-alone private placement was attempted with the assistance

<<<

 of the Financial Advisors based on the current capital structure and with the Loan intact. However it was not possible to attract sufficient interest from investors. Subsequently, using a higher subscription price in the conversion of the Loan

<<<

 compared to the subscription price in the Private Placement has been necessary in order to try to attract a sufficient amount of new capital to the Private Placement according to the Board of Directors of the Borrower. Another way of looking

<<<

 at this is that the Loan is valued at 45 % of its par value and then converted based on the same subscription price which is used in the Private Placement.
If SMB does not successfully raise equity to cover the additional capital requirements

<<<

 within medio November 2008, the Macquaire Facility could be defaulted and the security interests could be enforced by the bank. Macquarie Bank may also, in the event that SMB has no equity and/or is insolvent, elect to draw on the Guarantee

<<<

 to further develop the Inata Gold Project to increase the value of its collateral.
The likely alternative to a successful implementation of the Financial Restructuring is bankruptcy proceedings. Unencumbered assets in the Borrower include shares

<<<

 and a convertible bond with a principle value of USD 2,895,000 in Merit Mining Corp., shares in Koulekoun Exploration and Mining SA and shares in Metallica Mining AS. The assessment of the value of these assets is uncertain given today's market

<<<

 conditions.
The Loan Trustee regards a restructuring of the financial situation of the Borrower a necessity. The Borrower will without a restructuring in place possibly have to consider a bankruptcy petition which will represent an uncertain

<<<

 outcome for the Bondholders of the Loan. On the other hand the existing shareholders will after the Financial Restructuring (including the Repair Isssue) is completed in the opinion of the Loan Trustee be left with a larger proportion of the

<<<

 Borrowers share capital than what seems balanced given the bankruptcy position of the Borrower. The Financial Advisors and the Board of Directors of the Borrower is of the opinion that the proposal is based on what is necessary in order to

<<<

 make it possible to raise the needed equity in the Private Placement and get the approval from the extraordinary general meeting of the Borrower.
The proposed restructuring plan is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or

<<<

 recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed restructuring plan is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their tax advisors, legal advisors and financial

<<<

 advisors regarding the effect of the proposed restructuring plan.
Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' meeting:

 gold by 2009 and to be in full scale production by mid 2011 if economically sound.
1.2 The Inata Gold Project
1.2.1 Description o f the project and the project financing
Wega Mining's core project is the Inata Gold Project in Burkina Faso currently

<<<

 under construction. The Inata Gold Project entered the development phase in December 2007 based on a Bankable Feasibility Study issued by GBM Minerals Ltd ("GBM ") in October 2007.

2.2 Delay of production start-up and cost overrun
During June 2008, Wega Mining was advised by its engineering, procurement and construction management engineers (EPCM contractor GBM) o f the risk o f a certain delay and cost overrun to the

<<<

 start-up o f production at the Inata Gold Project. Additional professional expertise (Arccon Mining Services) was engaged during this period with the aim to expedite startup o f production and with the aim to obtain reliable information regarding

<<<

 both the expected timing and expected costs of the Inata Gold Project.
In October 2008, a full review of all remaining work (both EPCM and non-EPCM) at the Inata Gold Project concluded that the project will see delays of 14 weeks implying that

<<<

 the first gold production now is expected to take place in April 2009. Additional costs related to mechanical engineering, earthworks, project management and labor in the period are budgeted to a total of USD 38 million as follows:
· Increased

<<<

 construction time USD 27 million o Mechanical and structural engineering USD 17 million o Working capital requirements USD 10 million
· Consumables and shipping costs USD 4 million · Volume related costs USD 7 million
These additional costs

<<<

 take the capital expenditure budget for the Inata Gold Project to USD 138 million, including USD 5.4 million in contingency.
Macquarie Bank Ltd has been informed about the increase in the capital expenditure budget for the Inata Gold Project

<<<

. Macquarie Bank Ltd has confirmed that amounts already made available to SMB under the Macquarie Facility may be utilized for the project development. However, SMB will not be allowed to draw down the remaining USD 9.2 million under the Macquarie

2 THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING

2.1 Overview of

<<<

 the proposed financial restructuring

Wega Mining has engaged SEB Enskilda AS and Pareto Securities AS (the "Financial Advisors" or "M anagers") as financial advisors and managers for the proposed financial restructuring.

The financial restructuring

<<<

 (the "Financial Restructuring") is proposed to be carried out by a combination of (1) a private placement o f shares in Wega Mining with gross proceeds o f NOK 300 million in cash (the "Private Placement"); and (2) a simultaneous conversion

<<<

 (the "Debt Conversion") into equity o f the entire principal amount o f NOK 400 million under the "FRN Wega Mining ASA Callable Loan 2007/2012" (the "Bond Loan"); and (3) a possible subsequent repair issue (the "Repair Issue") o f up to NOK

<<<

 60 million. The three elements o f the Financial Restructuring are described in further detail in sections 2.2 - 2.4 below.

Following completion o f the Financial Restructuring (excluding the possible Repair Issue), the share capital o f Wega

<<<

 Mining will be divided between (i) Wega Mining's shareholders prior to the Financial Restructuring; (ii) the investors in the Private Placement; and (iii) the bondholders in the Bond Loan, as follows:

2.2 The Private Placement

The Private Placement will be carried out as an issue o f 2,000,000,000 new shares in Wega Mining, each share with a par value o f NOK 0.05. The subscription price per share

The Private Placement will be conditional upon (i) approval in an extraordinary general meeting of Wega Mining (the "EGM") with a 2/3 majority and (ii) approval in a bondholders meeting

<<<

 in the Bond Loan of the Debt Conversioa The EGM is scheduled to take place on or about 20 November 2008. Wega Mining's main shareholders have pre-approved the Private Placement and confirmed that they will vote in favor o f the Private Placement

 in the EGM.
The subscription material provided to investors in the Private Placement, consisting o f an "Investor Presentation" dated 30 October 2008, ``Terms o f Application", a "Term Sheet" dated 30 October 2008 and (together the "Private

<<<

 Placem ent Material") is enclosed to this letter for information purposes.
2.3 The Debt Conversion
The Debt Conversion will be carried out by way o f converting the bonds (the "Bonds") issued under the Bond Loan in exchange for 1,200,000,0

<<<

00 new shares in Wega Mining, each share with a par value o f NOK 0.05. Accrued unpaid interest will neither be converted into shares nor paid in cash, but shall be discharged. Upon completion o f the Debt Conversion, the Bonds will be exchanged

<<<

 for the new shares in Wega Mining by way o f using the Bonds as contribution in kind in the share issue. The subscription price per share in the Debt Conversion will be NOK 0.333333 (rounded) (the "Debt Conversion Subscription Price"). Conversion

<<<

 will be effected by a set-off of the total nominal value of the Bonds o f each bondholder to be converted against the issuing o f the whole number o f shares resulting from dividing the total nominal value o f the Bonds held by each bondholder

<<<

 by the Debt Conversion Subscription Price. Any excess amount beyond the whole number of shares converted by the Bonds hold by each bondholder shall by discharge.
Using a higher Debt Conversion Subscription Price compared to the Private Placement

<<<

 Subscription Price has been necessary to attract a sufficient amount of new capital to the Private Placement. Another way of looking at this is that the Bond Loan is valued at 45 % o f its par value and then converted based on the same subscription

<<<

 price which is used in the Private Placement.
The Debt Conversion will he conditional upon the bondholders' meeting in the Bond Loan approving a conversion o f the Bond Loan with the required 2/3 majority. Further, the Debt Conversion will

<<<

 be conditional upon the EGM approving to issue the new shares against contribution in kind consisting of the Bonds with a 2/3 majority. Wega Mining's main shareholders have pre-approved the Debt Conversion and confirmed that they will vote

<<<

 in favor o f the Debt Conversion in the EGM.
Simultaneous completion o f the Private Placement is a condition for completion of the Debt Conversion.
2.4 The Repair Issue
The Board o f Wega Mining will consider proposing to the EGM that a subsequent

<<<

 Repair Issue with an amount up to NOK 60 million through issuance o f up to 400,000,000 new shares, each share with a par value o f NOK 0.05, and where shareholders in Wega Mining as o f 5 November 2008 who were not offered or invited to participate

<<<

 in the Private Placement will be given preferential allocation. The subscription price per share in a Repair Issue (if carried out) will be equal to the Private Placement Subscription Price. There can, however, be no guarantees that such Repair

2.6 Other alternatives explored
A stand-alone private placement was attempted with the assistance o f the Financial Advisors based

<<<

 on the current capital structure and with the Bond Loan intact However it was not possible to attract sufficient interest from investors.
2.7 Consequences if the Financial Restructuring is not completed
If the proposed Financial Restructuring

<<<

 should fail to be completed, the Board o f Wega Mining considers that a bankruptcy of Wega Mining will be a likely outcome due to the critical liquidity situation in the Group. A bankruptcy scenario is believed to deteriorate values and any

<<<

 recovery prospects for the bondholders will be highly uncertain.
Should Wega Mining fail to raise the amount of new capital needed to fully finance the Inata Gold Project to production, there is a significant risk that Macquarie Bank will use

<<<

 its rights under the Macquarie Facility to accelerate the facility and demand immediate and full repayment of the outstanding balance of the Macquarie Facility and reversal o f the hedge facility. Should SMB fail to repay all amounts due under

<<<

 the Macquarie Facility, Macquarie Bank Ltd may also enforce of the collateral under the facility.
The value of the gold hedge at a spot gold price of USD 750/oz is approximately USD 38 million, which is approximately USD 18 million less than

<<<

 the outstanding balance of the Macquarie Facility. (The USD 38 potential financial gain on the hedge, may be exposed for 30% tax in Burkina Faso). In addition, Macquarie Bank may elect to continue the development of the Inata project, if SMB

<<<

 has no equity and/or is insolvent for up to the value o f the overrun guaranty at

USD 11,5 million, by paying vendors to the project, to try to increase the value o f its collateral. In the opinion o f the Board of Wega Mining, it would be very demanding to find a buyer willing to pay a purchase

<<<

 price sufficient to cover Macquarie Bank Ltd's claim of approximately USD 18 million as well as the remaining capital requirement for completing the Inata Gold Project to production (estimated to USD 54 million as o f October 30th less the

<<<

 potential utilisation o f the overrun guaranty). Accordingly, there is a risk that Macquarie Bank Ltd would enforce the collateral under the Macquarie Facility to seek to cover the remaining amount outstanding.
Unencumbered assets in Wega Mining

<<<

 ASA include shares and a convertible bond with principal value USD 2.895.000,00 in Merit Mining Corp1., shares in Koulekoun Exploration and Mining SA and shares in Metallica Mining A S. Merit Mining has a current market cap o f CAD 14.1 million

<<<

 (approximately NOK 80 million), o f which the Company has a 58.1% ownership interest (equal to NOK 46.7 million). Merit Mining Inc. has a short term cash requirement, and Wega Mining has accepted to be diluted down to 53.5% through a potential

<<<

 financing. A forced sale of this holding o f shares will at the opinion of the Board o f Wega Mining provide a lower recovery compared to where the share currently is trading. The remaining assets might also have some value, but any value is

<<<

 highly uncertain to quantify and assess. In addition approximately NOK 20 million will be required each year, in order for these assets to be maintained and kept in good stand.
On this basis, the Board o f Wega Mining considers the Financial

<<<

 Restructuring as the best alternative for preserving the values o f the bondholders.

Risk Factors
The risks discussed below are not the only ones that may affect the Company's business or the value of the Company

<<<

's securities. Additional risks, including risks not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently considers immaterial, may also impair the Company's business operations and prospects. If any such risks materialise, investors

<<<

 could lose the entire value of their investment.
GENERAL
Investing in the Company involves inherent risks. Prospective investors should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out herein before making an investment decision. The

<<<

 risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company's business operations and adversely affect the price

<<<

 of the Shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's business, financial position and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. A prospective investor should carefully consider the factors set forth

<<<

 below, and elsewhere, and should consult his or her own expert advisors as to the suitability of an investment in the Shares. An investment in the Shares is suitable only for investors who understand the risk factors associated with this type

<<<

 of investment and who can afford a loss of all or part of the investment. Such information is presented as of the date hereof and is subject to change, completion or amendment without notice.
All forward-looking statements included in this

<<<

 document are based on information available to the Manager on the date hereof, and the Manager assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements will, however, be updated if required by applicable

<<<

 law or regulation. Investors are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, and the actual results may differ materially from those included within the

<<<

 forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described below and elsewhere herein.
EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATING RISK
The

<<<

 Company's activities are primarily directed towards development and operation of its acquired projects. The Company is also actively engaged in searching for additional projects to acquire. The development and operation of mineral deposits

<<<

 involves significant risks which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. While the discovery of an ore body may result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are ultimately developed

<<<

 into producing mines. Major expenses may be required to locate and establish mineral reserves, to develop metallurgical processes and to construct mining and processing facilities at a particular site. It is impossible to ensure that the exploration

<<<

 or development programs planned by the Company will result in profitable commercial mining operations.
Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are: the particular attributes of the

<<<

 deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; commodity prices which are highly cyclical; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting

<<<

 of minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, and the combination of these factors could result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. There is no certainty

<<<

 that the expenditures made by the Company in its search for and evaluation of mineral deposits will result in discoveries of commercially viable quantities of ore.
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK AND HAZARDS
All phases of the Company's activities are subject

<<<

 to environmental regulation in the various jurisdictions where it operates. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation

<<<

, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which may result in stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental

<<<

 assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation will not adversely affect adversely

<<<

 the Company's activities. Government approvals and permits are required in connection with the Company's activities. To the extent approvals and permits are required and not obtained the Company may be curtailed or prohibited from proceeding

<<<

 with planned exploration or development of mineral properties. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities

<<<

, pursuant to which the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations or take corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. Parties, such as the Company, engaged in

<<<

 mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of their exploration and development activities and may be subjected to civil or criminal fines

<<<

 or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining and exploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could

<<<

 have a material adverse impact on the Company and cause increases in exploration expenses or require abandonment of or delays in the exploration and development of new mining properties.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
The exploration and development

<<<

 activities of the Company are subject to various laws governing exploration, development, mining, processing, taxes, labour standards and occupational health and safety, toxic substances, land use, water use, land claims of local people and

<<<

 other matters. Although the Company believes that its exploration and development activities are currently being carried out in accordance with all applicable laws, no assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted

<<<

 or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing exploration and development activities or more stringent implementation

<<<

 thereof could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company.
33

Risk Factors (Contd)
UNCERTAINTY IN THE ESTIMATION OF ORE/MINERAL RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES The figures for Ore/Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources contained herein

<<<

 are estimates only and no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved, that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that Ore/Mineral Reserves can be mined or processed profitably. There are numerous

<<<

 uncertainties inherent in estimating Ore/Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Such estimation is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any reserve or resource estimate is a function

<<<

 of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation. Short term operating factors relating to the Ore/Mineral Reserves, such as the need for orderly development

<<<

 of the Ore bodies or the processing of new or different Ore grades, may cause any Ore body to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period. In addition, there can be no assurance that recoveries derived from small scale laboratory tests

<<<

 will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. Fluctuation in commodity prices, results of drilling, metallurgical testing and production and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any

<<<

 estimate of Ore/Mineral Reserves or Mineral Resources may require revision of such estimates. The actual volume and grade of reserves mined and processed and recovery rates may not be the same as currently anticipated. Any material reductions

<<<

 in estimates of Ore/Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, or of the Company's ability to extract these Ore/Mineral Reserves, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The market price

<<<

 of the Company's Shares, financial results, exploration and development activities have previously been, and may in the future be, significantly adversely affected by declines in commodity prices, which are subject to significant fluctuation

<<<

. The factors giving rise to these fluctuations are generally out of the Company's control, being largely driven by external global economic factors. In particular the prices of gold has fluctuated significantly in recent years. Significant

<<<

 price declines in the future could render the Company's exploration, development and anticipated mining activities economically unfeasible until such time as the price recovers. These declines could result in a re-calculation of life-of-mine

<<<

 plans and reserve calculations which could have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial performance. RISK RELATING TO THE SHARES Securities of mining and exploration companies have experienced substantial price volatility in the

<<<

 past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include global macroeconomic developments and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. The Company

<<<

's share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short term changes in commodity prices or in its financial condition or results of operations as reflected in its quarterly financial statements. As a result of any of these factors

<<<

, the market price of the Company's Shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect the Company's long-term value. Securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the

<<<

 market price of their securities. The Company may in the future be the target of similar litigation which could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management's attention and resources. FINANCING RISKS The development of Wega

<<<

 Mining's properties will depend upon the Company's ability to obtain financing through equity financing, debt financing, project financing or other means. There is no assurance that Wega Mining will be successful in obtaining the required financing

<<<

. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictions on financing operating activities. If Wega Mining is unable to obtain additional financing as needed, it may

<<<

 be required to reduce the scope of its operations or anticipated expansion, or delay or indefinite postpone exploration, development or production on any or all of the Company's projects. LIQUIDITY RISK There is a risk that the Company may

<<<

 not be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due. This could have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company. LOAN COVENANTS Wega Mining has a project loan facility available with Macquarie Bank Ltd, Australia in

<<<

 the amount of USD 65 million (LIBOR +2.20%). The terms and conditions of the loan facility include inter alia restrictions on operations and covenants affecting the Company. There is a risk that the Company is not able to meet such restrictions

<<<

 and covenants, in which case the there could be a default on the loan. This would most likely have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company. HEDGING RISK As part of securing specific project financing, Wega Mining

<<<

 will have to enter into agreements with the creditor(s) to hedge certain levels of future production volumes. There is an implicit financial risk in the event that production volumes fail to meet the hedge agreements causing Wega Mining to

<<<

 remedy the situation by having to buy similar volumes in the open markets at prevailing market prices.
