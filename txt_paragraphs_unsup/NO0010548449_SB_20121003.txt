1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.1 Operational update
Since 2011, Noreco has gone through a financial, operational and organisational repositioning to strengthen the Company's long term financial

<<<

 outlook, reduce risk and position the Company for value generating growth. Over the course of this process, the Company has sold assets for approximately NOK 2 billion, reduced future investment commitments with a similar amount, and reduced

<<<

 debt through repayment of bank loans and bonds. At the same time, the Company has invested significant amounts in new field developments in order to increase its production. Noreco believes the renewal of its production base to new and high

<<<

 quality assets with lower operational costs and larger upside is beneficial to all stakeholders in the Company.
Page 1 of 14

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
The new Oselvar Field in Norway started production in April 2012, and the Huntington

<<<

 Field in the UK is expected to come on stream by the end of 2012. The combination of these two field developments is expected to increase Noreco's production to well above 10,000 boe/day (from approximately 4,700 boe/day in August 2012). The

<<<

 increased production will significantly improve the Company's cash flow. The Huntington Field will have a particularly significant impact on Noreco's financial position as the UK fiscal system allows for full amortization of historical expenses

<<<

 against taxable income from production. Consequently, the cash flow from the Huntington Field will not be subject to payable tax until GBP 89 million of historical costs from the investment phase have been recovered through earnings.
1.2 Financial

<<<

 update
The combination of the repositioning process and the timing of production start-up at the Huntington Field have created a temporary challenge for the Company with respect to the gearing ratio covenants contained in the Bond Agreements

<<<

. The sale of producing assets, while contributing to reduced financial risk for the Company, have also led to a temporaiy reduction of cash flow until production comes on stream from the new field developments. In addition, the Company's reserve

<<<

 based loan facility (the "RBL Facility"), while being an excellent financing tool for the Danish producing assets, does not provide sufficient financial flexibility on the Group level. The Company has therefore launched a refinancing program

<<<

 consisting of a NOK 400 million equity issue and a NOK 300 million bond (see further description below), to strengthen the balance sheet and provide sufficient liquidity to cover repayment of the remaining NOK 475,500,000 FRN Senior Secured

<<<

 Callable Bond Issue 2009/2012 (ISIN NO 001 054843.1, the "NOR03 Bond"), which matures on 20 November 2012.
1.3 Discussions with the Norwegian FSA on the 2011 annual financial statements
As further communicated on 28 September 2012, the Norwegian

<<<

 Financial Supervisory Authority (the "NFSA") has as part of its supervision o f listed companies initiated a review of Noreco's annual financial statements for 2011. The NFSA has raised certain specific issues with respect to the 2011 financial

<<<

 statements, issues which are currently subject to on-going discussions with the Company.
The NFSA has asked for information about several items, however, the key issues so far being discussed are related to the goodwill arising from the acquisition

<<<

 of Altinex in 2007 and the allocation of such goodwill to the assets disposed of by Noreco in 2011, as well as the booking of suspended wells. The amount of contested goodwill allocation is not clear, but could have an estimated impact on book

<<<

 equity in the range of NOK 30 to 200 million. The potential effect on the accounts of any reassessment of suspended wells is difficult to estimate at this stage. None of the issues being discussed with the NSFA will, however, have any cash

<<<

 effects.
The annual financial statements for 2011 were audited and an unqualified audit opinion was issued by the Company's independent auditor, and the NFSA's review has not uncovered any significant matters not previously considered by the

<<<

 Company and its auditor. Noreco is of the opinion that prudent and acceptable accounting standards in compliance with IFRS have been used, but as IFRS in several areas are judgemental, the discussion with the NFSA may nevertheless result in

<<<

 the Company reassessing the book value of its goodwill, licenses and capitalised exploration expenses going forward, and possibly making corresponding amendments to its comparative historical accounts. The issues being discussed have no cash

<<<


Page 2 of 14

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
effects, but the book equity covenant in each of the Bond Issues may be impacted by write downs of equity.
1.4 New equity and bond issues
As announced on 1 October 2012, Noreco has made a successful

<<<

 private placement of NOK 400 million of new equity (the "Equity Issue"), as part of the Company's plan to strengthen its balance sheet and enable the Company to deliver on its strategy to be a producer with high quality assets combined with

<<<

 high impact exploration.
Further, as announced on 2 October 2012, Noreco has made a successful placement of new senior unsecured bond of NOK 300 million (the "New Bond") to partly refinance the NOR03 Bond and in order to provide improved liquidity

<<<

 for the Company to implement the initiatives stated above. The term sheet for the New Bond is attached hereto.
1.5 Restructuring of the Group and other initiatives
In addition to completing the Equity Issue and the New Bond, Noreco has taken

<<<

 several initiatives that are expected to further strengthen the financial position of the Company:
· Production from the Huntington Field will increase the borrowing base of the existing RBL Facility.
· As announced on 28 September 2012, Noreco

<<<

 is planning to reorganise the legal structure o f the group, which will provide for more efficient operations.
Noreco is today both a holding company for a large number of entities in several jurisdictions and an operating company for a significant

<<<

 part of the group's activities in Norway. The current group structure is a result of several acquisitions and disposals, and has over time proved to be suboptimal. The Company is therefore preparing a reorganisation to achieve a more appropriate

<<<

 group structure.
The key objectives of this reorganisation are to transform Noreco into a pure holding company, with all operational activities being continued in wholly-owned subsidiaries, and thereafter seek to reduce the number of subsidiaries

<<<

 and over time targeting single operating entities for each jurisdiction. The first step in this respect will be the transfer of the remaining license participation rights currently held by Noreco itself on the Norwegian continental shelf to

<<<

 its 100% (indirectly) owned subsidiary Noreco Norway AS (formerly Altinex Oil Norway AS). This transfer (the "Transfer") will in addition to such licenses include all related assets, contracts and personnel, and will be effective as of 31 December

<<<

 2012. Subject to completion of the Transfer, Noreco Norway AS will become the owner of all the Group's licenses on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, and Norwegian Energy Company ASA will not own any licenses directly. The list of licenses being

<<<

 transferred is set out in Schedule 1. The book value of the licenses being transferred is NOK 114 million as of 2Q 2012.
Subsequently, the Noreco Group will do the same exercise for its UK and other assets.
The said corporate restructuring

<<<

 will provide for a more appropriate group structure, and be favourable both from risk management, financial, flow of funds and fiscal perspectives, and position Noreco for continued growth of its core business.
Page 3 of 14

NORSK TILLITSMANN

<<<


NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
The Noreco Group's activities, plans and strategy will remain unaffected by the reorganisation. The organisational structure will be unchanged, and the reorganisation will not have any negative consequences for the employees

<<<

.
This planned corporate restructuring will lead to the parent company, Norwegian Energy Company ASA, discontinuing its direct petroleum activities liable for special tax within the meaning of the Norwegian Petroleum Tax Act. As a consequence

<<<

, the restructuring will result in the unlocking of financial resources, by way of Noreco being entitled to claim payment from the Norwegian Government the tax value of its uncovered losses pursuant to the Norwegian Petroleum Tax Act section

<<<

 3(c)(4). As at 31 December 2011, this tax value amounted to NOK 569 million, and this amount will increase with the tax value of losses incurred in 2012. The tax refund is expected to become payable in cash to Noreco towards the end of 201

<<<

3, provided that the discontinuance of petroleum activity in the parent company will be completed by the end o f 2012. The right to such a refund has been confirmed by an advance tax ruling from the Norwegian Petroleum Taxation Board (iOljeskattenemnda

<<<

).
· Noreco is also actively pursuing an insurance claim relating to the damage to the Siri platform that occurred in 2009. The book value of the claim was NOK 354 million as per 30 June 2012. The total claim is significantly higher.
1.6 Further

<<<

 information
For further information on the above mentioned issues and other updates, please refer to the Company's stock exchange announcements of 28 September 2012 available on www.newsweb.no and relating to a trading update and contemplated

<<<

 refinancing.
1.7 Introduction to waiver and amendment proposal
On the back of the Equity Issue and the New Bond, Noreco wishes to put forward a request to the Bondholders (i) for a temporary waiver of certain gearing ratio covenants and (ii

<<<

) to make an amendment to the book equity covenant contained in each of the Bond Agreements. Completion of the Equity Issue is subject to the approval by the upcoming extraordinary general meeting of the Company, and issuance of the new equity

<<<

 is further contingent on a stable financial outlook for Noreco. The New Bond is also subject to the approval of the Equity Issue. As a consequence, Noreco proposes that the Bondholders waive the gearing covenants in each of the Bond Agreements

<<<

 for the period up to and including 4Q 2012 and that an allowance under the book equity covenant in each of the Bond Agreements is approved. As compensation for such waiver and allowance, Noreco offers a fee to the Bondholders upon approval

<<<

 in the Bondholders' Meetings to be held in each of the Bonds. Completion of the Equity Issue and the New Bond both remain subject to an approval of the waiver proposal and the proposed amendment to the book equity covenant, as further described

<<<

 in section 2 below.
Page 4 of 14

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

1.7.1 Gearing Ratio
A gearing ratio covenant exists in each of the Bond Agreements, calculated as "Net Interest Bearing Debt / Adjusted EBITDA ", The definition of Adjusted

<<<

 EBITDA in the NOR03 and NOR04 Bond Agreements differs slightly from the definition used in the NOR05 and NOR06/07 Bond Agreements with respect to how gains and losses from asset sales and write downs are to be treated. Therefore, the gearing

<<<

 ratio of the NOR03 Bond and the NOR04 Bond ("Gearing Ratio 1" / "GR1") differs slightly from that applicable to the NOR05 Bond and NOR06/07 Bond ("Gearing Ratio 2" / "GR2"). A breach of the gearing ratio covenants will only constitute an Event

<<<

 of Default under any of the Bond Agreements if the Company is in breach of the agreed covenant threshold for two consecutive financial quarters, and such breach is not remedied within the subsequent reporting date. The Bondholders in the NOR

<<<

03 Bond will not be required to give their consent to a waiver, as this Bond Issue falls due in November 2012 and will be repaid upon maturity.
As presented in the figure below, for 2Q 2012 the Gearing Ratio 1 was 4.lx and the Gearing Ratio

<<<

 2 was 6.lx, compared to the required covenant level of 5.Ox for both gearing ratios. The ratios have historically been in the 3.5x range (last four quarters on average). The graph below shows the development of Gearing Ratio 1 and Gearing Ratio

<<<

 2 over the recent financial quarters.

If the Equity Issue were not to be completed, Noreco expects to be in breach of both gearing ratio covenants until the Huntington Field has been in production for some time.

Provided that the

<<<

 Equity Issue is completed, and production at the Huntington Field commences as expected from the end of 2012, the Company is confident that it will be in compliance with both GR1 and GR2 from and including IQ 2013. The Equity Issue will also

<<<

 strengthen the Company's balance sheet and liquidity situation, enabling the Company to deliver on its strategy to become a producer with high quality assets combined with high impact exploration.

Page 5 of 14

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN

<<<

 TRUSTEE
A waiver up to and including 4Q 2012 will also provide the Company with sufficient headroom to allow for unforeseen operational delays that could affect the cash flow temporarily.
It is Noreco's view that the gearing covenant breaches

<<<

 are of a temporary nature, caused by the required strategic repositioning of the Company in combination with a timing gap until the results of the consolidation takes effect and the new production comes on-stream.

1.7.2 Book Equity Ratio In

<<<

 order to create a stable financial outlook, and in light of the Equity Issue and New Bond, Noreco will propose to obtain consent to an allowance from the Bondholders in the event that such write-downs as described in paragraph 1.3 above should

<<<

 occur. The Bond Agreements for all the Bonds contain a book equity ratio covenant of minimum 25.0% (the "Book Equity Ratio"), and the book equity ratio as of 2Q 2012 was 27.9%. The proposed allowance will entail adjusting for any potential

<<<

 write-downs related to goodwill and suspended wells limited upwards to NOK 600 million (after tax), which is then included in the calculation of the book equity ratio by adding the actual write-down amount to the calculation of equity and total

<<<

 assets. Noreco is confident that the proposed allowance in the ratio calculation, in addition to the Equity Issue, will be sufficient to stay within the covenant limit.

Together, the Equity Issue, the New Bond, the Huntington start-up, the anticipated

<<<

 tax refund, the temporary waiver of the gearing ratio covenants and the Book Equity Ratio allowance will create a stable long-term financial outlook for Noreco to the benefit of all the stakeholders of the Company. Therefore, Noreco asks the

 Bondholders to approve the Proposal as presented below.

Furthermore, implementation of the Proposal in each Bondholders' Meeting shall be subject to approval of the Proposal in each of

<<<

 the two other Bondholders' Meetings.
3 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
3.1 The Company's evaluation
The breach of the gearing ratio covenants is temporary, and it will be remedied through a combination of new equity and additional production coming

<<<

 on-stream, With Huntington on stream, the additional cash flow will bring the Company in compliance with the gearing ratio covenants within one quarter of full production. The New Equity will further strengthen the gearing ratio. The Company

<<<

 is thus using its best efforts to mitigate the breach, as well as the current liquidity situation.
The Huntington production marks the beginning of a new phase in the Company's history, resulting from the strategic repositioning of the Company

<<<

, with significant cash flow then being generated from a diversified production portfolio in Norway, Denmark and the UK. The increased cash flow will mitigate the current temporary gearing covenant breach and provide the Company with a comfortable

<<<

 position towards its gearing ratios covenants and debt obligations going forward.
Page 10 of 14

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
The potential write down of some of the Group's book value of its goodwill, licenses and capitalised exploration

<<<

 expenses will, if occurring, be limited to a non-cash effect.
In the Company's opinion, the Compensation Fee offered to the Bondholders as a compensation for the amendments is a fair and balanced proposal based on the temporary nature of the

<<<

 gearing ratio waiver and the non-cash nature of the Book Equity Ratio allowance as demonstrated above. The Bondholders should also consider the proposed addition of the debt restriction covenant described above.
The Company has engaged DNB

<<<

 Markets, Pareto Securities and SEB as the Company's financial advisors (the "Advisors") with respect to the Proposal. Accordingly, Bondholders may contact the Advisors as follow for further information:
DNB Markets, Fixed Income Sales at +

<<<

47 +47 22 01 77 46; or Pareto Securities AS, Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70; or SEB, Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 82 72 56.
The Advisors are acting solely for the Company and no-one else in connection with the Proposal. No due diligence

<<<

 investigations have been carried out by the Advisors with respect to the Company, and the Advisors expressly disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal ('including but not limited to the information contained

<<<

 herein').

3.2 Non-Reliance
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

 at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting for each of the NOR04 Bond, the NOR05 Bond and NOR06/07 Bond must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 of the voting Bonds must

<<<

 be represented at the meeting. If the Proposal is not approved by the Bondholders in each of the NOR04 Bond, the NOR05 Bond and the NOR06/07 Bond, the Bond Agreements will remain unchanged. For the avoidance of doubt, the two tranches in the

<<<

 NOR06/07 Bond shall vote in the same Bondholders' Meeting.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership

<<<

 of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal

<<<

 amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual Bondholder may authorise the Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly

<<<

 signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post to post@trustee,no , +47 22 87 94 10, or Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA, PO Box 1470 Vika, 0116 Oslo, Norway).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may

<<<

 be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
Yours sincerely Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
