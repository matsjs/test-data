 million to part finance the delivery of Gamma (the "Gamma Tranche") and iii) USD 177 million to part finance the delivery of Delta (the "Delta Tranche"). Expected interest rate is LIBOR plus a margin of approximately 3.25% p.a. However, the

<<<

 margin on the Gamma Tranche will be approx. 3.75% until a drilling contract which is acceptable to the Senior Lenders is entered into for the Gamma. The Senior Bank Facility will have a tenor of 5 years from first draw down (however will mature

<<<

 agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, pursuant to which the Trustee shall appoint the Agent as security agent to hold all Security on behalf of the Agent and the Trustee so that the Bond Issue and the Senior Bank Facility may be

<<<
