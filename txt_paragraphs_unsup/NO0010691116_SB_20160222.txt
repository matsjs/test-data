Background

Reference is made to the current recovery process in respect of the OSA Bonds after an Event of Default was declared under the OSA Senior Secured Bond Agreement on 28 February 20

<<<

14, including the sale of the vessel OSA Goliath (the "Vessel") to Goliath Offshore against partial write-down of debt in the OSA Borrower and simultaneous issuance of the Goliath Bonds.

As part of the recovery process, it is proposed that

<<<

 the Bondholders through the Bond Trustee pursue potential claims against third parties with an aim to maximize recovery. The proposed structure for this step in the recovery process, including funding of litigation costs, is further set out

<<<

 in item 2 (Litigation by the Bond Trustee andfunding via Litigation Funding SPV) below.

2.

Litigation by the Bond Trustee and funding via Litigation Funding SPV

2.1 Potential litigation by the Bond Trustee against third parties
It is proposed

<<<

 that the Bond Trustee (on behalf of all Bondholders) pursue potential claims against certain third parties with an aim to maximize recovery by initiating litigations against such third parties.

Only OSA Bondholders and Goliath Senior Secured

<<<

 Bondholders will be offered to subscribe for shares in the Litigation Funding SPV (as defined below). The reason is that Goliath Liquidity Bondholders pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement rank first in the waterfall when distributing net

<<<

 proceeds from a sale of the Vessel (see also allocation of recovery in Section 2.5 to the extent that the Goliath Liquidity Bonds have not been settled upon distribution of recovery proceeds).

2.2 The Litigation Funding SPV
Fees to litigation

<<<

 lawyers in relation to the contemplated litigation and fees, costs and expenses of the Litigation Funding SPV (the "Litigation Costs") will be funded by Bondholders via equity issue(s) in a new Cayman Islands special purpose vehicle (the "Litigation

<<<

 Funding SPV"). The Litigation Funding SPV will initially be incorporated and pursuant to agreement controlled by the Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders and the shares of the Litigation Funding SPV may be registered in the Securities

<<<

 Depository (VPS in Norway).

After completion of the equity issue described in section 2.3 (Equity Issue by the Litigation Funding SPV), the Litigation Funding SPV will be wholly owned (100%) by OSA Bondholders and Goliath Senior Secured Bondholders

<<<

, and detached from the NT Refectio structure, the Bond Trustee and the Bond Trustee's role as bond trustee for the Bondholders.

Goliath Liquidity Bondholders will not be offered to subscribe for shares in the Litigation Funding SPV, cf. section

<<<

 2.3 (Equity Issue by the Litigation Funding SPV) below, as Goliath Liquidity Bondholders rank first in the waterfall when distributing net proceeds from a sale of the Vessel.

2.3 Equity Issue by the Litigation Funding SPV
All OSA Bondholders

<<<

 and Goliath Senior Secured Bondholders will be given an equal right to subscribe for shares in any equity issue of the Litigation Funding SPV. The shares to be issued will be offered to Bondholders as follows:

50% of the shares will be offered

<<<

 to the OSA Bondholders, and 50% of the shares will be offered to the Goliath Senior Secured Bondholders. The shares to be held by the OSA Bondholders will be

2 (7)

allocated between the OSA Bondholders pro rata according to the aggregated

<<<

 Face Value of each OSA Bondholder's OSA Bonds at a record date to be determined by the Bond Trustee prior to completion of the equity issue, and the shares to be held by the Goliath Senior Secured Bondholders will be allocated between the Goliath

<<<

 Senior Secured Bondholders pro rata according to the aggregated Face Value of each Goliath Senior Secured Bondholder's Goliath Senior Secured Bonds at a record date to be determined by the Bond Trustee prior to completion of the equity issue

<<<

. Notice of record date will be published at www.stamdata.no by the Bond Trustee. The shares may be registered with the Securities Depository and transferred to the Bondholders in accordance with the procedures of the Securities Depository.

<<<


The Litigation Funding SPV will be subject to laws and regulations applicable to Cayman Islands exempted limited liability companies generally, hereunder provisions regarding board of directors and management of the company.
Prior to completion

<<<

 of the contemplated equity issue, the Cayman Island SPV will give further information about subscription, allocation and settlement of the equity issue. All subscriptions must include proof of holding in the OSA Bonds and/or Goliath Senior

<<<

 Secured Bonds, which must include the identity of the beneficial holder associated with the holding (including amount held per beneficial holder). If the Bonds are held in custody, i.e. owner is not registered directly in the VPS, the custodian

<<<

 must confirm (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered. As the holding in the OSA Bonds and Goliath Senior Secured Bonds is the main allocation

<<<

 criteria, subscriptions without information on beneficial holders may be discarded without further notice. Minimum subscription amount will be the USD equivalent of EUR 100,000.
The Cayman Islands SPV, in cooperation with Nordic Trustee ASA

<<<

, will prior to completion of the contemplated equity issue give information regarding relevant litigation processes to Bondholders that are interested in subscribing for shares in the equity issue, subject to signing of required non disclosure

<<<

 agreement (if applicable). Further information on subscription and access to information regarding relevant litigation processes, will, to the extent publicly available information, be posted by Nordic Trustee ASA on www.Stamdata.no following

<<<

 a decision by the Bondholder's Meeting.
2.4 Costs and expenses The Bond Trustee will enter into an agreement with the Litigation Funding SPV pursuant to which the Litigation Funding SPV will undertake to settle all Litigation Costs on a non

<<<

-recourse basis. As consideration, the Litigation Funding SPV shall receive a premium of 40% of the recovery received by/attributable to the Bond Trustee. The Litigation Funding SPV's obligations under the funding agreement may be secured by

<<<

 security over the Litigation Funding SPV's bank account into which proceeds (all or part) from the equity issue described above are deposited.
Litigation Costs (to the extent not settled by the Litigation Funding SPV) and other fees, costs

<<<

 and expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee in connection with the contemplated litigation and implementing the Proposal shall be regarded as fees, costs and expenses of the Bond Trustee under the Finance Documents. Consequently, such fees, costs

<<<

 and expenses may be deducted from any payment received by the Bond Trustee in accordance with Clause 11.6(a) of the Bond Agreements. Notwithstanding this, neither the OSA Borrower nor Goliath Offshore shall be liable for payment of fees to

<<<

 litigation lawyers.

Any Bond proceeds held by any of the OSA Borrower and Goliath Offshore may be applied towards payment of fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee in connection with incorporation of the Litigation Funding

<<<

 SPV.
2.5 Allocation of recovery The recovery received by/attributable to the Bond Trustee will be applied for the following purposes:
(a) firstly, 20% to litigators as contingency fee;
(b) secondly, 40% to Litigation Funding SPV for further

<<<

 distribution to its shareholders as dividend, distribution or redemption proceeds; and
(c) thirdly, 50% of the remaining net recovery amount to be paid to the OSA Senior Secured Bondholders and 50% to the Goliath Bondholders (or Goliath Senior

<<<

 Secured Bondholders, as described below).
(i) Any amount to be paid to the OSA Senior Secured Bondholders shall be applied towards settlement of amounts due and, if applicable, as a premium under the OSA Senior Secured Bond Agreement.
(ii)

<<<

 Any amount to be paid to the Goliath Bondholders shall be applied towards prepayment of Outstanding Bonds at a price equal to 100% of par value (to include previously capitalized interest and together with accrued and uncapitalised interest

<<<

 on the redeemed amount) and/or settlement of amounts due. Any amount to be paid to Goliath Bondholders will, if the Goliath Liquidity Bonds have not been fully settled at time of distribution of recovery, firstly be applied in or towards payment

<<<

/prepayment of the Goliath Liquidity Bonds/First Bond Obligation (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the Goliath Bond Agreements)) and thereafter towards payment/prepayment of the Goliath Senior Secured Bonds/Second Bond

<<<

 Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the Goliath Bond Agreements)) in accordance with the waterfall principles in the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the Goliath Bond Agreements). If the Goliath Liquidity

<<<

 Bonds have been fully settled at time of distribution of recovery, no amount will be paid to the Goliath Liquidity Bondholders. Any amount to be paid to the Goliath Bondholders exceeding amounts outstanding (whether due or not) (if any) shall

<<<

 be applied to the Goliath Senior Secured Bondholders as premium (on a pro rata basis) on the Goliath Senior Secured Bonds.
2.6 Voting at future Bondholders' Meetings (if any) regarding litigation Any decision regarding litigation may (at the

<<<

 Bond Trustee's sole discretion) be put forward to the Bondholders' Meeting by the Bond Trustee before the Bond Trustee takes any action. Any Bondholders' Meeting regarding litigation shall for voting purposes be considered as a joint Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting for the OSA Senior Secured Bonds and Goliath Senior Secured Bonds where resolution shall be passed by simple majority of the combined aggregate outstanding OSA Senior Secured Bonds and Goliath Senior Secured Bonds (less any Issuer

<<<

's Bond) ("Voting Bonds") represented at the Bondholders' Meeting. In order to form a quorum, at least half (1/2) of the aggregate Voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. The provisions in the relevant Bond
4 (7)

Agreements regarding

<<<

 repeated Bondholders' Meeting and voting without quorum shall apply mutatis mutandis.

Any decision regarding litigation may be made without approval by Goliath Liquidity Bondholders, and consequently no Bondholders' Meeting for or vote from

<<<

 Goliath Liquidity Bondholders is required.

3.

Potential enforcement of security

If considered necessary or advisable by the Bond Trustee to recover amounts due under the Outstanding Bonds, the Bond Trustee shall be entitled to enforce any

<<<

 Security Interest (as defined in the OSA Bond Agreement). The Bond Trustee shall be entitled to take any steps it deems necessary or desirable in respect of enforcement and recovery, including assume any rights or interest held by the Issuer

<<<

 for the purpose of seeking recovery under the Outstanding Bonds.

4.

Potential assumption of claims

If considered necessary or advisable by the Bond Trustee, the Bond Trustee (or an entity appointed by the Bond Trustee) shall be entitled

<<<

 to assume all or part of potential claims owing to the OSA Borrower by third parties. The Bond Trustee shall be entitled to take any steps it deems necessary or desirable in respect of such assignment and assumption of claims, including to

<<<

 determine consideration for such claims.
