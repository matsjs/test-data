Furthermore, the Borrower undertakes with the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that if any interest payment is made prior to 30 October 2010 in respect of the 11.0 per cent Cecon ASA Senior Secured Callable and Putable

<<<

 Bond Issue 2007/2012 (ISIN: NOOOl 03364250), then the Borrower shall, at the same time as that payment is being made, make a corresponding prorata payment of the Due Interest Amount to the Bondholders.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower

<<<

 can at its own discretion repay the Due Interest Amount (together with accrued overdue interest) prior to 30 October 2010.

Support from Bondholders
As at the date of this summons, Bondholders representing approximately 95% of the Bonds have

<<<

 confirmed to the Borrower their intention to vote in favour of the Proposal set forth in this summons.

The Borrower's evaluation of the Proposal and additional comments
Given Cecon's current liquidity position, a successful completion of the

<<<

 Proposal will be necessary for Cecon to continue its operations and further explore alternatives in relation to the on-going restructuring process of Davie Yards Inc. Although potential outcomes of such alternatives are highly uncertain, a

<<<

 failure to complete the Proposal would, in the Borrower's opinion, significantly deteriorate values for the Bondholders, as well as other stakeholders.

The Trustee's evaluation of the Proposal
The Bondholders must themselves evaluate whether

<<<

 the Proposal should be granted. It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with their own advisors and tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences of the Proposal.

To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 of the voting

<<<

 Bonds must be represented at the meeting.
0O0 Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds

<<<

 and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting. (If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the

<<<

 Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.) The individual Bondholder may authorise the Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's

<<<

 Form, authorising the Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details). In the event that Bonds

<<<

 have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the

<<<

 ownership of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Trustee, to notify the Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first

<<<

 page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
Yours sincerely, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
