REQUEST OF THE ISSUER

APPENDIX 1

[Nordic Trustee's letterhead]

1 (4)

To the bondholders in:

Helsinki, 2 September 2016

CONTAINERSHIPS PLC EUR 50,500,000 SENIOR SECURED BONDS 2015/2019, ISIN: FI4000148804 (THE "BONDS")

1. BACKGROUND
Terms

<<<

 defined in the Terms and Conditions shall have the same meaning when used in this request of the Issuer (unless otherwise defined herein).
Containerships plc (the "Issuer") has had an investment plan in place to acquire six (6) new LNGfuelled

<<<

 container vessels from China. The plan has been that four (4) of these new vessels would be acquired through operational 7 year charter agreements whereas two (2) of these new vessels would be purchased by the Issuer's Group and would be partly

<<<

 financed by the proceeds from the Bonds.
Thanks to significantly improved market conditions from the Issuer's point of view, an opportunity has now arisen to negotiate on favourable financing terms the purchase of four (4) new LNG container

<<<

 vessels and the charter of two (2) new LNG container vessels, instead of the previous plan to purchase only two (2) vessels and chartering four (4). It will be possible for the Issuer to implement the new investment plan without breaching any

<<<

 agreements made on the basis of the original investment plan. The new LNG vessels will be of same type and have the same capacity as according to the original investment plan.
The four (4) vessels to be purchased would be financed by 12 year

<<<

 charter hire agreements with an upfront payment of USD 4.8 Million per vessel against refund guarantees and a purchase obligation at the end of the 12 year charter period for USD 6.4 Million per vessel. The charter hire payments will include

<<<

 interest of 3 months LIBOR + 4.35%.
All four (4) vessels to be purchased would be delivered in 2018.
Compared to the earlier investment plan there will be a delivery delay for the delivery of the first vessel of about eleven months, due to

<<<

 the later date of effective contracts, but thereafter, thanks to competitive pricing and financing terms, the Issuer will achieve operational savings on average approx. EUR 2.1 Million per year.
The Issuer has entered into contracts with respect

<<<

 to the new investment plan but the contracts will not become effective without the advance approval by the Bondholders in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
The Issuer is of the opinion that the new investment plan described above (the

<<<

 "New Investment Plan") would be in the best interests of both the Issuer and the Bondholders.

2 (4)
The Issuer has requested the Trustee to choose a Written Procedure under which the Bondholders shall vote for the Request (as defined below

<<<

) and provide the Bondholders with necessary instructions in respect of the procedure.
2. REQUEST
The Issuer requests the consent and waiver from the Bondholders under the Terms and Conditions that the Terms and Conditions be amended as per

<<<

 Schedule 1 and the security agreement in respect of the Vessel Funding Account and the Container Funding Account (the "Security Agreement") be amended as per Schedule 2, in order for the Issuer to implement the New Investment Plan. In accordance

<<<

 with Schedule 1, beside amendments necessary to implement the New Investment Plan, the Terms and Conditions will also be amended:
(a) to include an increase of the Interest Rate on 1 August 2018, from 3M EURIBOR plus 7.5 per cent per annum

<<<

 to 3M EURIBOR plus 8.5 per cent per annum; and
(b) to reflect that the Issuer shall redeem all outstanding Bonds on the Final Redemption Date with an amount equal to 101 per cent. instead of 100 per cent. of the Outstanding Nominal Amount.

<<<


(the consent and waiver set out above jointly the "Request").
Except as set out in the Request the Bond Terms and Conditions and the Security Agreement in respect of the vessel funding account and the container funding account shall remain

<<<

 unamended.
3. AMENDMENT FEE
As a compensation to the Bondholders, the Issuer offers the Bondholders a one-time amendment fee of 0.50 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (on the date of this request of the Issuer) (the "Fee"). The Fee will

<<<

 be payable to the Bondholders on the first CSD Business Day following the scheduled Interest Payment Date on 2 October 2016 (i.e. on 3 October 2016) with Record Date on 30 September 2016 (i.e. the day a Bondholder should be registered as such

<<<

 in Euroclear Finland Oy's Book-Entry Securities System), provided that a requisite majority of the Bondholders have approved the Request.
