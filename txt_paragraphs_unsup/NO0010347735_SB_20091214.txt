To the bondholders in: ISIN NO 001 0347735 - FRN PetroProd Ltd Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012

Oslo, 14 December 2009

Proposal to enter into an agreement in relation to the FPSO Contract (as defined below

<<<

) Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

1. BACKGROUND

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"/"Norsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of bonds (the "FRN Bonds") in the above mentioned loans with ISIN NO 001 0347735 (the "FRN

<<<

 Bond Loan") where PetroProd Ltd is the borrower (the "Borrower").

All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement governing the FRN Bonds (the "Loan Agreement") or the summons to this Bondholders

<<<

' meeting unless otherwise stated.

Pursuant to a contract dated 25 October 2007 between PetroProd I Ltd (the "Company") and Jurong Shipyard Pte Limited ("Jurong") (the "FPSO Contract"), Jurong agreed to repair and convert the Aframax Vessel

<<<

 #1 to the FPSO (the "Unit").

By a mortgage dated and registered on 13 February 2009 between LAROG (Cyprus) Limited ("LAROG"), as registered owner of the Unit, and NTM, LAROG executed a first priority mortgage over the Unit in favour of NTM

<<<

 to secure the indebtedness of the Borrower to NTM (the "Mortgage"). The existing mortgage granted by the Company over the Unit also remains in place (the "PPI Mortgage").

The Company has purchased certain equipment in relation to the FPSO

<<<

 Contract (the "Equipment"), which is stored at Jurong's premises and at the warehouses of Bok Seng Logistics Pte Ltd, SDV Logistics (Singapore) Pte Ltd (Loyang and Jurong) and Yew Choon Private Limited in Singapore.

As a result of the failure

<<<

 of the Company to make timely payments under the FPSO Contract, Jurong has launched an admiralty writ in rem against the Unit before the Singapore courts. As a result, Jurong is now entitled to arrest the Unit.

2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION

Based

<<<

 on advice from AMA Capital Partners, NTM understands that, should Jurong exercise its rights in relation to the Unit in order to undertake a sale of the Unit, the incomplete state of the Unit would mean that the likely sales proceeds would

<<<

 be unlikely to provide any recoveries to the Bondholders.

Jurong is willing to enter into an agreement with NTM, the Borrower and the Company pursuant to which Jurong will pay USD12,500,000 to NTM (the "Payment") in consideration for:

(a

<<<

) the discharge of the Mortgage and the PPI Mortgage (and any other security interest over the Unit) by NTM;

(b) the transfer by LAROG to Jurong of ownership of the Unit free from all encumbrances, maritime liens and any other debts or claims

<<<

 whatsoever;

(c) the transfer by the Company to Jurong of ownership of the Equipment;

(d) the novation and/or assignment by the Borrower and the Company to Jurong of all contracts and purchase orders of all Equipment including any

<<<

 other equipment, machinery and cranes purchase or ordered by the Borrower or the Company for the FPSO Contract;

(e) NTM agreeing that any remedies, claim or rights whatsoever against Jurong with respect to or arising under or in relation to

<<<

 the FPSO Contract are deemed to be completely barred, waived and extinguished,

together the "Discharge, Transfers, Novation and Waiver".

Jurong has agreed that upon making the Payment and by entering into the Discharge, Transfers, Novation

<<<

 and Waiver, it will release the Company and the Borrower from all and any legal and/or equitable claims and actions with respect to or arising from the FPSO Contract and the FPSO Contract will be deemed mutually terminated.

It is therefore

<<<

 proposed that the Bondholders authorise NTM to enter into such agreements with the Borrower, the Company and Jurong as are necessary to give effect to the terms set out above.

3. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO BE MADE

Certain additional payments

<<<

 will also need to be made by the Borrower as part of this settlement arrangement. These payments will be made out of free cash at the Borrower, but will then be reimbursed by the Loan Trustee from the proceeds of enforcement over the FRN Bond

<<<

 escrow account.

The additional payments are as follows:

Goltens Claim

Goltens Singapore Pte Ltd ("Goltens") has brought an in rem action against the Unit before the Singapore courts. Jurong requires this claim to be settled and the suit

<<<

 discontinued before proceeding with the settlement agreement.

In order to settle this claim, it will be necessary for Goltens to be paid a sum in the region of US$60,000 (based on current exchange rates from Singapore dollars to US dollars

<<<

).

Warehouse Payments

Certain amounts are owing to warehouses in Singapore where equipment relating to the Unit has been stored. Amounts outstanding and payable to the warehouses for storage costs until 31 December 2009 have been confirmed

<<<

 directly with the warehouses and are as follows:

SDV Yew Choon Bok Seng TOTAL

S$493,766.36 S$225,413.05 S$215,712.00 S$934,891.41

This amounts to a payment of approximately US$672,000 (the actual amount could change due to exchange rate

<<<

 fluctuations). Jurong will attempt to secure a discount on these costs, but there is no guarantee that it will be possible to do so.

Accordingly, payments in the region of US$732,000 will

<<<

 need to be made out of FRN Bond recoveries in order for the Jurong settlement to take place. This means that the net recoveries for the FRN Bondholders from the Jurong settlement will be in the region of US$11.75 million. The net recoveries

<<<

 could be higher than US$11.75 million if Jurong is able to obtain a discount from the warehouses.
