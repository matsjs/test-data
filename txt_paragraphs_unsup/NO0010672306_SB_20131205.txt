To approve the Proposal, Bondholders representing at least half (1/2)

 of the Voting Bonds in each Tranche represented in person or by proxy at the Bondholders' Meeting for that Tranche must vote in favour o f the Proposal. In order to have a quorum, at least half (1/2) of the Voting Bonds of each Tranche must

 be represented at the Bondholders' Meeting. If the Proposal is not adopted by each o f the meeting of Bondholders in the Tranche A Bonds, the meeting of Bondholders in the Tranche B Bonds and the meeting of Bondholders in the Tranche B2 Bonds

, the Proposal will be dismissed and the First Amended Bond Loan Agreement will remain effective unchanged.
Please find attached as Schedule 1 a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing

 date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.c. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm

<<<

; (i) the owner o f the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds arc registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case

<<<

 the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising NTM to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the

<<<

 first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case

<<<

 may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership o f the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond

<<<

 Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by email (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.

CECON ASA Highlights:

8 November 2013

· Rever agrees

<<<

 to restructuredfinancing, securing earlier start-up of the completion of hull 718, and enhancedflexibility in construction and working capitalfinancing
· The restructuring includes raising USD 8 million in additional bonds with warrants to

<<<

 finance the completion of hull 717 in a fully underwritten offering
Cecon ASA ("Cecon"), through its subsidiary Rever Offshore AS ("Rever"), has reached an agreement to restructure and extend the existing financing (the "Restructuring") related

<<<

 to the construction of their three offshore construction vessels (hulls 717, 718, and 719) at Chantier Davie yard in Quebec, Canada The Restructuring provides Rever with necessary working capital financing, allowing Rever tc fund start-up costs

<<<

 of 717 and initiate the completion of hulls 718 and 719 earlier than under the current financing, which is expected to reduce overall construction cost and expedite the delivery of the vessels. The key elements of the Restructuring can be summarized

<<<

 as follows:

· The previously secured financing from funds managed by York Capital Management Global Advisors, LLC and its affiliates ("York") which is due and payable upon the delivery of 717, is to be supplemented by additional bonds in principal

<<<

 amount of USD 8 million (the "Additional 717 Bonds"), which will be used for completion of hull 717 and for working capital purposes. The Additional 717 Bonds will mature in June 2015. The Additional 717 Bonds have a 12% coupon, paid in kind

<<<

 until delivery of hull 717, and detachable warrants with a strike price of NOK 5,000 per Rever share, or an implicit pre money valuation of Rever of USD 30 million. These warrants will expire on 31 December 2015, and if exercised, proceeds

<<<

 will equal USD 8 million.

Cecon will not purchase the Additional 717 Bonds and warrants and, accordingly, Cecon's ownership in Rever will be reduced from 85% to 67% if all warrants are exercised. However, Cecon's share of the Additional 7

<<<

17 bonds and the warrants will be offered as a stapled deal to the largest shareholders and warrant holders of Cecon and, consequently, the offer is exempted from the Norwegian prospectus requirements.

The Additional 717 Bonds issue is fully

<<<

 underwritten, by funds managed by York, by funds managed by Warwick Capital Partners LLP, and by companies affiliated with Chairman Riulf Rustad.

The issuance of Additional 717 Bonds and warrants will be subject to definitive documentation

<<<

, including amending and restating the existing First Bond Loan Agreement. Accordingly, the Additional 717 Bonds will be subject to the same security package and restrictions contained in the First Bond Loan Agreement and related documentation

<<<

. The warrants shall (if possible) be registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository [VPS).·

· The previously secured financing of hull 718, has been re-structured such that a new separate facility of USD 25 million has been secured

<<<

 for a start-up of hull 718 in early December 2013, while the remainder of the financing for hull 718 will be available from after refinancing and delivery of hull 717. In addition, the new 718 financing includes a flexible extension facility

<<<

 of USD 15 million from January 2015. The total funds available under the

Page 1 of 2

new hull 718 financing is increased to USD 95 million; USD 5 million of which will be available for working capital purposes. The terms of the new 718 financing

<<<

 are better than the previous secured financing, with comparable cost and increased flexibility to Rever, and will be subject to definitive documentation (including amending and restating the existing First Bond Loan Agreement).
· Discussions

<<<

 for concluding the financing of hull 719 are expected to be finalized before 31 December at improved terms and conditions compared to the existing facility contemplated for hull 719.
· The Restructuring gives Rever and the Cecon group the financial

<<<

 flexibility to manage the construction process and the commercial development of the company in an optimal manner. The Restructuring secures Rever with minimum USD 8 million in working capital to enable Rever to properly supervise the construction

<<<

 and commercialization of the vessels.
The construction of hull 717 is on schedule for delivery by March 2014. The total price including variation orders is expected to be within 10% of the earlier communicated shipyard price. The final contract

<<<

 for construction of hull 718 and hull 719 is in final phases of negotiation.
