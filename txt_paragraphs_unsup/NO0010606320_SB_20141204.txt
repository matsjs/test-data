<<<

 meaning assigned to them in the bond agreements (as amended) dated 9 December 2013 (each a "Bond Agreement" and together, the "Bond Agreements"), respectively, unless otherwise stated herein.

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer

<<<

 and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1 BACKGROUND
1.1 Introduction
On 1 October 2014, Noreco informed of expected impairments of its

<<<

 Oselvar and Huntington fields. At the same time the Company informed of uncertainty with respect to whether the Company would be able to meet its financial covenants year-end 2014 due to lower production on Huntington. The Company also communicated

<<<

 that the impairments are expected to result in significant negative impact on Noreco's cash-flow in 2015 and beyond.
Further update was given on 15 October 2014, whereby Noreco informed about negative developments in the performance of Noreco

<<<

's producing fields, which had further added to the challenge in meeting cash covenants, and making it unlikely that the Company would be able to comply with its cash covenants towards the end of 2014 and through 2015.

1

The Company has in

<<<

 recent months worked intensively on potential mitigating actions and solutions addressing its financial position. The efforts have included strategic opportunities and discussions with parties interested in the shares o f the Company and/or

<<<

 selected assets of the Group. Although the aim has been to present a timely solution to the Company's stakeholders, it has not been possible to conclude such opportunities and discussions and present a proposal to the stakeholders in time to

<<<

 avoid covenant default under the Company's financing arrangements. In order to allow the Company necessary time to explore all alternatives to a financial restructuring and with the belief that such alternatives may create or preserve more

<<<

 values for all stakeholders compared to a restructuring, Noreco reported on 19 November 2014 that it would seek a deferral o f instalments (NOK 560.8 million) and interest (NOK 84.6 million) due on 9 December 2014 under the Bonds. The deferral

<<<

 is required as the Company in light o f its current financial position and outlook is unable to make such payments without breaching its cash covenants at the end o f 2014 and through 2015 and without prejudicing certain groups of creditors

<<<

.
On the above basis, Noreco is hereby putting forward a request to the Bondholders for a deferral o f instalment payments as further described below in Section 2 below and in Schedule B hereto (Noreco Waiver and Deferral Terms). The Company

<<<

 has also requested and received a waiver under the group's exploration loan facility with respect to its requirement to submit a 12 months funded business plan.
For further information on the above mentioned issues and other updates, please

<<<

 refer to the Company's recent stock exchange announcements and the Company's financial reports, available on www. newsweb.no.
Particular attention is drawn to the Company's latest interim report for Q3 2014 published on 28 November 2014, also

<<<

 available on www.newsweb.no and www.noreco.com.
2 THE PROPOSAL
The Company has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting for each o f the Bonds in order to consider the Company's request to defer payments o f instalments

<<<

 due on 9 December 2014 under the NOR06 Bond and NOR10 Bond and to provide certain waivers for all Bonds, pursuant to the authority given to the Bondholders' Meeting under the Bond Agreements.
Pursuant to the information provided herein, the

<<<

 Issuer requests that:
(a) the Bondholders o f each o f the NOR06 Bonds and the NOR10 Bonds adopt the necessary resolutions to amend the terms and conditions o f the Bond Agreements to cater for the Deferral (as defined in Schedule B hereto

<<<

);
(b) the Bondholders o f each o f the NOR06 Bonds, the NOR10 Bonds, the NOR11 Bonds and the NOR 12 Bonds adopt the necessary resolutions to amend the terms and conditions o f the Bond Agreements to grant the W aiver (as defined in Schedule

<<<

 B hereto); and
(c) the Bondholders o f each o f the NOR06 Bonds, the NOR10 Bonds, the NOR11 Bonds and NOR12 Bonds adopt the necessary resolutions to amend the notice period for a Bondholders' Meeting to a minimum o f five Business Days prior

<<<

 to the date o f the Bondholders' Meeting for which summons have been dispatched on or prior to the New Amortisation Date.
in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Noreco Waiver and Deferral Terms attached hereto

<<<

 as Schedule B (together the "Proposal").
The Deferred Payments shall be made to such persons who are entitled to receive the instalment payments on the New Amortisation Date (as defined in Schedule B).
1

The Bond Trustee shall be authorised

<<<

, at its discretion, to consent to amendments to the terms and conditions o f the Proposal and/or the Bond Agreement on behalf o f the Bondholders where such amendments (i) are o f a minor or technical nature, (ii) are otherwise consistent with

<<<

 the Proposal and are required in order to implement the Proposal, or (iii) would not adversely affect the position o f the Bondholders. The Bond Trustee shall be authorised to document the Proposal by way o f addendums or amendment agreements

<<<

 to the Bond Agreements or otherwise.

Other than any amendments prompted by the Proposal, the terms and conditions o f the Bond Agreements will remain unchanged and continue to apply in their existing form.

An adoption o f the Proposal in

<<<

 each o f the Bonds shall be subject to the adoption also by the three other Bonds.

The amendments to the Bond Agreements pursuant to the Proposal shall take effect immediately upon and subject to approval by Bondholders' Meetings in each o

<<<

4 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

<<<



In the Issuer's opinion, the Proposal represents the best alternative given the current circumstances. On the one hand it will allow the Company to continue to explore alternatives and prepare solutions which can create or preserve more values

<<<

 for all stakeholders in the current situation. On the other hand it will also give Bondholders and its advisors the opportunity to seek further information about the Company and thus enable more informed decisions and avoid any action which

<<<

 may prove value destructive.

The Proposal will allow the Company to continue operations as a going concern whilst these efforts are ongoing, while at the same time ensuring comfort for Bondholders through increased information and advisor

<<<

 participation.

The Proposal has been discussed with the Bond Trustee and Akin Gump and BAHR as appointed legal

advisors to the Bond Trustee and Rothschild as appointed financial advisor, who in turn have discussed with an ad hoc committee

<<<

 o f Bondholders under the Bonds. The Issuer has been informed by the Bond Trustee that the ad hoc committee o f Bondholders has expressed its support for the Proposal as set forth herein, and that they intend to vote in favour o f the Proposal

<<<

. The members o f the ad hoc committee represent a significant majority o f the Bonds across all Bond Issues.

5 NON-RELIANCE
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee

<<<

, and the Bond Trustee emphasizes that each Bondholder should cast its vote in the Bondholders' meeting based on its own evaluation of the Proposal. Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The

<<<

 Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable and vote accordingly. The Bond Trustee urges each Bondholder to seek advice in order to evaluate the Proposal.
