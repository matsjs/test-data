 The Scope of the Amendment Agreement
The Amendment Agreement sets out certain amendments to the loan agreement dated 13 June 2008 in respect of "IS1N NO 0010431315 - FRN Master Marine AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2008/2011" (the "Loan

<<<

 Agreement"), which amendments have been approved by the holders of all the outstanding Bonds (as defined in the Loan Agreement).
Capitalized terms and expressions used herein shall bear the meaning ascribed to such terms and expressions in

<<<

 the Loan Agreement unless otherwise defined herein.
Clause 21 of the Loan Agreement shall apply to this Amendment Agreement, as if references in that clause to the "Loan Agreement" were to this Amendment Agreement.
2. Amendment to the Loan

<<<

 Agreement
The Loan Agreement shall with effect from the date hereof be amended as follows:
In Clause 2, the first paragraph shall be replaced with:
The Borrower has resolved to issue a series of Bonds at a maximum amount of EUR 60,000,000 

<<<

(Euro sixty million), herein referred to as the "Loan". The payment of interest may partly be paid as additional Bonds (Payment-in-Kind, cf Clause 9.1), which shall be deemed to constitute a part of the Loan.
In Clause 2, the second paragraph

<<<

 shall be replaced with:
"The Bond will be in denominations of EUR 1.00 each and shall rank pari passu among themselves."
In Clause 9.1, the following shall be added as a new fourth paragraph:
"If the Loan Trustee serves a written notice on

<<<

 the Securities Depository and the Borrower, substantially in the form as set out in Schedule 1 attached hereto, at least ten Banking Days prior to an Interest Payment Date, the interest due at that Interest Payment Date shall be capitalised

<<<

 rank pari passu with the Bonds already issued under this Loan Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no such waiver of payment of interest shall be deemed as a consent to a permanent amendment to Clause 9 of the Loan Agreement with
