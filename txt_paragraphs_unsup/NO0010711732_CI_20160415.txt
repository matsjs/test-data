To the bondholders in:
FRN Golden Energy Offshore Services AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2014/2017 with ISIN NO 001 0711732 (the "Bond Agreement")
Oslo, 15 April 2016
RE: ANNOUNCEMENT OF OFFER TO BUY-BACK BONDS THROUGH REVERSE AUCTION

<<<


All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement unless otherwise stated.
On 11 March 2016, a bondholders' meeting was summoned (the "Summons"). The proposed resolution was adopted by the Bondholders

<<<

 in the bondholders' meeting held on 30 March 2016.
As a condition for the effectiveness of the amendments to the Bond Agreement, Golden Energy Offshore Services AS (the "Issuer") must redeem Outstanding Bonds (as of 10 March 2016) at a minimum

<<<

 nominal amount of NOK 100 million within 25 April 2016. Golden Energy Offshore Holdings (Norway) AS ("GEOH") hereby offer to make such purchase of Bonds at a price of up to 30% of par value (inclusive of an amount equal to the Interest Claim

<<<

 as defined below and all accrued interest and other rights attached to them), pursuant to the terms set out in the Summons and summarised below (the "Buy-back Offer").
It is a condition for the effectiveness of the Buy-back Offer and the amendments

<<<

 to the Bond Agreement that the Bondholders tender Bonds with a nominal value of at least NOK 100 million. The Bondholders are hereby invited to tender all or any part of its Bonds for sale at a price of up to 30% of par value (inclusive of

<<<

 an amount equal to the Interest Claim as defined below and all accrued interest and other rights attached to them) (the "Tender"). A potential buy-back will be carried out as a reverse auction, in which GEOH will buy back the Bonds tendered

<<<

 at the lowest prices first and then allocate pro rata between the Bonds tendered, up to the nominal total amount of NOK 100 million. Hence, the Buy-back Offer will be made to all Bondholders on equal terms, in which it is the price offered

<<<

 by each of the tendering Bondholders that determine both the buy-back price (i.e. the buy-back may be completed at different prices) and the allocation of buy-back Bonds. By submitting a Tender before the deadline for the tender period set

<<<

 out in the below section Tender Procedure Information, the offering Bondholder irrevocably commits itself to the terms and conditions of the Tender.
If the total amount of tenders from the Bondholders exceeds a nominal value of NOK 100 million

<<<

, GEOH may determine in its sole discretion whether and to which extent it shall buy back exceeding Bonds. Should sufficient Bonds not be tendered, GEOH shall have the option, but not be required, to complete a buy-back of the Bonds actually

<<<

 tendered. In any event, the Buy-back Offer shall not involve buy back of any Bonds tendered at a price higher than 30 % of par value (inclusive of an amount equal to the Interest Claim as defined below and all accrued interest and other rights

<<<

 attached to them).
The Issuer did not make the interest payment on the Interest Payment Date on 29 February 2016, and a separate claim on the interest payment was established (the "Interest Claim") whereby subject to the amendments to the Bond

<<<

 Agreement becoming effective - the Issuer will pay interest at an interest rate of 5 per cent with retroactive effect from and including 30 November 2015 to 29

#6435956/1

1 (4)

February 2016 (91/360 days) to the holders of such Interest

<<<

 Claim. Such payment will be made on 29 April 2016.
As a result of a potential buy-back the Bonds acquired by GEOH shall be transferred to GEOH free of any encumbrances. For technical settlement reasons, the Interest Claim cannot be transferred

<<<

 to GEOH as part of the buy-back of Bonds and will instead be compensated to the selling Bondholders through the Issuer's payment of the April Payment (as defined above). Hence, the Manager will ensure that the Interest Claim will be deducted

<<<

 in the settlement price payable to the selling Bondholders.
It has been considered most economically efficient for the Issuer (and thus been considered in the interest of both the Bondholders and the Issuer) that a potential buy-back is completed

<<<

 with the Issuer's grandmother company GEOH as buyer, instead of the Issuer as stated in the Summons. Such transaction structure will ensure that the Bonds being part of a potential buy-back will be discharged and result in the number of Outstanding

<<<

 Bonds being reduced with the same number of Bonds in the buy-back. Technically, such discharge will be ensured as follows:
 Issuer undertakes that GEOH may convert its claim against theIssuer as result ofa buy-back into shares as contribution

<<<

 in kind in the Issuer immediately following the buy-back of Bonds;

 Thereafter, GEOH's holding of shares in the Issuer will be transferred to the Issuer's parent company Golden Energy Offshore AS ("GEO"), which will result in GEO being the

<<<

 sole shareholder in the Issuer. The new shares will become part of the share pledge;

 The Bonds being part of the buy-back will be discharged.

 The Issuer's cost related to payment of Interest Claim to the sellingBondholders' shall be compensated

<<<

 by GEOH through a subsequent capital increase in the Issuer (which for the avoidance of doubt will be in an amount equal to the Interest Claim paid to the selling Bondholders).
