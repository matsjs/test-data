Oslo, 14 February 2014
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Prolongation of term and increase of maximum loan amount
1. INTRODUCTION Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed

<<<

 as Bond Trustee for the above mentioned Bond Issue. Terms defined in the Bond Agreement shall have the same meaning when used herein. The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and

<<<

 the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information. 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION The Issuer currently has two bond issues, the Bond Issue and the "25 per cent Emerging Europe Land Development AS Callable

<<<

 Open Bond Issue 2012/2014 (the "Second Priority Bond Issue"). The maturity date for the Bond Issue is 3 March 2014, while the maturity date for the Second Priority Bond Issue is 1 March 2014. As 1 March 2014 is not a business day, the maturity

<<<

 date will in practice be 3 March 2014 for both bond issues. The grand opening of the Issuer's commercial shopping center Lumini is drawing close and the Issuer does not have the necessary funds available to repay its bond issues on the maturity

<<<

 date. Consequently the Issuer requests that the maturity date for the Bond Issue is extended to 1 March 2017. Furthermore the Issuer requests that the aggregate amount of the Bond Issue is increased from NOK 70 million to NOK 96 million in

<<<

 order to enable the Issuer to issue additional tranches to fund the continued development of the Lumini project and the Issuer in general. The proposed prolonged term of the Bond Issue is also proposed to the bondholders in the Second Priority

 Bond Issue.
