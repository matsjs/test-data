The Agent

<<<

<<<

.
To be eligible to participate in the Written Procedure, a person must meet the criteria for being a Holder on 18 November 2016 (the "Record Date"). This means that the person must be registered on a Securities Account with the CSD, as a direct

<<<

 registered owner (Sw. direktregistrerad ägare) or authorised nominee (Sw. förvaltare) with respect to one or several Bonds.

This Notice has been prepared solely by the Issuer and, as the case may be, its advisors. The Agent expressly disclaims

<<<

 any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. Background
Building on previous acquisitions and significant market share gains in the U.S., the Issuer has a positive momentum and is evaluating additional profitable growth opportunities

<<<

. The focus remains on accretive acquisitions of profitable brands which can be easily integrated in the Issuer's existing infrastructure.
As an example of this, in September 2016, the Issuer secured an exclusive option from Prestige Brands

<<<

, valid up to 31 December 2017, to acquire Dermoplast. Dermoplast is a brand with highly attractive margins, stable cash flow and which comprise a strong strategic fit with the Issuer's focus in dermatology.
To be able to fully utilise its outstanding

<<<

 bond facility for accretive acquisition opportunities currently under evaluation, the Issuer requests that the Holders agree to waive certain conditions in the Terms and Conditions to the effect that, provided that certain requirements are

<<<

 met as set forth in the Requests (as defined below), Subsequent Bonds may be issued at one occasion, subject to a modified Incurrence Test pursuant to which item (a) of the Incurrence Test, i.e., the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA

<<<

, shall not be greater than four point five (4.50) (calculated pro forma in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, including any Subsequent Bonds issued and any assets acquired).
Under the Terms and Conditions, additional debt, including

<<<

 Subsequent Bonds, can only be incurred if the Incurrence Test is met. The Incurrence Test is met if the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA is not greater than three point five (3.50) and Interest Coverage Ratio exceeds two point five

<<<

 (2.50) (calculated pro forma in accordance with the Terms and Conditions).
Subject to the Holder's approval of the Requests (as defined below), the modified Incurrence Test will read as follows:
"Modified Incurrence Test" is met if (a) the

<<<

 ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA is not greater than four point five (4.50), and (b) the Interest Coverage Ratio exceeds two point five (2.50) (in both cases, calculated in accordance with the Calculation Principles).
Other definitions

<<<

 relevant for the understanding of the Modified Incurrence Test are set out in Schedule 3, and are unaltered in relation to their wording in the Terms and Conditions.
The Requests (as defined below) have received pre-acceptance from key Holders

<<<

. When issuing this Notice, the Issuer has already received irrevocable undertakings to vote in favour of the Requests (as defined below) from Holders representing approximately thirty three (33) per cent. of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount

<<<

.
2. Waivers of the Terms and Conditions
In order to obtain a flexible financing structure, the Issuer requests the Holders to approve the waiver set out in item A ("Request A") and the waiver set out in item B ("Request B") below. Request A

<<<

 and Request B are together referred to as the "Requests".
2 (7)

A. The Issuer shall be permitted to, at one occasion, resolve upon and issue Subsequent Bonds in an aggregate amount of up to SEK 215,000,000, represented by Bonds, each of a

<<<

 nominal amount of SEK 1,000,000, in accordance with Section 2.2 of the Terms and Conditions, subject to a modified Incurrence Test pursuant to which item (a) of the Incurrence Test, i.e., the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA, shall

<<<

 not be greater than four point five (4.50) (calculated pro forma in accordance with the Terms and Conditions) (together with item (b) of the Incurrence Test, the "Modified Incurrence Test") (the "Subsequent Bond Issue") (for the avoidance of

<<<

 doubt, the Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer as a result of the Subsequent Bond Issue shall constitute Permitted Debt if such Financial Indebtedness would meet the Modified Incurrence Test calculated pro forma in accordance with

<<<

 the Terms and Conditions), provided however that:
(i) the Subsequent Bond Issue is completed before 31 December 2017;
(ii) the Issuer applies the proceeds from the Subsequent Bond Issue towards acquisition of one or more profitable brands,

<<<

 i.e., brands or assets which have a positive EBITDA history and are projected to bring a positive EBITDA contribution already in the twelve (12) months post closing of the acquisition, provided however that not more than sixty five (65.00)

<<<

 per cent. of such acquisition shall be financed with proceeds from the Subsequent Bond Issue; and
(iii) all persons who are registered as Holders in the Issuer's debt register kept by Euroclear Sweden on the Consent Fee Record Date (as defined

<<<

 below), receive the Consent Fee (as defined below).
B. The Issuer shall be permitted to pay the Consent Fee (as defined below) in accordance with Section 5 (Consent Fee) below, regardless of Section 14.12 of the Terms and Conditions, whereby

<<<

 the Holders accept to waive any provision of Section 14.12 of the Terms and Conditions in order to permit the payment of the Consent Fee (as defined below) being (a) conditional upon the Subsequent Bond Issue being carried out in accordance

<<<

 with Request A and (b) payable to all persons who are registered as Holders in the Issuer's debt register kept by Euroclear Sweden on the Consent Fee Record Date (as defined below).
The Holders' approval of the Requests shall constitute a required

<<<

 waiver in relation to any Event of Default under the Terms and Conditions, which could otherwise occur due to the Issuer's implementation of the Requests.
3. Conditions
The Issuer acknowledges that the agreement by the Holders to the Requests

<<<

 is subject to that both Request A and Request B are approved.
The Issuer further acknowledges that, regardless of the Requests being approved by the Holders, the Issuer shall not carry out the Subsequent Bond Issue unless the conditions set

<<<

 forth in items (i)-(iii) of Request A are fulfilled.
For the avoidance of doubt, the aforesaid (including the Requests being approved by the Holders) shall not in any way limit the Issuer to issue Subsequent Bonds without
3 (7)

utilisation

<<<

 of the waivers set out in Request A and Request B if such issuance would meet the original Incurrence Test as set forth in the Terms and Conditions.
4. Consent
We kindly ask the Holders to confirm that the Holders, subject to Clause 3, agree

<<<

 to the Requests.
5. Consent Fee
Subject to that a requisite majority of the Holders have approved the Requests, all persons who are registered as Holders in the Issuer's debt register kept by Euroclear Sweden on a record date falling approximately

<<<

 with Request A), will receive a consent fee in the amount of zero point five (0.50) per cent. of the Nominal Amount of the Bonds held on the Consent Fee Record Date (the "Consent Fee"). The payment of the Consent Fee is conditional upon that

<<<

 the Subsequent Bond Issue is carried out by the Issuer in accordance with Request A, for the avoidance of doubt with an application of the Modified Incurrence Test.
Any decision by the Issuer to carry out the Subsequent Bond Issue will be announced

<<<

 by the Issuer by way of a press release. Such press release will also contain detailed information regarding the actual Consent Fee Record Date and the date of payment of the Consent Fee. The Consent Fee Record Date is expected to occur three

<<<

 (3) Business Days after the date of the abovementioned press release and the payment of the Consent Fee is expected to be made on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Consent Fee Record Date through Euroclear Sweden's account based system

<<<

.
6. Non-reliance
The Requests are presented to the Holders by the Issuer, without any evaluation, advice or recommendations from the Agent whatsoever. No independent advisor has been appointed to review and/or analyse the Requests (and their

<<<

 effects) from the Holders' perspective. The Holders are recommended to seek legal advice to independently evaluate whether the Requests from the Issuer (and their effects) are acceptable or not.
7. Written Procedure

<<<

 need to be adhered to under the Written Procedure.
7.1 Final date to participate in the Written Procedure

<<<

 2016. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.
7.2 Decision procedure
The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate under the Written Procedure as valid votes.
4 (7)

When a requisite majority of consents of

<<<

 the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent, the Requests shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
Information about the decision taken under the

<<<

 Written Procedure will (i) be sent by notice to the Holders and (ii) be published on the websites of (a) the Issuer and (b) the Agent.
A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Holders, irrespective of them responding

<<<

 in the Written Procedure.
7.3 Voting rights and authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (18 November 2016) in the debt register:
(a) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities

<<<

 Account; or
(b) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.
7.4 Bonds registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a

<<<

 registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its

<<<

 own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries

<<<

, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as holder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered

<<<

 in the debt register as a holder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other

<<<

 intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you

<<<

 wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or their Affiliates do not entitle to any

<<<

 voting rights.

7.5 Quorum
To approve the Requests, Holders representing at least twenty (20.00) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the Requests under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.
If a quorum does

<<<

 not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure.
7.6 Majority
Two thirds (2/3) of the

<<<

 Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Holders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to Request A and fifty (50.00) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Holders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to Request B.

<<<
