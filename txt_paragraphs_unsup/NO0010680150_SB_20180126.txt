Nordic Trustee AS ("Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders of bonds

 (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issues with ISIN NO 001 0680150 and NO 001 0757248 (with total outstanding amount of USD 94,655,000), NO 001 0714389 and NO 001 0757255 (with total outstanding amount of NOK 348,640,000) and NO

<<<

"). The Issuer and its subsidiaries are referred to as the "Group", the bonds issued under the above mentioned bond issues are jointly referred to as the "Bonds" and the bond issues as the "Bond Issues".
, The information in this summons regarding

<<<

 the Issuer; the proposed Restructuring and
Proposals and market conditions are provided by the Issuer and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information. To enable the Issuer to conduct the Restructuring

<<<

 and the proposed amendments to the Bond Agreements, the Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes.
1. BACKGROUND
1.1 Introduction
Polarcus (OSE: PLCS) is an innovative

<<<

 marine geophysical company, delivering high-end towed streamer data acquisition and imaging services through the operation of a fleet of high performance 3D seismic vessels. Polarcus offers contract seismic surveys and multi client projects

<<<

 with advanced on-board processing solutions and employs over 400 professionals worldwide.
The Group has been adversely impacted by the severe industry downturn, where the

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls g ale 1, Oslo

nordictrustee

<<<

.com

significant decline in the price of oil has caused depressed levels of seismic spending by oil companies, and a knock on reduction in demand for the Group's services and lower vessel rates. The industry downturn has led to several seismic

<<<

 vessels being coldstacked, including Polarcus Nadia. The market conditions continue to be challenging and consistent with its peers, the Group has considerable levels of debt (both to lease providers, bank lenders and bondholders) including

<<<

 (i) USD 102 million of secured convertible bonds issued by the Company, (ii) NOK 349 million of senior unsecured bonds issued by the Company; (iii) USD 95 million of senior unsecured bonds issued by the Company, (iv) USD 254 million of secured

<<<

 bank facilities and (v) USD 89 million of vessel leases (together the "Debt").
The lease, interest and amortization burden emanating from the Debt is considerable. With USD 31 million scheduled payments in 2018 and USD 89 million in 2019, the

<<<

 Company's current capital structure is unsustainable in current market. Whilst macro factors impact the Company's net profitability, a cost management program has reduced costs to a level where the operations are cash positive before debt service

<<<

 and the Group's management remains convinced that with a reduced debt burden, the Group has the capacity to continue to perform as a going concern. The Board of Directors of the Company believes that maintaining this going concern status will

<<<

 provide the best prospects of recovery for all stakeholders.
With this in mind, the Group has engaged specialist advisors to assist it in dealing with its debt and lease obligations and associated restructuring plans (the "Restructuring").

<<<


1,2 Key terms of the Restructuring
Below follows a summary of the main features of the proposed Restructuring. Please refer to the restructuring term sheet in Annex A (the "Restructuring Term Sheet") for a complete overview. Terms used in this

<<<

 summons have the same meaning as in the Restructuring Term Sheet unless defined herein:
· MUSD 410 Facility Agreement: General extension of the fixed amortization freeze until 1 January 2022 from the current 1 January 2019, reducing fixed instalments

<<<

 between 2019 and 2021 by approximately USD 79 million. During this period, the principal part of one loan within the MUSD 410 Facility Agreement will receive fixed amortisation for the period that "Ivan Gubkin" is on a long term bareboat charter

<<<

. The lenders will participate in the Cash Sweep, as described below. Postponed amortisation payments will be added to the payment due on the maturity date.
The bank lenders have also agreed to reduce the interest payable under the MUSD 410

<<<

 Facility Agreement. In addition, the debt service ratio, minimum equity ratio and minimum market value covenants will be removed. Other covenants will be amended so as to provide the Company with greater operational flexibility, even in a flat

<<<

 market environment.
· Working capital facility: The Company's working capital facility will be increased to USD 40 million from the current USD 25 million and extended to 30 June 2022 from the current 1 July 2019.
· Swap termination: The Company

<<<

 has concluded negotiations with DNB Bank ASA to terminate the Company's swap and credit support arrangement including a cross currency swap provided thereunder. The Company is required to pay a termination fee which will be covered by a new

<<<

 facility provided by DNB Bank ASA in an amount limited to USD 7.832 million. Any excess amounts will be paid in cash and the Company may use any amounts posted as collateral to cover any excess amounts outstanding. The new facility will amortize

<<<

 by USD 2 million on 30 June 2019, USD
-2-

3 million on 30 June 2020 and USD 2.832 million on 30 June 2021 (adjusted for the actual cost of termination). Interest payable on the new facility will be USD LIBOR +4%. The Company estimates that

<<<

 the termination costs will be approximately USD 7.5 million.
· Secured Bonds (tranche A under the Convertible Bond Issue): Amendments to tranche A under the Convertible Bond Issue include a reduction in fixed amortisation payments servicing

<<<

 tranche A to USD 4.6 million per annum for the period that "Vyacheslav Tikhonov" remains on a long term bareboat charter. If the vessel is not on a bareboat charter, tranche A bondholders will not receive fixed amortisation but will receive

<<<

 interest at a reduced rate and participate in the Cash Sweep described below. Postponed amortisation payments will be added to the payment due on the maturity date. The maturity date will be extended to 1 July 2022 from current 30 March 20

<<<

22.
· Unsecured Bonds: The total outstanding principal amount under each tranche of the Unsecured Bonds will be reduced to the applicable call price level for that tranche in 2018 and the call price for the Unsecured Bonds will be increased

<<<

 to 100% of par value after the reduction of the nominal amount. The Unsecured Bonds will receive interest of 5% p.a. as payment in kind and the maturity date will be extended to 1 January 2025 from current 30 December 2022. Certain covenants

<<<

 and restrictions will be removed as further set out in the Restructuring Term Sheet.
Holders of Unsecured Bonds will furthermore be offered the choice between two alternatives:
o Alternative 1 is to continue to hold Unsecured Bond on the amended

<<<

 terms set out above.
o Alternative 2 provides an opportunity to convert Unsecured Bonds into equity after the reduction of principal value as set out above has been carried out. Upon conversion, Unsecured Bonds to be converted will be valued

<<<

 at 70% of nominal value after the reduction of principal value. The conversion price will correspond to the subscription price in the Private Placement (as defined below). The option to convert Unsecured Bonds to equity is limited to 50% of

<<<

 the total outstanding amount of the Unsecured Bonds. Bondholders who wish to convert Unsecured Bonds to equity will have to fill out the application agreement in Annex C (the "Application Agreement") before the expiry of the application period

<<<

 set out therein.
No cash payments will be made in respect of the Unsecured Bonds from 31 December 2017 until maturity.
· Sale leaseback termination: The Company has reached an agreement with GSH2 Seismic Carrier I AS ("GSH") to take ownership

<<<

 of "Polarcus Nadia" and "Polarcus Naila" which are currently operated under long-term leases. The purchase will be fully financed by a new loan, maturing in 2024, on terms substantially similar to the MUSD 410 Facility Agreement (the "New Fleet

<<<

 Facility"). The aggregate purchase price for the two vessels is USD 75 million and the existing long-term leases will be terminated. GSH will receive warrants for 2.5% of the Company's outstanding share capital after the Restructuring with

<<<

 a strike price per share equal to three times the subscription price in the Private Placement. The warrants are exercisable until 30 November 2022 and the agreement with GSH also includes a profit split mechanism in case agreement to sell any

<<<

 of the vessels is entered into by the Company on or before 31 December 2018.
· Cash Sweep: A new cash sweep will be introduced in which the lenders under the
-3 -

MUSD 410 Facility Agreement, bondholders in tranche A of the Convertible Bond

<<<

 Issue and lenders under the New Fleet Facility will participate. Participation in the cash sweep will principally be based on the vessel which is the main collateral for the relevant loan not being on a bareboat charter. The Cash Sweep will

<<<

 only be triggered if the Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Restructuring Term Sheet) from the Group is positive for the preceding financial year, in which case, 70% of the Excess Cash Flow will be distributed on an annual basis

<<<

 to eligible participants in proportion to the amount of each outstanding loan. Excess Cash Flow is based on the annual net increase in cash and cash equivalents less proceeds from certain corporate activities.
· Equity offering: An equity issue

<<<

 in the Company consisting of a private placement with gross proceeds of NOK 300 million and a fully underwritten repair issue of NOK 40 million (the underwriting undertaking is subject to customary conditions including no mandatory bid).
·

<<<

 Waivers: Bondholders will grant the waivers listed in Schedule A of the Restructuring Term Sheet.
For a full overview of the Restructuring, please see the Restructuring Term Sheet which all bondholders are strongly urged to read in its entirety

<<<

. If there is any discrepancy between the terms set out in this summons and the Restructuring Term Sheet, the terms set out in the Restructuring Term Sheet will prevail.
1.3 Bondholder voting - written resolutions
In the Issuer's opinion it

<<<

 would be beneficial to all parties if future resolutions can be implemented faster than under the current bond agreements. By implementing a procedure for written resolutions, the voting procedure will be simplified and the time required to

<<<

 obtain consent to proposed resolutions will be shortened. Consequently the Issuer proposes that a procedure for written resolutions is implemented into all the agreements governing the Bond Issues (the "Bond Agreements"). A procedure for written

<<<

 resolutions is already included in the Bond Trustee's current high yield template loan agreement and the Issuer suggests that the standard clause is implemented in the Bond Agreement with logical adjustments.
2. THE PROPOSAL
Based on the above

<<<

, the Issuer hereby proposes that the Bondholders adopt the following proposal (the "Proposal"):
The Bondholders:
1. approve and authorise the implementation of the Restructuring on the terms of and as described in the Restructuring Term Sheet

<<<

 and the other annexes to this summons;

<<<

<<<

5. waive any breaches of clauses in the Bond Agreements that may have been breached prior to the meeting and/or that are reasonably necessary in order for the Company and any subsidiary to take the required actions to carry out

<<<

1.

<<<

 approvals by the extraordinary general meeting of the Company to issue the shares under the Private Placement, the repair issue and convert Unsecured Bonds to shares has not been obtained on 28 February 2018;

General Information

<<<

: Polarcus Limited (the "Company" or "Polarcus"), an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with registration number 201867, is currently in the process of restructuring its balance sheet as described

<<<

 in the summons for bondholder's meetings with annexes, dated 26 January 2018 (the "Summons") and the restructuring term sheet attached thereto as annex A (the "Restructuring Term Sheet"). As part of the restructuring, the bondholders (the 

<<<

"Bondholders") of the Company's bonds with ISIN (i) NO 001 0757263, (ii) NO 001 0757271, (iii) NO 001 0714389, (iv) NO 001 0757255, (v) NO 001 0680150 and (vi) NO 001 0757248 (the "Existing Unsecured Bonds") are invited to participate in an

<<<

 equity offering in the Company by converting all or parts of their Existing Unsecured Bonds. As described in the Restructuring Term Sheet, the total outstanding principal amount under each tranche for the Existing Unsecured Bonds will be reduced

<<<

 to the applicable call price level for that tranche in 2018 before the conversion takes place.
The Bondholders may subscribe for new shares in the Company (the "New Shares") at a subscription price of NOK 1.3 per share. Bondholders converting

<<<

 Existing Unsecured Bonds denominated in USD, will receive a fixed foreign exchange rate where 1 USD equals NOK 7.81. Upon conversion, Existing Unsecured Bonds will be valued at 70% of par value after the reduction of principal value as set

<<<

 out in the Restructuring Term Sheet.
The amount of Existing Unsecured Bonds that can be converted to New Shares is limited to 50% of the total outstanding amount of Existing Unsecured Bonds (the "Conversion Limit"). If subscriptions for New

<<<

 Shares amount to more than the Conversion Limit, subscribers of New Shares will have their subscriptions reduced pro rata to the subscribed amount. Existing Unsecured Bonds that are not used to subscribe for New Shares will continue to be outstanding

<<<

 on the amended terms set out in the Restructuring Term Sheet.
The New Shares are offered through a private placement (the "Private Placement") directed towards the bondholders of Existing Unsecured Bonds registered with the Norwegian Central

<<<

 Securities Depository ("VPS") at the commencement of the Application Period (as defined below).
The Private Placement is carried out subject to applicable exemptions from relevant prospectus requirements, in the United States in reliance on

<<<

 Rule 144A under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "US Securities Act") (to the extent available) and outside the United States in compliance with Rule 903 or Rule 904, as applicable, of Regulation S under the US Securities

<<<

 Act, and the exemptions available under the EU Prospectus Directive as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area ("EEA").
Polarcus has appointed ABG Sundal Collier ASA as manager (the "Manager") in the Private Placement.

<<<

 for New Shares will be governed by the terms and conditions set out in this application agreement (the "Application Agreement") and the Summons (together with the Application Agreement, the "Investor Documentation"). The undersigned (the "Applicant

<<<

 will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer, and that the New Shares are offered under available exemptions including Regulation S and Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (where

<<<

 applicable).
The Company agrees that for as long as any of the New Shares being offered and sold pursuant to the Private Placement remain outstanding and are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities

<<<

 Act, if at any time the Company is neither subject to Section 13 or Section 15(d) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "U.S. Exchange Act"), nor exempt from reporting under the U.S. Exchange Act pursuant to Rule

<<<

 U.S. Securities Act, upon the written request of any such shareholder.
Canada: The distribution of the New Shares in Canada is being made only on a private-placement basis, thus exempting it from the requirement that the Company prepare and

<<<

 file a prospectus with the applicable securities regulatory authorities. The New Shares are being offered in those jurisdictions and to those persons where and to whom they may lawfully be offered for sale, and therein only by persons permitted

<<<

 to sell such securities. Each Canadian purchaser who purchases New Shares must be entitled under applicable securities laws to purchase such securities without the benefit of a prospectus qualified under such securities laws; must be an "accredited
