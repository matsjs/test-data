Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA is appointed loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN N0001035651.2 (the "Loan") where American Shipping Company ASA (the "Borrower") is the issuer. (Prior to 21 July 2008 the registered name of the Borrower was Aker

<<<

 American Shipping ASA).

According to the Borrower, it has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the fluctuation of interest rate movements on its debt service. These interest rate

<<<

 swap instruments, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), are marked-to-market as of the last day of each reporting period. Consequently, any resulting gains or losses from the change in fair market value of the

<<<

 hedge are non cash and unrealized and are recorded on the books and records of the Borrower through the income statement. Thus, the balance sheet impact is either an increase or decrease in equity. As of December 31, 2008, the mark-to-market

<<<

 valuation of those interest rate swap instruments was approximately USD 101 million in favour of the swap counterparty, of which approximately USD 58 million will be attributable to the fourth quarter income statement. As a result of the IFRS

<<<

 requirement, the consolidated group equity may be reduced below the minimum requirement of USD 140 million.
The interest rate swaps have been entered into to fix the interest rates under a USD 770 million loan facility in order to protect stakeholders

<<<

 against interest rate fluctuations. It was however not foreseen that the unprecedented volatility in the USD credit market would result in significant non-cash, unrealised losses related to these interest rate swaps, particularly when such

<<<

 interest rate swaps have been entered into to protect investors against negative interest rate fluctuations.
(2) Extension o fPayment-in-Kindperiod
Pursuant to Clause 9.5 ther Borrower may:
"at its sole discretion make any o f the interest

<<<

 payments for the first twelve (12) quarterly interest period (i.e. the first three (3) years payment o f interest) as additional Bonds (based on the NOK 1 face value o f the Bonds), calculated based on the total number o f Bonds at each Interest

<<<

 Payment Date, rounded down to the nearest NOK ( "Payment-in-Kind"). "
Due to current global financial market conditions, the Borrower wishes to extend the period for the Payment-in-Kind until the Maturity Date. The Borrower desires to build

<<<

 additional vessels (via its options with Aker Philadelphia Shipyard) to take advantage of anticipated opportunities in the Jones Act Market, the borrower is taking all steps to improve liquidity. By extending the PIK period until the Maturity

<<<

 Date, the Borrower will be in an enhanced position to capitalize on these opportunities. Future growth opportunities are dependent upon the availability of capital, and the Borrower believes that this change will foster an improved cash position

<<<

 to the benefit of all of its stakeholders.
The Proposal
The Borrower proposes:
(1) that it shall be permitted on a permanent basis, when computing Equity for the purpose of calculation in Clause 13.2 (a), to disregard any non-cash gain or


<<<

2

· N O R SK TIL L IT SM A N N ASA

loss in the market value of any interest rate swaps in order for the accounts to reflect actual cash disbursements for interest hedging purposes. The change of the Equity calculation will furthermore allow

<<<

 the Borrower to disregard unforeseen non-cash adjustments to Equity resulting from market changes and thereby also provide a more accurate Equity position including the maintenance of the USD 140 million equity covenant. An approval will avoid

<<<

 a possible technical breach under the Loan Agreement, which (according to the Borrower) might affect relationships between the Borrower and others who do not otherwise consider these unrealized, non-cash gains and losses as material to the

<<<

 financial condition of the Borrower. In the opinion of the Borrower, avoiding these unintended consequences will benefit the Borrower and therefore ultimately benefit the Bondholders.
(2) that the Payment-in-Kind period is extended until the

<<<

 Maturity Date. An approval will potentially extend the period of non-cash payment of interest until the Maturity Date which, if utilized by the Borrower, will increase the credit to the Borrower and the risk related to it. However, the non

<<<

-cash payment will according to the Borrower benefit the Borrower's overall liquidity position.
According to the Loan Agreement, the proposed consents requires approval from die Bondholders. Such approvals ought to be given if the Bondholders

<<<

 find the overall risk assessment and risk compensation (if any) to be fair.
The Loan Trustee notes that the Borrower requests a consent from the Bondholders which relaxes the requirements to the financial position of the Borrower. The proposed

<<<

 extension of the Payment-in-Kind period seems to increase the risk for the Bondholders. The proposal is made without offering any compensation to the Bondholders for the proposed changes. The request is put forward to the Bondholders without

<<<

 further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

Bondholders' meeting:

Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' meeting:

It is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting resolve the following:
(1) The Bondholders approve thatfor the purpose o f computing

<<<

 Equity in respect o f Clause 13.2 (a), the Borrower shall disregard from such computation, the effect o f any non-cash gain or loss from the change in fair market value o f any interest rate hedging arrangements entered into and maintained

<<<

 by the Borrower, or any consolidated subsidiary, from time to time.
(2) The Bondholders approve that the Borrower at its sole discretion make any o f the interest payments until the Maturity Date as additional Bonds (Payment-in-Kind).
The above

<<<

 mentioned resolution will, according to the Loan Agreement, require a majority of 2/3 of the bonds represented at the bondholders' meeting voting in favour and a minimum 5/10 of the outstanding bonds being represented at the meeting. Bondholders

<<<

 may be represented in person or by proxy.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and

<<<

 of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e, the owner is not registered directly in the VPS the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds

<<<

 and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's

<<<

 Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the

<<<

 event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as

<<<

 sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or

<<<

 by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
