Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" /the "Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders o f bonds (the "Bondholders") in the following loans: the NOK 400 million "FRN Bergen Yards Holding

<<<

 AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2008" with ISIN NO 001039550.2 (the "NOK 400 million Loan") and the NOK 250 million "FRN Bergen Yards Holding AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010" with ISIN NO 001037936.5 (the "NOK 25

2. BACKGROUND FOR THE PROPOSAL
To summarize, the Company informs that the reason for the Proposal is threefold:
Firstly, the Company has over some time worked with a number of banks with the objective to refinance existing debt

<<<

. However, due to the current difficult financial markets the Company has been unable to secure a refinancing in the bank market o f its NOK 400 million Loan within the timeframe as initially planned, and consequently need to ask the Bondholders

<<<

 in the NOK 400 million Loan to extend the final maturity date o f the Company's outstanding Bond Loans.
Secondly, the increased activity in Bergen Group will result in a gradually increase in total assets whilst the construction o f the different

<<<

 projects are in progress. According to the Company's estimates, it may be challenging to comply with the existing Equity Ratio level. Consequently the Company needs to ask the Bondholders to accept to reset the Equity Ratio at a lower level

<<<

.
Thirdly, in order for the Company to secure bank financing of the Ilanoytangen extension, the new lenders have required pledge over all of the Company's shares in Hanoytangen AS and Bergen Group Hanoytangen AS which are currently covered by

<<<

 the negative pledge provision in the Loan Agreement related to the NOK 250 million Loan.
As a consequence, there will be proposed changes to each separate Loan as well as changes related to both Loans combined. In addition, the Bondholders

<<<

 will be given the option to choose between a Warrant Structure or an Increased Redemption Price.
Please see the Company Update for information regarding the background for the Proposal, as well at the operational and financial status of the

<<<

 Company.
For further information about the Company, please refer to the web site www.bergengroup.no.
3. THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE BOND LOAN AGREEMENTS (THE "PROPOSAL")
3.1 Summary o f the Proposal
The Company is proposing amendments to the

<<<

 Loan Agreements as described in detail further below. The proposed amendments can be summarized as follows:
- the Equity Ratio covenant in the Loan Agreements to be reduced to 30 % - the current Dividend covenant in the Loan Agreements to be

<<<

 amended to establish a
no dividend covenant to block dividend payments throughout the tenor o f the Loans increased margin for the Loans
2

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA www.lriistce.iio

- new amortization schedules for the Loans; hereunder

<<<

 the final maturity date for the NOK 400 million Loan will be extended to 13 August 2010, the same date as the final maturity date for the NOK 250 million Loan
- the bondholders in each o f the Loan will be given the opportunity to choose between

<<<

 a warrants structure or increased redemption price at final maturity for the NOK 250 million Loan the amendments will also include a removal o f the negative pledge restriction related to the Company's shares in Hanoytangcn AS and Bergen Group

<<<

 Hanoytangcn AS, and the establishment of a new sharepledge over all o f the Company's shares in Bergen Group SiJo AS, Bergen Group Vest Elektro AS and Bergen Group BSM AS which will be in addition to the existing security package.

<<<

 Proposal

<<<

 3.2.3 below, the Bondholders in each o f the Loans will be given the option to choose between a warrants structure and an increased redemption price at final maturity as described in this section 3.2.1.

The increased redemption price at final

<<<

 maturity will be decided upon in the Bondholder's meeting and represent the fallback solution for any Bondholder that does not opt for alternative A (the Warrant Structure) (the "Exchange Offer") in each o f the two Loans by signing and filling

<<<

 out the Acceptance Form related to the Exchange Offer enclosed to this summons letter and return it to Pareto within the expiry date of the Exchange Offer.

To facilitate the aforesaid, each existing Loan will be split in two separate tranches

<<<

. Both tranches are being equal and pari passu with the exception of necessary adjustments related to the inclusion of the warrant structure and increased redemption price at final maturity respectively.

The Bondholders who choose alternative

<<<

 A (the Warrant Structure) will be transferred to a tranche with a new ISIN. The other Bondholders will remain in the current tranche of the relevant Loan with the Increased Redemption Price.

Further, the Proposal is subject

<<<

 to that the Exchange Offer is carried out and that the allocation o f Warrants is made within 31 July 2009 at the latest.
Furthermore, the issue o f the warrants is subject to a resolution by the Company's extraordinary general meeting to be

<<<

 held on or about 30 June 2009.
4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
4.1 Bergen Group's evaluation o f the Proposal
Based on its current financial situation, Bergen Group is of the opinion that the by the offering to the Bondholders of the

<<<

 Warrant Structure or the Increased Redemption Price, increased margins, amortizations and additional share pledge, the Bondholders are offered a fair and balanced solution and that the proposed amendments are beneficial to the Bondholders.

<<<


Bergen Group is experiencing a substantial increased activity within all business areas which in the Company's view must be viewed positively by all stakeholders. Increased EBITDA generation will enhance Bergen Group's ability to service its

<<<

 financial obligations going forward, including the refinancing of the Loans in 2010.
Furthermore, securing full financing o f the Hanoytangen development is important for the Company in order to meet its contractual obligations related to the

<<<

 Transocean contract and to make Hanoytangen a full fledge offshore service base. The contract itself is a major contract for the further development o f Bergen Group's Offshore business and is expected to be a major EBIDTA contributor in the

<<<

 coming years.
By financing the Ilanoytangen project as described, the Company will free up substantial cash already invested in the project and thereby strengthen the liquidity situation in the Company. Furthermore, to finance the Hanoytangen

<<<

 extension will be a
7

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
W W W .ti'USl'CC.iH)
major achievement by the Company, and a strong evidence and acceptance by the financial markets o f the Company's strategy going forward.
The Company has engaged Pareto

<<<

 Securities AS (the "Pareto") as its financial advisor with respect to the Proposal. Bondholders may accordingly contact Pareto Securities Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70 for further information.
Pareto is acting solely as advisor for

<<<

 the Company and no-one else in connection with the Proposal. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by Pareto with respect to the Company and Pareto expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the

<<<

 Proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein and in the Company Update).
4.2 The Trustee's evaluation o f the Proposal
Taken into account today's challenging debt and equity markets, asking for an extension o f the

<<<

 final maturity date o f the Company's existing debt is an option instead o f a refinancing o f the existing debt. Further, the Company needs an adjustment o f the Equity Ratio to a lower level due to the construction of different projects being

<<<

 in process. Furthermore, the investments, developments and an upgrade of the facilities at Hanoytangen will facilitate increased activity.
For the NOK 400 Loan, the question is whether the Bondholders are offered a fair and balanced compensation

<<<

 for the consent to the establishment of an extension and the new Equity Ratio. The Bondholders must themselves evaluate whether the increased margin and the choice between the warrants and the increased Redemption Price is a fair compensation

<<<

.
For the NOK 250 Loan, the question is whether the Bondholders are offered a fair and balanced compensation for the consent to the removal o f the negative pledge related to the shares in Hanoytangen AS and Bergen Group Hanoytangen AS and the

<<<

 new Equity Ratio. The Bondholders must themselves evaluate whether the value of the new share pledges, the increased margin, new amortization schedules and the choice between warrants and the increased Redemption Price is a fair compensation

<<<

.
The Trustee is o f the opinion that the Proposal is based on the most obvious solution for the Company taken into consideration that it reflects that the Company is in a position where it has to adapt to the challenging debt and equity markets

<<<

. As long as the Bondholders are asked to adjust their terms and conditions, it is fair to establish a no dividend covenant.
It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with their own advisors to evaluate the consequences of the Proposal

<<<

 and with tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences of the Proposal. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has challenges going forward.

 Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010
2 June 2009
1. Introduction
This Company update has been prepared in connection with the upcoming bondholders' meeting in the loan agreements (the "Loan Agreements") where Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" / the "Trustee

<<<

") acts as trustee for the holders o f bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above-mentioned loans; the NOK 400 million FRN Bergen Yards Holding AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2008 with ISIN NO 001039550.2 (the "NOK 400 million Loan"

<<<

) and the NOK 250 million FRN Bergen Yards Holding AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010 with ISIN NO 001037936.5 (the "NOK 250 million Loan"), (together the "Loans" or the "Bond Issues"), and where Bergen Group ASA (previously Bergen

<<<

 Yards Holding AS) ("Bergen Group" or the "Company") is the borrower.
All capitalized terms shall have the same meaning as assigned to them in the Loan Agreements.
In addition to this Company Update, Norsk Tillitsmann has prepared a separate

<<<

 summons letter (the "Summons Letter"). Bondholders are encouraged to read both documents in addition to the Loan Agreement, available with the trustee NT at + 47 22 87 94 00.
2. Background for the Bondholders' Meeting
The Company is proposing

<<<

 certain amendments to the Loan Agreements. The proposed amendments are supported by the largest bondholders in each of the two bond loans. The reasons for the proposed amendments are as follows:
· The Company has for some considerable time

<<<

 investigated different refinancing alternatives for its two outstanding bond loans. Due to the current financial crisis, the management o f Bergen Group believes it is challenging to secure a refinancing o f the Loans in the bank market as

<<<

 initially planned. Consequently, Bergen Group needs to request the bondholders in the NOK 400 million Loan to extend the final maturity date by 13 months from 6 July 2009 to 13 August 2010.
1

Bergen Group ASA - Company Update
· The Company

<<<

 has experienced a strong growth in its order backlog. From the end o f 2007 to IQ 2009 the order backlog has increased from NOK 5.7 billion to NOK 6.3 billion. The strong increase is a result o f an overall increased activity within all business

<<<

 areas but foremost a sharp increase in the order backlog o f the shipbuilding business as a consequence o f the acquisition of Fosen Holding AS.
The increased activity of Bergen Group will result in a gradually increase in total assets of Bergen

<<<

 Group whilst the construction of the different projects are in progress and according to the Company's estimate may make it challenging to comply with the existing Equity Ratio level o f 35%. Consequently the Company needs to ask the bondholders

<<<

 to accept to reset the Equity Ratio at a lower level.
· Furthermore as a consequence of increased activity within the Offshore business area and in particular in relation to the Transocean contract as described in more detail below, Bergen

<<<

 Group has commenced the development and investments in the facilities at Hanoytangen. The total project cost is estimated to be NOK 150 million. The main elements o f the project are new deep-water berth, housing quarters, and extension of

<<<

 land areas. The work is expected to be finalized during 2Q 2009 resulting in a strategically located and state of the art facility for offshore maintenance work. As per today, the Company has invested approximately NOK 100 million at Hanoytangen

<<<

 in order to make Hanoytangen a full fledge offshore service base to meet the strong requirements for Transocean and other rig operators.
The investment at Hanoytangen is expected to be financed through a combination o f bank debt and leasing

<<<

 arrangements. The leasing financing has already been committed by SR Finans. Bergen Group is currently working towards a final commitment for the long term financing of the project. However, in order to finalize this financing, the Company

<<<

 needs to make a specific amendment to the Loan Agreement for the NOK 250 million Loan.
In particular the bondholders will be requested to accept that the new lenders are granted pledge in all o f the Company's shares in Hanoytangen AS (50%

<<<

) and Bergen Group Hanoytangen AS (100%). The Company is currently unable to pledge these shares due to a negative pledge provision in the current Loan Agreement.

Bergen Group Hanoytangen AS, a subsidiary o f Bergen Group Offshore AS, entered into an agreement with Transocean Offshore (North Sea) Ltd NUF ("Transocean") in October 2008 for the

<<<

 upgrading of 3 offshore rigs. The framework agreement with Transocean has an estimated aggregated contract value o f NOK 500 million. Based on the original calculations for this contract and the experience so far into the project, Bergen Group

<<<

 is expecting this contract to give an attractive contribution to the Company's financial result for 2009.

The contract with Transocean is a break-through for the Company's strong ambition as to becoming a leading supplier of services for the

<<<

 offshore industry, in particularly within modification and maintenance of rigs. Hanoytangen is strategically located close to the units operating in the North Sea, and the facility is a strong competitive advantage to other potential yards

<<<

.

Bergen Group has completed a thorough mapping o f the offshore activity in the North Sea. The key findings show that there are approximately 75 units (semi-submersible and jack-ups) which most are on long-term contracts with solid counterparties

<<<

, and the majority o f this fleet has a high average age. The rig-service activity is expected to be strong over the next 3-5 years due to required classifications, a high number o f rigs entering on new contracts, as well as new rigs are arriving

<<<

 the North Sea in relation to contract start ups. All o f these are expecting to have minor or major stays at yards nearby their fields o f operation. Bergen Group is expecting more than 20 rigs to enter Norwegian yards per year over the next

 5 years.

Bergen Group had an operating profit before depreciation and write-downs (EBITDA) of NOK 78 million for the first quarter

<<<

 o f 2009, up from NOK 37 million in the first quarter of 2008. Operating revenues were NOK 1,146 million, compared with NOK 704 million in the same period last year. Shipbuilding and Offshore in particular delivered good results in this quarter

<<<

. Revenues and profit for Offshore were affected by the late arrival o f a rig at Hanpytangen, while other units within the segment delivered as expected. The order backlog as at 31 March was NOK 6.3 billion.
The improvement in profit in the

<<<

 group reflects better project management, coordination and control. The group is becoming more professional, and synergies are increasingly making a positive contribution.
Bergen Group Fosen entered into new contracts during April 2009 with

<<<

 BOA Offshore for outfitting four multifunctional platform supply vessels (PSVs) of VS495 design and an MT6007 PSV. The total contract value is NOK 2,739 million. All the contracts are conditional on financing and board approvals. The global

<<<

 turbulence in financial markets still causes general uncertainty concerning market growth and opportunities for financing projects. The group management has a strong focus on tackling today's challenges, but is simultaneously conscious that

<<<

 this must not affect the market orientation and follow-up of customers and projects.
Bergen Group is working actively to refinance part of its bond debt which matures in July, and expects this to be resolved before maturity.
Expectations of

<<<

 approximately NOK 5 billion in revenues for 2009 and that the EBITDA margin will improve, as compared with 2008, are being maintained.
Financial review
This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 on interim financial reporting

Bergen Group ASA / Interim report first quarter 2009

Order backlog The order backlog as at 31 March 2009 was NOK 6.3 billion, compared with NOK 5 billion

 a year earlier and NOK 6.8 billion as at 31 December 2008. In addition come shipbuilding contracts worth NOK 2.8 billion secured after 31 March, which are conditional on board approvals and financing.
The group had an order intake of NOK 5

<<<

88 million in the quarter. Although the market was affected by the financial crisis, new projects are being pursued by all the business areas.
Income statement The group's operating revenues were NOK 1,146 million, compared with NOK 704 million

<<<

 in the same period of 2008. Operating profit before depreciation (EBITDA) amounted to NOK 78 million, compared with NOK 37 million in the first quarter of 2008. This yielded an EBITDA margin of 6.8 per cent, compared with 5.2 per cent for the

<<<

 same quarter of last year. The EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 4.0 per cent.
After depreciation totalling NOK 22 million, including NOK 11 million in excess depreciation, operating profit after depreciation and write-downs

<<<

 (EBIT) was NOK 56 million, compared with NOK 21 million for the same quarter of last year.
Net financial expenses amounted to NOK 7 million, compared with NOK 19 million for the first quarter of 2008.
Profit before taxes amounted to NOK 48

<<<

 million, compared with NOK 1 million for the same period of last year.
The margin improvement for the group in the first quarter related particularly to Shipbuilding and Technology, which achieved an EBITDA margin of 5.7 and 11.7 per cent respectively

<<<

. Offshore's revenues were down during the period due to delayed start-up of a project related to Bergen Group Hanoytangen. This also reduced the operating margin compared with earlier quarters. Preparatory activities at Hanoytangen proceeded

<<<

 as planned during the period. Maritime Service experienced only minor changes.
Balance sheet and cash flow The group's total assets amounted to NOK 4,143 million as at 31 March, compared with NOK 3,177 million a year earlier. Goodwill and


<<<

excess value totalled NOK 1,374 million, and are mainly associated with acquisitions in 2007 and 2008. Group receivables were NOK 466 million, while cash and cash equivalents came to NOK 277 million. Consolidated equity totalled NOK 1,4

<<<

53 million, giving an equity ratio of 35.1 per cent. The group had current liabilities of NOK 2,071 million, including the outstanding bond loan of NOK 361.5 million which matures in July 2009. Long-term liabilities were NOK 618 million as at

 31 March.
Net cash flow for the group in the first quarter was NOK 27 million. Cash flow from operational activities totalled NOK 60 million. Cash flow from investment activities was negative at NOK 29 million, primarily reflecting preparations

The EBITDA margin for Shipbuilding was 5.7 per cent (EBITDA NOK 38 million), compared with 2.7 per cent (EBITDA NOK 10 million) in the same period of 2008.

Shipbuilding had a total order backlog of NOK 5.3 billion as at 31 March, compared

Bergen Group BMV and Bergen Group Fosen have good order coverage for 2009, 2010 and to some extent 2011. Most of the group's major projects are financed on a continuous basis by customers at contractual milestones

. Some shipbuilding is financed by construction loans, and funding is in place for these through established bank partners.

After 31 March, the group also announced cut backs in activity at Landskrona because of a shortage of newbuildings.

 Other activities are also being assessed for Bergen Group Halsnøy, where no newbuilding work is currently available to start when BN 123 has been completed this summer.

EBITDA was NOK 10 million, compared with NOK 15 million for the first quarter of 2008. The EBITDA margin was 4.2 per cent, compared with 7.3 per cent for the same period of
