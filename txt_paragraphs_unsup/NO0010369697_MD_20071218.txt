 Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 with Warrants - Waiver
Oslo, 18 December 2007
Information to the Bondholders
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where Biofuel

<<<

 Energy AS (the "Issuer") is the issuer. Destilaria Paranapanema SA (the "Project Company") is a sub subsidiary of the Issuer.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement unless otherwise stated

<<<

.
In accordance with the Loan Agreement for the Bond Issue, clause 16.2 k) the Project Company may not, unless the Loan Trustee or the Bondholders' acting pursuant to a meeting (as the case may be) in writing has agreed to otherwise, incur any

<<<

 new indebtedness or financial obligations (including, but not limited to, capitalized leases).
The bondholders are hereby informed that the Loan Trustee has granted the Issuer a waiver which enables the Project Company to enter into a capitalized

<<<

 lease for the financing of 32 trucks. The trucks shall be used by the Project Company primarily for the transportation of sugar cane from the agricultural fields to the sugar cane distillery.
The waiver is granted on the basis of an evaluation

<<<

 of the financing alternatives for acquiring the trucks, where the least attractive alternative is an operational lease (which do not require consent from the bondholders or the Loan Trustee), and the best available alternative is a financial

<<<

 lease. Thus, the economic interest of all stakeholders (including the bondholders in the Bond Issue) is better served by the Project Company entering into a financial lease rather than an operational lease.
Yours sincerely NORSK TILLITSMANN
