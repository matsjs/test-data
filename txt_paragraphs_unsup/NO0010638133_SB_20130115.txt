INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1.1

Introduction

As the Issuer has previously announced, most recently in its interim report for the third quarter of 2012, the Issuer has significant contingent claims outstanding

<<<

 related to two separate issues which are or were in dispute:

(i)

claims against Boskalis related to the charter of the vessel MV Finnmarken; and

(ii)

claims against the Norwegian Government, which has withheld money due to the

investigation

<<<

 initiated by the EFTA Surveillance Agency ("ESA") regarding the

Supplementary Agreement between the company and the Norwegian Government entered

into in 2008 for the period from 2007 to 2011.

1.2

Arbitration case related to the charter

<<<

 of MV Finnmarken in Australia

The Issuer's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty Ltd., filed an arbitration case against the contracting party, Boskalis, for outstanding claims in connection with the charter of the MV Finnmarken. The outstanding

<<<

 claim amounted to NOK 370 million. Due to the principle of prudence, Hurtigruten made provisions in the total amount NOK 46 million per 31 December 2011. The provisions have been accounted for as provisions for bad debts under other operating

<<<

 costs.

The arbitration was initiated as a result of Hurtigruten not being able to establish contact directly with Boskalis to solve the issue. In the course of the arbitration process, Boskalis invited Hurtigruten to participate in mediation

<<<

. The mediation took place in Perth, Australia, and resulted in an offer from

Boskalis to pay AUD 38 million (approximately NOK 221 million). The offer included a requirement that all claims from Hurtigruten towards Boskalis were to be waived and that all claims from Boskalis towards Hurtigruten were to be similarly

<<<

 waived.

As the Issuer reported in a stock exchange notice to the Oslo Stock Exchange on 21 December 2012, the parties have entered into a settlement agreement which resolved all the issues in dispute between the parties. Pursuant to the terms

<<<

 of the settlement agreement, Boskalis has paid the settlement amount of AUD 38 million (approximately NOK 221 million) to the Issuer.

The settlement gives the Issuer a positive cash flow effect of approximately NOK 221 million and an accounting

<<<

 loss o f approximately NOK 99 million. The loss will be accounted as other operating costs.

1.3

The ESA case

In 2004, the Norwegian Government entered into a contract with the Issuer for the delivery of transport services along the Norwegian

<<<

 coast from Bergen to Kirkenes for the period from 2005 to 2012. This contract was awarded based on a competitive tendering process. In October 2008, it was decided to increase the compensation to the Issuer for the remaining term of the contract

<<<

 by refunding 90% of the NOx payments, general compensation due to higher costs and allowing a reduction in the number of ships from 11 to 10 in the winter for the remaining term o f the contract. The Ministry of Transport and Communications

<<<

 assumed that the additional grant was in line with applicable state aid policies.

In July 2010, ESA decided to formally launch an investigation in order to verify whether the supplementary agreement entered into in 2008 was in accordance with

<<<

 the European Economic Area ("EEA") agreement's rules for state aid. In June 2011, ESA concluded that the additional compensation had not been granted in accordance with the EEA agreement's rules. It was not evident from the conclusion what

<<<

 portion of the supplementary agreement ESA believed to represent illegal state aid.

In a decision of 29 June 2011, ESA concluded that the supplementary compensation was in violation of the EEA agreement's rules governing state aid. In the

<<<

 process leading up to the judgement, ESA prepared its own decision in June 2012, and determined that an estimated NOK 145 million constituted unlawful aid. The Norwegian Government stopped making payments in the summer of 2010, and NOK 235

<<<

 million remained payable to the Issuer under the contract. The undisputed amount o f NOK 90 million, less interest costs, was then received by the Issuer on 17 December 2012.

At 30 September 2012, the Issuer had recognized income of NOK 4

<<<

05 million under the supplementary agreement, and had received NOK 170 million of this amount. Due to the principle of prudence, a provision totalling NOK 108 million has been made with respect to the supplementary agreement in the third quarter

<<<

 o f 2012, in addition to the NOK 35 million provision made on 31 December 2011. The provisions have been accounted for as a reduction in the contractual revenue.

The fact that ESA's decision has been upheld does not necessarily imply that

<<<

 the ESA's assessment of how much of the outstanding amount can be paid to the Issuer is final. This is a separate issue that will have to be resolved between the Norwegian Government and the Issuer, and which may be brought before a Norwegian

<<<

 court.

1.4

Request for waiver

Pursuant to Clause 13.5(b) (Financial covenants) no. 2 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer shall procure that the leverage ratio, defines as the ratio of Interest Bearing Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, from and

<<<

 including 31 December 2012 shall be lower than 6.5x, where Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured over a 12 months period ending on the last day of each financial year. From and including 31 December 2013, such ratio shall be reduced by 0.5x

<<<

 each year.

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

The losses incurred in the Boskalis case and the provisions made in the ESA case represent nonrecurring items, which means that they are not related to normal operations but rather

<<<

 extraordinary incidents. Although the resolution of these issues in aggregate have given a positive cash flow effect of approximately NOK 315 million, the provisions made and the losses incurred will have an adverse effect on the Consolidated

<<<

 EBITDA in the financial year ending on 31 December 2012.

In order to avoid a breach of the maximum leverage covenant, the Issuer requests the Bondholders' Meeting to agree to increase the leverage ratio from 6.5x to 12.5x for the Measurement

<<<

 Period ending on 31 December 2012.

As compensation for such waiver, the Issuer offers a waiver fee to the Bondholders upon approval in the Bondholders' Meetings, as further set out in section 3 below.

The Issuer's bank syndicate has already

<<<

 granted the waivers required to avoid any breach of the Issuer's financial covenants under its senior secured financing agreements.

PROPOSAL

2.1

Request for temporary waiver

In accordance with Clause 16.2 o f the Bond Agreement, the

<<<

 Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting for the Bond Issue in order to consider the Issuer's request for a temporary waiver of the leverage ratio covenant.

The Issuer makes the following proposal (the "Proposal

<<<

"):

Themaximum leverage ratio set out in paragraph (b) no. 2 o f Clause 13.5 o f the Bond Agreement shall be increasedfrom 6.5x to 12.5x fo r the Measurement Period ending on 31 December 2012. From and including the Measurement Period ending

<<<

 on 31 December 2013, the maximum leverage ratio shall be applied in accordance with the terms o f the Bond Agreement.

2.2 Waiver fee

As a compensation to the Bondholders for approving the Proposal, the Issuer offers the Bondholders a one

<<<

-time waiver fee of 0.25% (flat) of the face value of the Bonds, payable to the Bondholders (with record date on the end of business on the date of the Bondholders' Meeting) within ten (10) Business Days after the Bondholders' Meetings, provided

<<<

 that the Bondholders' Meeting accepts the Proposal set out in section 2 of this summons letter.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

3.1 The Issuer's evaluation
The breach of the maximum leverage ratio covenant is of a temporary nature caused by

<<<

 the nonrecurring items incurred in the third and fourth quarter of 2012. The resolution of the issues in dispute will have a cash-positive effect to the Issuer, and will thus contribute to strengthening the Issuer's debt servicing capacity

<<<

. The Issuer expects to be fully compliant with the financial covenants in the Bond Agreement from and including the Measurement Period ending on 31 December 2013.

In the Issuer's opinion, the waiver fee offered to the Bondholders as compensation

<<<

 for the amendments represents a fair and balanced proposal, considering the background for the waiver request and the temporary nature o f the waiver.
