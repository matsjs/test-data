2 THE RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
2.1 The proposed restructuring of the Loans
The holders in the

<<<

 Warrant Bond and the Unsecured Bond are asked to accept a mandatory exchange o f their Bonds into new bonds (the "New Bond"). The Warrant Bond will be exchanged into a USD tranche in the ratio o f 1:1 o f par principal value1, while the Unsecured

<<<

 Bond will be exchanged into aN O K tranche in the ratio of 1:1 of par principal value1. This way all Bondholders will keep their current currency position. Both the USD and NOK tranches of the New Bond will have the same terms and rank pari

<<<

 passu. All accrued and unpaid interest on the Warrant Bond and the Unsecured Bond, whether due and payable or not, will be settled in the form of bonds in the New Bond on a USD 1:1 and NOK 1:1 ratio respectively. The part of the New Bond to

<<<

 be received initially by the Interoil Principals currently holding a part in the Warrant Bond (approximate principal amount of USD 9 million) will be converted to equity in the Borrower immediately after issue of the New Bond.
The New Bond

<<<

 will have a tenor o f 5 years and carry a coupon o f 15.0% (payable quarterly). The Issuer may redeem part of the New Bond or all o f the New Bond at any time at 100% o f par value plus accrued interest. The New Bond will be repaid from cash

<<<

 received from its operating subsidiaries through a cash sweep mechanism, where any remaining principal amount outstanding will be repaid at maturity date at the latest. There will be a retention account, pledged in favor of the Bondholders

<<<

 where 3 months of interest shall be deposited at all times. As opposed to the current structures, the New Bond will have a partially secured claim in the Borrower, where the security package mainly consists of a first priority pledge on the

<<<

 cash sweep account, share pledges in relevant subsidiaries and on demand guarantees from subsidiaries other than InterOil Peru S.A. and InterOil Colombia Exploration and Production Inc. (which subsidiaries' shares will be pledged in favour

<<<

 of the senior secured facility lender and which subsidiaries' are currently prohibited from providing such guarantees). Without prior approval of the Bondholders, no dividends will be allowed to be distributed to the shareholders of the Borrower

<<<

 before the New Bond is repaid entirely.
The New Bond will be issued under Norwegian law with Norsk Tillitsmann as Trustee.
Please see the Term Sheet enclosed to this summons as Exhibit 3 for further information on the terms and conditions of

<<<

 the New Bond.
1For the avoidance o f doubt, this implies that one Warrant Bond with a par principal value o f USD 1,000 will be exchanged into thousand New Bonds with a par principal value o f USD 1, and that one Unsecured Bond with a par principal

<<<

 value o f NOK 500,000 will be exchanged into five hundred thousand New Bonds with a par principal value o f NOK 1.

2.2 Tax Repayment
On 25 July 2008, the Borrower entered a settlement agreement with

<<<

 Exportconsult AS and Force Capital Partners AS with respect to the Borrower assuming responsibility for payment o f a tax claim against said parties in the amount o f NOK 57.15 million following transfer to the Issuer of shares in the Issuer

<<<

's Swiss subsidiary. The settlement agreement was amended on 11 March 2010, following which the timing of the payment obligation o f the Borrower was clarified, as well as a specific confirmation that the Borrower's payment obligation with respect

<<<

 to said tax claims would be subordinated to the existing secured bonds as well as the Warrant Bond and the Unsecured Bond.
The settlement agreement and the amendment were both resolved by the General Meeting o f the Borrower.
Exportconsult

<<<

 AS and Force Capital Partners AS have initiated court proceedings against the Norwegian Tax Authorities to reverse the decision of the tax liability. If the appeal is successful, Exportconsult AS and Force Capital Partners AS have assigned

<<<

 to the Borrower any amount received by it from the Norwegian Tax Authorities or from any other applicable taxation authorities (the "Tax Repayment"), o f which such Tax Repayment shall be paid to the Borrower.
The refinancing proposal presented

<<<

 by the Borrower in this summons and the attached Term Sheet (the "Proposal") includes a payment to the aforementioned shareholders in order to settle the relevant tax liabilities assumed by the Borrower (in 2008) at a time prior to settlement

<<<

 of the Bonds. This deviates from the current arrangement, however is a condition to achieving the total refinancing solution and is thus proposed for acceptance by the holders of the Warrant Bond and the Unsecured Bond.
2.3 Conditions and timetable

<<<


The proposed changes to the Unsecured Bond and the Warrant Bond will be subject to inter alia:
(i) All required approvals by the requisite majority of Bondholders of each of the Warrant Bond and the Unsecured Bond
(ii) Exchange and extinguishment

<<<

 o f the Warrant Bond and the Unsecured Bond (iii) Drawdown of the USD 60m term loan facility in Peru and USD 30m term
loan facility in Columbia (iv) West Face (Norway) AS and/or a related party o f West Face (Norway) AS
("West Face") to subscribe

<<<

 for USD 40m in the New Bond at equal terms (v) The Voluntary Offer from West Face (Norway) AS dated 2 July 2010 has
been completed, following satisfaction (or waiver) of all conditions related thereto.
The approval o f the Bondholders will

<<<

 also be subject to all conditions precedent having been met on or before 30 August 2010.

3 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
3.1 The Borrower's evaluation
As part o f the offer for the Borrower's shares

<<<

 and full refinancing o f the Borrower, the unsecured Bondholders are asked to exchange their bonds into the New Bond. The issuance of the New Bond secures the Borrower a long-term financing solution together with the new term loan facilities

<<<

, new equity and the partial equity conversion o f the Warrant Bond. Today's unsecured Bondholders will move to a partially secured claim in the Borrower, where the clear intention is to repay the New Bond as soon as possible from the operating

<<<

 cash flow, any increased debt capacity under the bank facility given license extension in Peru, increased proved reserves in Colombia and any cash proceeds from potential West African asset sales or the reimbursement of the Tax Repayment amounts

<<<

 described above in the event of a successful tax appeal.
By accepting the Proposal, the Borrower will be capitalized with approx. USD 19 million of new equity in addition to longer-term bank financing - West Face will invest USD 10 million

<<<

 in equity and the Interoil Principals will convert debt to equity of USD 9 million. In addition, West Face will be investing USD 40 million in the New Bond at equal terms which is their largest exposure in the Borrower.
The Borrower has since

<<<

 May 2009 worked hard to find a satisfactory solution for its stakeholders. As of today, this offer is the only feasible alternative versus a potential bankruptcy proceeding or enforced sales process o f the Borrower's most valuable subsidiaries

<<<

. The outcome of such a process is highly uncertain and will in the Borrower's view most likely be both time consuming and value destructive, especially for the Borrower's unsecured creditors and shareholders. The Borrower is convinced that

<<<

 West Face's offer and the proposed refinancing is the only and most attractive solution for the Warrant Bond and the Unsecured Bond available at this stage
3.2 NTM's evaluation
Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders

<<<

 by the Loan Trustee.
The Bondholders should independently evaluate the effects of the described restructuring in light of the present distressed situation of the Borrower, hereunder the terms of the New Bond compared to the current Loan Agreements

<<<

, such as the longer maturity, coupon and a new security package, as well as the effects of a new investor which will hold a major position both as shareholder and as an investor in the New Bond.
The request is put forward to the Bondholders

<<<

 without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable.

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA

It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel

 from their own financial, legal and tax advisers as to the possible consequences o f the Proposal.

 BACKGROUND FOR RESTRUCTURING
1 OFFER AND REFINANCING
Since M ay 2009 the Borrower has worked to solve the Borrower's financing requirement after failing on its loan amortization. Until now, the Borrower has explored various refinancing alternatives

<<<

 without finding a satisfactory solution in the interest of all stakeholders.
As a result o f the efforts to refinance, the Borrower has received signed term sheets for USD 90 million of secured bank financing for its assets in Peru and Colombia

<<<

, through two term loan facilities with Citibank. The proceeds from these loans will be used for part o f the refinancing for the USD 117 million of secured bonds (including accrued interest). Combined with other obligations, the total refinancing

<<<

 requirement is approximately USD 50 million on top o f the committed bank financing.
On 7 June 2010 West Face (Norway) AS announced its intention to put forward a conditional voluntary offer for the outstanding shares o f the Borrower at an

<<<

 offer price o f N O K 12.5 per share. In conjunction with the successful completion of the Offer, West Face (Norway AS) and/or a related party o f West Face (Norway) AS ("West Face") will also contribute up to USD 40 m illion through subscription

<<<

 o f bonds issued by the Borrower and up to USD 10 million in new equity. The new financing will be used to repay the Borrower's secured bonds in full and the Bonds are proposed to be rolled into new bonds (the "New Bond") on equal terms as

<<<

 West Face's USD 40 million cash subscription for the same N ew Bond. West Face's offer is conditional upon, among other things, getting acceptance from shareholders holding a sufficient number o f shares that, together with the shares held

<<<

 by Mårten Rød, Gian Angelo Perrucci and Nils Trulsvik ("Interoil Principals") and their holdings companies, comprise at least 90% o f the shares o f the Borrower on a fully diluted basis, and acceptance from the unsecured Bondholders to roll

<<<

 their bonds into the New Bond and receipt o f the requisite consents, waivers and postponements from the unsecured Bondholders in connection therewith. The contemplated transactions represent a full refinancing o f the Borrower subject to unsecured

<<<

 Bondholders' consent to the proposal. Furthermore, the Interoil Principals through their holding companies', Eksportconsult AS and Rakila Ltd, will convert their position in the Warrant Bond (an aggregate of USD 9 million plus accrued interest

<<<

) to equity.
2 CITIBANK FINANCING
The Borrower has through its relevant subsidiaries agreed with Citibank in Peru and Colombia on term sheets for loan facilities in the amounts o f USD 60 million and USD 30 million respectively (the "B an k

<<<

 Financing"). The purpose o f the Bank Financing is to repay the Borrower's senior secured bond debt.
The Bank Financing will be secured by i) the group's assets in Peru and Colombia, ii) a first priority share pledge o f the shares o f InterOil

<<<

 Peru S.A. and InterOil Colombia Exploration and Production Inc., iii) a guarantee from the Borrower, iv) a collateral arrangement for the cash flows from existing sales contracts, v) a collateral trust arrangement/pledge over the accounts established

<<<

 in connection with the Bank Financing and vi) excess value o f potential oil price hedges required in accordance with the terms

Organisasjonsnummer: 988 247 006

Page 1

INTEROIL
o f the Bank Financing, as well as a certain amount o f production

<<<

 being hedged in both Peru and Colombia.
The Bank Financing will carry an interest at LIBOR plus 5.5-6.5% payable on a monthly (Peru) and quarterly (Colombia) basis. A set of financial covenants are included together with limitations on further

<<<

 financial indebtedness and liens on the properties pledged in favour of the bank as well as restriction on sale of assets. Dividends or distributions to the Borrower may occur, given sufficient dividend capacity, provided there is a simultaneous

<<<

 1:1 mandatory prepayment o f the Bank Financing at par. Any prepayment will reduce future instalment amounts on a pro-rata basis for all future instalments.
If the license periods in Peru are extended or proven reserves in Colombia are increased

<<<

, Citibank has indicated that it will consider increasing the loan facilities. A right to make full prepayment (or part payment of at least USD 5 million or USD 1 million increments in excess thereof) at 102% o f par applies for the duration

<<<

 of the Bank Financing. The Borrower believes there is substantial un-tapped debt capacity in excess of the committed USD 90 million Bank Financing given extension in Peru, or an increase in proved reserves in Colombia which consequently may

<<<

 lead to early repayment o f the proposed New Bond. In the event that no license extension is obtained in Peru by 31 December 2010, 70 % o f all free cash flow in Peru will go to mandatory prepayment o f the Peru Bank Financing. In such event

<<<

, the free cash flow available to repay the New Bond will be decreased by corresponding amount.
In addition to other customary conditions precedent, it is a condition precedent to disbursement under the Bank Financing that the Borrower shall

<<<

 (i) have reached an agreement with the holders o f the Borrower's USD 117 million secured bonds for the discharge in full o f such indebtedness and release of all security therefore and (ii) have available sufficient funds for such repayment

<<<

, taking into account the proceeds from the Bank Financing.
3 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES
Shortly after W est Face's offer was announced, the Borrower was notified by the court that the Borrower's appealed court decision on enforcing share pledges

<<<

 on behalf o f the secured bond was denied. Consequently the Enforcement Officer ("Namsmannen") now has the right to enforce the share pledges on behalf o f the secured bondholders in order to repay their outstanding amount of approximately

<<<

 USD 117m. Such a process is, however, in the opinion o f the Borrower both time consuming and gives no guarantee that such a process will result in a better solution than the West Face offer as it will be challenging to find buyers willing

<<<

 to pay full price for the pledged assets in a forced sale process. The Borrower including all its independent Board members is o f the clear opinion that W est Face's offer represents the fastest process and most favourable outcome for all

<<<

 stakeholders as no other acceptable refinancing alternatives currently exists. The Borrower is of the clear opinion that West Face's offer represents a fair offer, also supported by a fairness opinion provided by SEB Ensldlda to the Borrower

<<<
