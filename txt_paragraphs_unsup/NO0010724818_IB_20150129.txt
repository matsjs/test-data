Mexico City, Mexico - January 28, 2015: Oro Negro is a Mexican limited liability company that started

<<<

 operations on February 2012, with the purpose of becoming an integrated and diversified Oil & Gas services company. Oro Negro plans to become a leading player in the Mexican oil services industry by offering integrated services and tailored

<<<

 solutions to Pemex, through the acquisition of companies with existing contracts and through the acquisition of state-of-the-art assets.
Reference is made to the bond issue known as "Oro Negro Impetus Pte. Ltd lSenior Secured Bond Issue 20

14/2015 11,00% USD C" (the "Bond Issue"] with ISIN number NO 0010724818 under which Nordic Trustee ASA is trustee and security agent.
Oro Negro Impetus Pte. Ltd (the "Company"] is aware of a minority bondholder having requested Nordic Trustee

<<<

 ASA ("Nordic Trustee"] to summon for a bondholder meeting with a view to discuss certain matters relating to the Company and requesting the substitution of Nordic Trustee as trustee and security agent. The summons have subsequently been withdrawn

<<<

.
Nordic Trustee is the leading supplier of trustee services in the Nordic region with close to 2,300 active assignments for more than NOK 1,100 billion. We have confidence that Nordic Trustee is best suited in monitoring Norwegian law bonds

<<<

 and has demonstrated integrity by not entertaining allegations without legal merit.
Oro Negro took delivery of its new rig "Impetus" on 22ndJanuary 2015 as planned. We understand that the delivery of the Impetus was seeked hindered by the same

<<<

 minority bondholder claiming that a material adverse effect had occurred and which now, through the summons, we believe is seeking to create a deceptive picture of the business of the Company.
January 2015 is the seventh straight month of declining

<<<

 oil prices and the reduced oil price was adequately reflected in the bond issuance as evidenced by a discount rate of 97% and the interest rate of 11% per annum. The Company has provided all relevant information to Nordic Trustee. The Company

<<<

's business strategy remains the same based on the same rationale as earlier presented to the market. Oro Negro is well positioned in the market and is in negotiations for a drilling contract for the Impetus.
We believe that any potential interference

<<<

 by a bondholder in the regular operation and management of the Company could impair the price of the bonds. We are and remain confident with respect to our ability to meet all obligations under the finance documents and therefore strongly oppose

<<<

 the statement by certain bondholders regarding the existence of a material adverse effect.
