 indebtedness. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other

<<<

 statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "ongoing," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "target," "seek" or similar words

<<<

 or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.
Forward-looking statements are subject to known

 and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially

<<<

 from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward

<<<

-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected

<<<

 future results include, but are not limited to:
 our ability to compete effectively in our industry;
 rapid changes in technology and our ability to successfully manage and address customer expectations;
 adverse changes in general economic

<<<

 conditions;
 our ability to retain our existing customers and to acquire new subscribers on a cost effective basis;
 our exposure to the Spanish market;
 our ability to compete effectively with bundled products and services that may be offered

<<<

 by certain of our potential competitors;
 privacy concerns and potential security breaches;
 costs associated with potential competition with our former parent or disputes over our primary brand name;
 costs associated with our continued

<<<

 investment in building our brands;
 difficulties we may face in increasing our subscriber base or our subscription fees or up-selling new products to our current subscribers;
 inability to realize efficiencies and cost savings associated

<<<

 with implemention of our FOG program;
 increased labor costs in the jurisdictions in which we operate;

currencies within the eurozone;  risks associated with our ultimate principal shareholder's interests being inconsistent with our
own;  our significant leverage, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our
business

<<<

; and  risks associated with our structure and the terms of the Notes and other indebtedness. These risks and others described under "Risk Factors" are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that

<<<

 could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry or the regulatory regimes under which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to

<<<

 predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward

<<<

 looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any forward looking statements are only made as of the date of this offering memorandum, and we do

<<<

 not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward looking statements set forth in this offering memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting

<<<

 on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements.

 in the issued and outstanding shares of its subsidiaries and its outstanding indebtedness and intercompany balances incurred in connection with the Transactions, including the Private Senior Notes. Historically we have only prepared consolidated

<<<

 financial statements at the Issuer. Beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31,2015, our results will be consolidated at Holdco.
Unaudited Pro Forma As Adjusted Financial Information
We present in this offering memorandum certain financial

<<<

 information on an as adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to the (i) "Funding our Growth Together' ("FOG") cost savings program, (ii) the annualized impact of the acquisitions of Mediaveil and Leadex, (iii) sponsor fees and (iv) the Transactions

. See "Summary--Summary Consolidated Historical and Other Data," "Capitalization," "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-- We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risk which may adversely affect our earnings

 auditing standards.
Constant Currency Information
We present certain of our financial and operating results on a constant currency basis to allow investors to compare our results of operations and certain operating metrics across periods on

 a likefor-like basis. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on financial and operating measures, we believe that evaluating these financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis provides

<<<

 an additional and meaningful assessment of revenue to management. We have removed the effects of FX changes in our discussion of certain operating and financial metrics by re-translating each period's non-euro denominated results using a constant

<<<

 rate of exchange for each of the applicable currencies. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flow. These non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them

 and SSNOCF, are not specifically defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry

<<<

 as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance, liquidity and financing structure. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally

<<<

 accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as alternatives to gross profit, operating profit any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures

<<<

 used by other companies. Our management believes this information, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. These measures are

<<<

 used in the internal management of our business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures, in evaluating the operating performance.
x
LO\5912661.4

The EBITDA and other non-IFRS metrics have limitations as analytical

<<<

 tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. Some of these limitations are:
 they do not reflect our cash

<<<

 expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;
 they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
 they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest

<<<

 or principal payments on our debt;
 they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;
 they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement;
 they

<<<

 do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;
 assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced

<<<

 in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
 other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Because

<<<

 of these limitations, such metrics should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate

<<<

 for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See "Sum mary-Summary Consolidated Historical and Other Data," "Selected Consolidated Historical

<<<

 Financial Data," "Management's Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
In this offering memorandum

<<<

 we also present certain performance indicators for each of our segments, which we refer to as "operating metrics." Certain of the operating metrics are not specifically defined under IFRS. These measures are presented in this offering memorandum

<<<

 because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and financing structure. We have defined each of the metrics and shown their calculation in "Sum mary

<<<

-Summary Consolidated Historical and Other Data." The metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles. These non-IFRS measures

<<<

 have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. You should compensate for these

<<<

 limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance.

SUMMARY
The following summary highlights selected information

<<<

 from this offering memorandum. The following summary does not contain all o f the information you should consider before you invest in the Notes and should be read in conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information

<<<

 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results o f Operations" for additional factors that you should consider before investing

<<<

 in the Notes.
Overview
We are the leading provider of monitored alarm solutions for residential households and small businesses in Europe. We offer premium monitored alarm services to our portfolio of approximately 1.9 million customers (as

<<<

 of June 30, 2015) and design, sell and install alarms with network connectivity across 14 countries in Europe and Latin America. Our management estimates, based on third party data, that as of June 30, 2015, we were the leading provider of

<<<

 premium monitored alarm services in four out of five of our largest markets in Europe (representing 72.4% of Group revenue on a last quarter annualized basis). Since our company was founded in 1988, we have continually expanded our customer

<<<

 base, growing at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 17% from 2000 to June 2015. As of June 30, 2015, our residential households accounted for 76% of our customers, while small businesses accounted for 24%. Based on our historical trends

<<<

, we currently estimate that our residential customers remain with us, on average by geography, 8-16 years and our small business customers remain with us, on average, 5-8 years. As a result, we believe that our Portfolio Services revenues,

<<<

 representing 85.6% of our revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 annualized, provide us with a high-margin, stable source of recurring cash flow. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, annualized, we generated revenue of 999.5 million and

<<<

 Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA of 400.3 million.
We operate a subscription-based service business, which we conduct through two operating segments:
 Portfolio Services. Our Portfolio Services segment provides monitoring services to our 1.9 million

<<<

 customers for a monthly subscription fee. We typically enter into self-renewing monitoring agreements with our customers at the time of installation, and the majority of our customers pay via direct debit. We then monitor our installed base

<<<

 of alarms through 12 dedicated monitoring centers located throughout Europe and Latin America to verify triggered alarms and initiate an appropriate response. We also provide customer service and technical support for all our installed systems

<<<

. We have had low customer cancellation rates (churn) of approximately 8% annually over the last five years, having recently declined to 6.8% as of June 30, 2015. This low cancellation rate contributes to the stable and recurring cash flow that

<<<

 the segment generates allowing us to fund investment to grow our customer base. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015 annualized, our Portfolio Services segment generated revenue of 855.2 million (representing 85.6% of our total revenue) and

<<<

 Adjusted EBITDA of 517.1 million (representing a 60.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin).
 Customer Acquisition. Our Customer Acquisition segment sells to, and installs our alarm systems for, new customers in return for an upfront sales and installation

<<<

 fee. This installation fee typically only covers a portion of the costs associated with marketing, selling, purchasing equipment and installing each alarm system. As a result, the segment represents an up front investment (including both costs

<<<

 reflected in our income statements and capital expenditures) in our business to acquire new customers. These new customers then become part of our Portfolio Services segment, driving revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and profitability growth. Due to

<<<

 the discretionary nature of our customer acquisition activities, we are able to increase our sales, marketing and installation investment activities to grow our customer base, or, alternatively, reduce our investment in such activities to maximize

<<<

 our cash on hand, over the short to medium term.
We offer a range of alarm systems with a variety of features, ranging from simple break-in detectors to more complex alarms with premium features, such as sophisticated cameras, home environment

<<<

 monitoring capabilities, such as smoke, and two-way audio communication. These alarm systems are directly connected to our monitoring centers, as well as to our customers through our web-based "MyPages" application and our mobile Verisure App

<<<

, available on Apple iOS, Android and Microsoftbased smartphones. These applications allow our customers to set, monitor and control various alarm functions and settings. While we primarily market under the Securitas Direct brand, we have developed

and launched an innovative line of products, which represent our newest technology and most advanced features (including our Verisure App), which we sell under the Verisure brand.

Our Operating Markets

We have operations

<<<

 in eleven European countries (Spain, Sweden, France, Norway, Portugal, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and the United Kingdom (where we have a pilot project)) and three Latin American countries (Chile, Brazil and Peru). Our

<<<

 largest markets in terms of customers are Spain, Sweden, France, Norway and Portugal which, combined, accounted for 87% of our total customers as of June 30, 2015. Spain is our largest market and represented 40% of our customers as of June

<<<

 30, 2015. Additionally, residential households accounted for 76% of our customers, while small businesses accounted for 24% as of June 30, 2015. The charts below show our customer base by geographic breakdown and by customer type as of June

We launched limited operations in Brazil in 2011 and acquired

<<<

 a 90% stake in TeleAtlantic in the third quarter of 2014 to further build-out our Brazilian operations. TeleAtlantic had approximately 21,000 customers as of July 31, 2014 and we have also acquired a small portfolio of customers in Chile in

<<<

 2014. We further added approximately 10,000 customers through our acquisition of Leadex Investments AB in Sweden in May, 2015. Since we first began operations, we have pursued a primarily organic growth strategy when expanding into new markets

<<<

, including Peru and Italy, complemented by selective add-on acquisitions to bolster our position in existing markets.
Our History
We were founded in Sweden in 1988 as a division of Securitas AB, initially focusing on the Swedish residential

<<<

 home security market. Within our first ten years of operations, we had expanded our platform internationally, entering the home security markets of Norway, Spain, France and Finland, with subsequent expansion into Portugal and the Netherlands

<<<

 in 2001 and 2005, respectively. In September 2006, we separated from Securitas AB and were listed on the OMX Stockholm Nordic Exchange, before being taken private in an acquisition by EQT Holdings AB in August 2008. In 2009, we entered the

<<<

 Latin American market by establishing operations in Chile. We were acquired by Bain and H&F on September 2, 2011.
Our Strengths

Clear industry leader with scale and a track record of resilient growth
We are the leading provider of residential and small business monitored alarm solutions in Europe. We

<<<

 are present in 14 countries across Europe and South America and are the leading provider of premium monitored alarm services in four of our five largest markets in Europe, which together represented 72.4% of our revenue on a last quarter annualized

<<<

 basis, as shown in the following table:

Geographic Presence

Europe

Latin America

= M arket P osition
As of June 30, 2015
We estimate, based on available industry data, that we are approximately five times larger than our single nearest

<<<

 competitor across our five largest markets, on a combined basis, based on our average number of subscribers in 2014. We believe our leading market position in these markets and across Europe is due to our differentiated business model. We offer

<<<

 premium monitored alarm services that include high quality products tailored to the residential and small business markets. Our installation and subscription services are delivered by experienced face-to-face salespeople who serve as the customers

<<<

' first point of contact.
Market leader with scale
In 2014, within the market of currently installed alarms, we were the largest player in four out of five of our largest operating countries, Spain, Sweden, Norway and Portugal, in which we held

<<<

 a relative market share of customers (compared to our nearest competitors) of 4.8 times, 2.8 times, 1.3 times, and 2.1 times respectively. We also believe our market position is further strengthened by high brand awareness in our largest markets

<<<

.
As the largest pan-European monitored alarm service provider in our markets, we have the flexibility to dedicate necessary resources to marketing, advertising and selling activities to further sustain and grow brand awareness and our subscriber

<<<

 base. For example, management estimates that our sales force in Spain with over 1,500 employees is several times larger than our closest competitor, which we believe has allowed us to continue gaining market share and acquiring new customers

<<<

 faster than our competitors. We believe that the depth and scale of our activities provide us with a significant advantage in competing for talented employees, by allowing us to offer a leading, growing and international career platform. Furthermore

<<<

, we can invest adequate resources in product development to drive the introduction of new technologies and features into our alarm systems which drives upselling, enhances subscribers' engagement and experience and, as a result, reduces churn

<<<

. As a result of our efforts, we have been successful in introducing new products and technologies to enhance our value proposition to our customers such as anti-jamming services.

Track record o f resilient growth
We have

<<<

 been able to grow our subscriber base every year since 2000, from approximately 194,000 to approximately 1.9 million as of June 30, 2015, which is a CAGR of approximately 17%. We believe that our scale coupled with the differentiation provided

<<<

 by our brand trust and awareness, service-focused sales force coverage and direct go-to-market ("GTM") model (wherein our large network of field sales representatives reach out to potential customers), our focus on innovation and our ability

<<<

 to attract talented employees have resulted in a track record of above-market growth in certain of our markets. For example, in Spain from 2010 to 2014, we grew the number of our customers at a CAGR of 3.3% compared to an estimated 1.4% for

<<<

 all other market participants (based on third-party data), while in France during that same period we grew our customer base at a CAGR of 19.3% compared to 7.4% for all other market participants (based on third party data).
Favorable market

<<<

 dynamics with low penetration rates
Low penetration rates
We believe that there is substantial potential for further penetration of residential monitored alarms in Europe, which we anticipate will continue to provide us with profitable growth

<<<

 opportunities. Residential monitored alarm penetration rates remain relatively low in the markets in which we operate. According to third-party data and our estimates, the average penetration by country in European residential monitored alarms

<<<

 in 2014 was estimated to be approximately 6%, compared to approximately 20% in the residential sector of the more-developed U.S. market. Within Europe, seven of the 11 markets in which we have operations have average penetration rates below

<<<

 the European average.
We believe that the primary driver of the different penetration rates between the United States and Europe is historically lower marketing spending in Europe and, as a result, lower consumer awareness of the benefits of

<<<

 security systems. As we have focused on increasing product awareness, through our GTM model, our European operations have shown strong growth. From 2011 to June 30, 2015, we grew our subscriber base in Europe from approximately 1,438,000 to

<<<

 1,822,000.
Significant market know-how in an industry with scope for differentiation
We believe that there is significant scope for differentiation in the alarm monitoring business.
 First, market participants need to gain awareness and brand

<<<

 trust among customers in order to be given permission to monitor customers' families and assets. This not only requires an established presence in the market but a field sales organization of a certain size. The GTM model requires interplay

<<<

 of customized products, brand, recruitment, training, lead generation and allocation, which we believe is highly complex to build and operate. We also seek to tailor our approach to the markets in which we are operating in order to deliver

<<<

 differentiated service to our customers that indicates comprehensive understanding of cultural norms and communities.
 Second, we believe that scale, including on a regional basis, is a differentiating factor in the alarm monitoring market

<<<

. Scale provides avenues for increased investment in innovative product and service features, greater customization of products to fit GTM efforts, enhanced monitoring and response service and the ability to drive lead generation through marketing

<<<

 spend.
 Third, the demands of customer safety and well-being drives significantly higher service level requirements than in many other subscription-based businesses which we are able to address through deep customer know-how, our twelve monitoring

<<<

 centers and our sizeable sales force.
We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from these market dynamics owing to our established competitive position, the strength of brand and reputation, our scale and density of operations, our

<<<

 differentiated GTM model with experienced face-to-face salespeople, our technology and diversified customer base.
Subscription business with diversified, high quality and resilient customer base with low churn
We have a geographically diversified

<<<

 portfolio of approximately 1.9 million customers as of June 30, 2015. Our focus on markets throughout Europe, including Scandinavia and Southern Europe, as well as certain markets in Latin America helps mitigate the risks of localized economic

<<<

 downturns. Our

LO\5912661.4

4

residential customers tend to be middle-to-higher income households with assets to protect and lower price sensitivity. In order to ensure subscriber loyalty, we charge upfront fees of several hundred euro

<<<

 or more, which helps screen for more-committed customers and, we believe, increases the likelihood of customers continuing to use our system over the long-term. The resilience of the demand for our security systems is underpinned by the strength

<<<

 and reputation of our brand and the nature of the services we offer, as we address the safety of our customers' families and property, and we believe customers view our solutions as less discretionary than other expenditures. As such, we believe

<<<

 that customers are less prone to cancel our services during economic downturns. Consequently, we currently estimate that our residential customers, which represented 76% of our total customers as of June 30, 2015, have an expected subscription

<<<

 life of between 8 and 16 years.
Track record o f churn improvement
In addition to our diversified, high quality customer base, we have been able to drive down churn by focusing our sales incentive scheme on lower churn customers such as residential

<<<

 customers and professional services (e.g., doctors, lawyers) and reducing commissions for higher churn businesses. Management has also implemented other initiatives to reduce churn including data led predictive analytics which indicate when

<<<

 customers are at a higher risk of churning (e.g., long periods of inactivity), and specific initiatives for house moves. Our deep customer retention know-how and on going customer service efforts have facilitated the recent decrease in our

<<<

 cancellation rates (as shown in the chart below), and consequently, allowed for better revenue growth and greater cash flow generation.

Strong and stable cash flow generation with ability

<<<

 to flexibly manage growth

Our Portfolio Services segment, which holds our portfolio of approximately 1.9 million customers as of June 30, 2015, generates substantial cash flow through our subscription-based revenues, with Adjusted EBITDA for

<<<

 Portfolio Services of 129.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 (representing a 60.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin) and Adjusted EBITDA for Portfolio Services of 517.1 million on a last quarter annualized basis. The profitability of

<<<

 our Portfolio Services segment results from its relatively low operating cost and capital expenditure requirements (in the Portfolio Services segment, capital expenditures amounted to 5.5% of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 201

<<<

5). While our subscriber growth is dependent on our Customer Acquisition segment, we have discretion when to invest in acquiring new customers to either replace cancelling customers or grow our existing subscriber base. Our historically low

<<<

 churn rate has meant that we do not need to divert significant resources towards customer replacement costs. As such, we have flexibility in how we invest the substantial cash flow generated by the Portfolio Services segment. In the three months

<<<

 ended June 30, 2015, we invested 67.1% of our Adjusted EBITDA from the Portfolio Services segment to acquire new customers and used the remaining 32.9% of our Adjusted EBITDA primarily to service our debt and for capital expenditures and other

<<<

 general corporate purposes. As a result of the

LO\5912661.4

5

discretionary nature of our Customer Acquisition spend, we are able to efficiently manage our growth, reducing our costs and capital expenditure requirements and allowing us

<<<

 to use additional cash flow for debt service requirements or other purposes. If, on the other hand, we invest our additional cash flow to acquire new customers, it allows us to potentially grow our Adjusted EBITDA in the long term.
Track record

<<<

 of profitable growth and deleveraging, including during economic downturns
We have a consistent track record of profitable growth despite ongoing economic uncertainty in some of our markets. For example, from 2012 to the quarter ended June

<<<

 30, 2015, we were able to increase our Portfolio Services Adjusted EBITDA margin from 53.2% to 60.5%. Both in Spain and Portugal, where the effects of the economic downturn were among the most severe in Europe, we continued to expand our operations

<<<

. Between 2008 and 2010 we were able to grow our customers in Spain and Portugal by 8.4% and 48.9%, respectively despite GDP contracting by 4.0% and 1.0% respectively. In Spain, from 2010 to 2013, during a period of continued economic uncertainty

<<<

 we were able to grow our customers by 6.5%, while GDP fell 2.8%. Likewise, in Portugal during the same period, we were able to grow our customers by 37.6%, while GDP fell by 5.8%.

Our management team, supported by our strong regional teams, has a successful operating history with us, with our founders still serving in leadership or advisory roles. Under their

Over time, we have implemented a decentralized model in which regional teams and local salesinstallers are fully accountable

 for their portfolio of customers and incentivized to deliver sustainable growth and value creation. Our strong culture and strategic alignment across geographies, including sharing of best practices, is another source of competitive differentiation

Our management team are a blend of new talent from the consumer and telecom industries as well as those who have significant history with the business. Our two founders, Dick Seger and Luis Gil, are still involved in critical

<<<

 roles that support our plans for further growth, expansion and innovation. Our Chief Executive Officer, Austin Lally, led the development of our strategic roadmap with our management team, founders and Sponsor, leveraging his experience of

<<<

 over 25 years in building and growing leading consumer businesses in Europe, the United States and Asia.
Our Strategies
We intend to continue driving our customer-centred model to deliver peace of mind and protection to our customers through

<<<

 a technology enabled human services approach encompassing professional grade installation, professional monitoring, response and call outs. We aim to adapt our services based on deep customer insight. We are focused on continuing to develop

<<<

 first-to-market solutions that later become industry standards and ensure that we have a leading portfolio of security solutions. We have also developed and will seek to continue to effectively implement strategic initiatives to increase customer

<<<

 retention, such as facilitating the transfer of our services in connection with home moves and offering customers remote access to their alarm systems via the internet and the Verisure App.
Continue to increase penetration of monitored alarms

<<<

 for residential and small business customers in Europe and Latin America market
We believe significant growth opportunities remain in our existing markets, as evidenced by the low penetration rates compared to other jurisdictions. We aim to

<<<

 further expand our subscriber base in these markets in a measured manner by continuing to target potential customers who meet our customer demographics and economics criteria by increasing the quantity and quality of our leads and investing

<<<

 in our portfolio of brands. Moreover we may consider selective acquisitions to increase our subscriber base in certain regions. We believe many of our potential customers are not yet familiar with the benefits of having a monitored alarm system

<<<

. Thus, we plan to use our large face-to-face sales force, unique GTM model, strong brand and broad product offerings to continue to grow our subscriber base. Growing our subscriber base should enable us to increase our profit margins, because

<<<

 we will be able to benefit from the density and economies of scale of our Portfolio Services segment. Additionally, given that our average payback period (the time it takes to recover the cost of acquiring a new subscriber and installing an

<<<

 alarm system) is approximately 4 years and that we estimate that our residential customers will have subscription lives of between 8 and 16 years, we believe growing our subscriber base is a strategy worth pursuing.
Strive to provide the best

<<<

 security solution available and do our utmost to protect our customers
Our in-house development teams cooperate closely with our network of equipment manufacturers to design and deliver new products and services to our customers. Our disciplined

<<<

 focus on research and development allows us to efficiently manage our new product development costs and strategically invest where we expect the returns will be the highest. We believe that our scale provides us with a significant competitive

<<<

 advantage in investing in product development, and we have introduced a number of successful innovations over the years (e.g., our Verisure "MyPages" home automation platform, which enables the customer to remotely access their premises over

<<<

 the internet or through the Verisure App on their smartphone). We plan to continue to invest in research and development to introduce new technologies and features into our alarm systems, thereby increasing up-selling and enhancing our customers

<<<

' engagement and experience, which we believe will increase customer loyalty and reduce churn.
Focus on achieving the highest levels of customer satisfaction and loyally in the industry
We recognize that customer satisfaction is directly proportional

<<<

 to customer loyalty and, therefore, we consistently strive to maintain the highest levels of customer satisfaction in the industry in order to reduce churn. As our first point-of-contact with our customers, our salespeople, some of whom are

<<<

 also responsible for installing our systems, provide ongoing customer assistance and are one of our greatest assets in achieving this goal. We have further implemented a sales incentive program that rewards our dedicated sales-force for identifying

<<<

 high quality customers while aligning the interests of our salespeople with our customers by measuring customer satisfaction at key points of interaction (including sales visits, service visits and customer service calls). In addition, we strategically

<<<

 focus on

LO\5912661.4

7

traditionally low-churn customers (e.g. residential and professional services business customers) and increase our customer engagement by providing innovative new services (such as anti-jamming technology and our

<<<

 Verisure App) while also implementing policies aimed at increasing the quality of our customer base (such as upfront installation fees that help to identify more-committed customers).
Deliver industry leading profitability through cost optimization

<<<

 and operational excellence
By increasing customer engagement and offering additional services, we believe we will continue to deliver industry-leading churn and increase average revenue per customer (ARPU). Additionally, we are striving to

<<<

 implement a number of measures for efficiency gains replicating best practices. For example, we are currently in the implementation phase of our FOG cost savings program, under which we expect to realize cash savings of approximately 27 million

<<<

 by June 2016, with the full program targeting over twice this amount. The FOG program includes selected cost categories of our business (portfolio operations, direct spend and indirect procurement and spend (excluding marketing spend)).
These

<<<

 initiatives are intended to improve our performance in customer care, reduce direct material costs and operating expenses, sustainably improve product quality and enhance our business stability. We have done substantial work to identify cost

<<<

 savings and develop these initiatives, including working with third-party consultants, and seek to leverage our managers' expertise, which includes successful implementation of similar programs. See "Business-- Product Offerings and Product

<<<

For the eight months ended August 31,2015, our revenue and Portfolio Services revenue were 667.4 million and 573.4 million, respectively, increasing 15.3% and 14.5%, respectively, compared

<<<

 to the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our customer base, as well as an increase in average revenue per user ("ARPU"). Our customer base increased from approximately 1,734,000 as of August 31,2014, to over

<<<

 1,925,000 as of August 31,2015, while our cancellation rate decreased from 8.1% to 6.8% as of August 31, 2015 as compared to August 31, 2014. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services were 240.0 million and 345.5 million,

<<<

 respectively, for the eight months ended August 31, 2015, an increase of 16.6% and 19.0%, respectively, over the same period in 2014. Within our portfolio segment this translates to an increase in monthly Adjusted EBITDA per subscriber ("EPC

<<<

") from 21.6 to 23.2, as a result of the increase in ARPU as well as operating efficiencies. In the same period, ARPU increased from 37.3 to 38.5 and cash acquisition cost per new customer ("CPA") increased slightly from 1,079 to 1,141.
On a

 and it is a measure that we use in managing our business. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this offering memorandum, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these

(5) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

(6) We define SSNOCF as Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services,

 less discretionary net investment required to replace cancellations on a per subscriber basis ("CPA") multiplied by the number of cancellations during the relevant periods. SSNOCF is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not

 required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. SSNOCF is not a measurement of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider SSNOCF as an alternative to (a) gross profit or operating profit (as determined in accordance

 the underlying operating cash flow generation for our business in a steady state environment (i.e. replacing cancellations) and the discretionary nature of the net investments we make. SSNOCF, as presented in this offering memorandum, however

 in reconciliation with gross new subscribers added and cancellations are due to geographical and other variations in subscriber databases and acquisitions.

(11) Subscriber growth rate, net, represents the net subscriber growth during the relevant

<<<

 period divided by the number of subscribers at the beginning of that period.

(12) Cancellations (number of subscribers), represent the total number of cancelled subscriptions during the period, including cancellations on acquired portfolios

<<<

.

(13) During 2014, we modified our reporting methodology related to cancellations and new subscribers added when customers moved and kept their subscription to harmonize the approach across jurisdictions. The impact of this modification was

<<<

 a change of 5,701 for full year 2014, resulting in both a lower cancellation number and a lower number of new subscribers as compared to what would have been the case under the prior methodological approach. Net subscriber growth was not affected

<<<

 by the modification in the reporting methodology.

(14) Cancellation rate (or churn) represents the number of terminated subscriptions (excluding cancellations from acquired portfolios) to our monitoring service during a twelve month period

<<<

 as a percentage of the average number of subscribers (excluding acquired portfolios) during that twelve month period.

(15) Monthly average revenue per user ("ARPU") is our Portfolio Services segment revenue consisting of monthly average subscription

<<<

 fees and sales of additional products and services divided by the average number of subscribers during the relevant period.

(16) Monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer ("EPC") is calculated by dividing the total monthly Adjusted EBITDA from

<<<

 managing our existing subscriber portfolio (which is our Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services) by the average number of subscribers for that period.

(17) We evaluate the performance of our operating segments and allocate resources to those

<<<

 segments based on our analysis of Adjusted EBITDA for each of our segments. Adjusted EBITDA for our segments is defined as revenue minus operating expenses before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, write offs and integration costs

<<<

. Adjusted EBITDA for our segments is not a measure of financial condition or performance determined in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services reflects the cash generative segment of our business. Adjusted EBITDA from

<<<

 Customer Acquisition is negative in each period and reflects investment in our business.

(18) Adjusted EBITDA Margin from Portfolio Services represents Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services as a percentage

(20) CPA is the net investment required to acquire a subscriber, including costs related to the marketing and sales process, installation

<<<

 of the alarm system, costs of alarm system products and overhead expenses for the customer acquisition process. The metric is calculated net of any revenues from installation fees charged to the subscriber and represents the sum of Adjusted

<<<

 EBITDA plus capital expenditures in our Customer Acquisition segment on average for every subscriber acquired.
(21) CPA was impacted by a 8.0 non-cash adjustment relating to financing of installation fees for certain customer segments for the

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2014. CPA excluding this non-cash adjustment would have been 1,095 for the year ended December 31,2014.
(22) Payback period represents the time in years required to recapture the initial capital investment made to acquire

<<<

 a new subscriber and is calculated as CPA divided by Adjusted EBITDA per customer.
(23) As adjusted secured indebtedness represents our secured indebtedness as of June 30, 2015, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the

<<<

 Offering and the repayment of the Existing Notes and other secured indebtedness, as if they had occurred on June 30, 2015. The presentation assumes that no drawings have been made under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pro forma secured indebtedness

<<<

 has also been adjusted to include the additional 8.1 million of local facilities that we assumed in connection with the Mediaveil Acquisition. As adjusted secured indebtedness has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport

<<<

 to reflect what our secured leverage would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our secured indebtedness for any future period. In addition, the definition of "senior secured indebtedness

<<<

" for the purposes of calculation of the covenants under the Indenture differs from "secured indebtedness" as presented herein.
(24) As adjusted total funded indebtedness represents our total funded indebtedness (including our obligations under

<<<

 the Private Senior Notes) as of June 30, 2015, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the repayment of our Existing Notes and other indebtedness, as if they had occurred on June 30, 2015. The presentation

<<<

 assumes that no drawings have been made under the Revolving Credit Facility. As adjusted total funded indebtedness has also been adjusted to include the additional 8.1 million of local facilities that we assumed in connection with the Mediaveil

<<<

 Acquisition. As adjusted total funded indebtedness has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to reflect what our indebtedness would have actually been had the Transactions and the Mediaveil Acquisition occurred

<<<

 on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our indebtedness for any future period.
(25) As adjusted interest expense for the twelve months ended June 30, 2015 represents our finance costs (including the interest on the Private Senior

<<<

 Notes Proceeds Loan (assuming paid in cash) which has been calculated assuming a fixed interest rate for all Private Senior Notes for the twelve months ended June 30, 2015), as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, including the Offering

<<<

 and the repayment of our Existing Notes and other indebtedness, as if they occurred on July 1, 2014. The presentation assumes that no drawings have been made under the Revolving Credit Facility. As adjusted interest expense excludes charges

<<<

 related to amortized debt issuance costs. As adjusted interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to reflect what our interest expense would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on the

<<<

 date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period. In addition, the definition of "consolidated interest expense" for the purposes of calculation of the covenants under the Indenture may differ from "interest

<<<

 expense" as presented herein.
(26) Last two quarters annualized represents the applicable metric for the period from January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015, multiplied by two.
(27) Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last quarter annualized, represents our

<<<

 last quarter of Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by four, and adjusted to (a) include anticipated cost savings from July 1,2015 to June 30, 2016 pursuant to our FOG cost savings program and our estimate of the full-year EBITDA contribution of two

<<<

 businesses we acquired in May and July 2015, respectively, (b) exclude the effects of the payment of sponsor fees.
The calculation of annualized Adjusted EBITDA by multiplying last quarter Adjusted EBITDA by four does not represent the method

<<<

 used to calculate our "Consolidated EBITDA" under the Indenture for purposes of our covenants, including debt incurrence and restricted payments. In the Indenture, "Consolidated EBITDA" is required to be calculated on the basis of Consolidated

<<<

 EBITDA for the last two quarters, multiplied by two. Therefore, we also present our Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last two quarters annualized, which represents our last two quarters of Adjusted EBITDA, multiplied by two, and adjusted to (a) include

<<<

 anticipated cost savings from July 1,2015 to June 30, 2016 pursuant to the FOG program and our

LO\5912661.4

26

estimate of the full-year EBITDA contribution of two business we acquired in May and July 2015, respectively, and (b) exclude

<<<

 the effects of the payment of sponsor fees.
The Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last quarter annualized, and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last two quarters annualized, information presented in this offering memorandum are inherently subject to risks

<<<

 and uncertainties. They do not present our reported results of operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, and are not comparable to our consolidated financial statements or other financial information included elsewhere in this offering

<<<

 memorandum. In addition, neither Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last quarter annualized, nor Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last two quarters annualized, purports to indicate our future consolidated results of operations. Our actual results may differ

<<<

 significantly from those reflected in our Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last quarter annualized, and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last two quarters annualized. Further, the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" for the purposes of calculation of the

<<<

 covenants under the Indenture may differ from Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last quarter annualized, and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last two quarters annualized as presented herein. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Non-IFRS

<<<

 Financial and Operating Information" and the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" in "Description of Notes."

The pro forma and adjusted information presented below is for illustrative purposes only. This information does not represent the results

<<<

 we would have achieved had the acquisition of Leadex and the Mediaveil Acquisition been completed on July 1,2014, or had we begun implementing the FOG program on July 1,2014. The calculations of Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA are based on various

<<<

 assumptions, management estimates and the partial reflection of such acquisitions in our last quarter and last two quarters annualized. The historical EBITDA for Mediaveil and partial EBITDA for Leadex used to calculate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA

<<<

 may not be representative of what such business's EBITDA would have been for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2015 or will be for the full year 2015. These numbers have not been and cannot be audited, reviewed or verified by any independent

<<<

 accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not, in the case of Mediaveil, give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired entities prior

<<<

 to their acquisition by us or may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

Adjusted

<<<

 Pro Forma EBITDA is included in this offering memorandum because we believe that it provides a useful measure of our results of operations; however, this measure does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS and you should

<<<

 not consider Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA as an alternative to operating profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as measure of our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies, including those in our industry

<<<

, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently from us. Because all companies do not calculate these financial measures in the same manner the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly

<<<

 titled measures of other companies.

We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate as a method of supplemental analysis. Our presentation of Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA should not be construed as an inference

<<<

 that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The following table sets forth the components of Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last two quarters annualized, and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, last quarter annualized.

(a) Represents Adjusted EBITDA for the two quarters ended June 30, 2015 multiplied by two, and Adjusted EBITDA for the

(b) We are currently in the initial implementation phase of the FOG cost savings program, which includes the implementation of efficiency initiatives in selected cost categories

<<<

 of our business (portfolio operations, direct spend and indirect spend (excluding marketing spend)). See "Business--Product Offerings and Product Strategy--Funding Our Growth Together-- Cost Savings Initiative."
Between July 1, 2015 and June

<<<

 30, 2016, we estimate that we will realize approximately 27 million in cost savings. We believe that the cost savings through June 30, 2016 would be attributable to (a) savings from daily operations in the areas of maintenance, service monitoring

<<<

, call outs and customer care (approximately 67% of potential savings for the relevant period), (b) renegotiation of costs on purchased materials, supply chain optimization and technical improvements (approximately 14% of potential savings for

<<<

 the relevant period) and (c) savings from leveraging our purchasing volumes (approximately 19% of potential savings for the relevant period). In connection with implementation of the cost savings initiative, we will incur one-time costs of

<<<

 approximately 6 million, comprising both capital expenditure and operating expenses. Our ability to realize these savings on the timetable anticipated is based upon internal as well as external factors and assumptions, including, without limitation

<<<

, local and macroeconomic conditions, engagement with third parties (including contract counterparties), timely launch of various requests for proposals, foreign exchange rates, successful training with respect to customer care efficiency initiatives

<<<

, effective rollout of automation of various systems, the implementation of initiatives in daily operations, follow-ups by management and effective leverage of successful strategies across jurisdictions, among other key factors. The

LO\591

<<<

2661.4

27

assumptions used in estimating our cost savings are subject to a wide variety of business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our cost savings

<<<

 estimates. We can provide no assurances that we will realize our cost savings target in the timeframe specified, if at all. See "Risk Factors-- Risk Related to Our Business and Industry-- We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation

<<<

 risk which may adversely affect our earnings, and we may not be able to successfully implement our comprehensive cost savings program, FOG.
(c) In May 2015, we completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Leadex, a Swedish provider of security

<<<

 services to residential customers. We estimate that, had the acquisition occurred on July 1, 2014, Leadex would have generated EBITDA of 0.9 million. The estimate is based on the annualization of new installations, portfolio EBITDA and CPA

<<<

 reduction following the acquisition over the period from June 1,2015 to August 31,2015, as well as a CPA capitalization rate of 50% (as per our accounting policies).
In July 2015, we completed the acquisition of Securifin SAS, which indirectly

<<<

 owns an 83.8% stake in Mediaveil, a French security company. During the year ended December 31,2014, Securifin group's revenue was 9.6 million. We estimate that, had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015, Mediaveil would generate EBITDA

<<<

 of 2.8 million for the fiscal year 2015. The estimate is based on actual Mediaveil EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014, adjusted for expected synergies, new installations, portfolio EBITDA and CPA, as well as a CPA capitalization rate

<<<

 of 50% (as per our accounting policies). We estimate that had the Mediaveil Acquisition occurred on July 1, 2014, Mediaveil would have generated EBIt Da of 2.2 million.
The presentation of full-year EBITDA attributable to Leadex and Mediaveil

<<<

 is based on a number of significant assumption and estimates. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully integrate Leadex and Mediaveil in our Group, that the expected synergies that have been taken into account for purposes

<<<

 of the pro forma adjustments will materialize or that our other estimates and assumptions (which are forward-looking in nature) are or will prove accurate in all material respects.
(d) Represents annual fees paid to the current shareholders

<<<

 in return for certain monitoring and other services. We have excluded these fees on the basis that (a) they are not related to our ongoing operations and (b) the sponsor does not expect to charge similar fees following the date of the Transactions

<<<

.

RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this offering memorandum before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks may have

<<<

 a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results o f operations, and as a result you may lose all or part o fyour original investment. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties

<<<

 not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition orresults o f operations.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
We operate in a highly competitive

<<<

 industry and our results may be adversely affected by this competition.
We face significant competition from both established and new competitors. In some instances, we compete against companies with greater scale, easier access to financing

<<<

, greater personnel resources, greater brand name recognition and experience or longer-established relationships with customers.
The residential home and small business security market (the "RHSB market") in Europe and Latin America is highly

<<<

 fragmented and subject to significant competition and pricing pressures. As a result, within our industry, we must compete against a variety of players who use various different strategies. For example, our largest competitor in Sweden and

<<<

 Norway, Sector Alarm, focuses on a particular region (the Nordic area), while our largest competitor in France, EPS, offers different monthly fees depending on the type of residence (apartments and houses). Likewise, any of our existing competitors

<<<

 may expand their current product and service offerings more rapidly, adapt to new or emerging technologies more quickly, take advantage of acquisitions or devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services, than

<<<

 we do. For example, ADT, which has a larger customer portfolio than ours, though lower customer growth, could decide to divert more of its resources to the marketing of its services. Our competitors may also price their products and services

<<<

 more aggressively than we price ours in an effort to increase their customer base and win market share. For example, we often charge a higher installation fee than our competitors and our largest competitor in Spain, Prosegur, has also begun

<<<

 to focus on Latin America where they are offering lower prices. Consumers may find the lower installation fees of our competitors attractive, which could have a significant effect on our ability to maintain or grow our customer base. Likewise

<<<

, if our competitors charge lower ongoing monitoring fees than we do, we may have to reduce our monitoring fees or risk losing our existing customers. These competitive actions could impact our ability to attract new customers, subject us to

<<<

 pricing pressure or erode our existing customer portfolio, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We also face potential competition from improvements in established

<<<

 do-it-yourself ("DIY") self monitoring systems, which, through the internet, text messages, emails or similar communications, enable consumers to monitor and control their home environment through devices that they install without third-party

<<<

 involvement. Continued pricing pressure or improvements in technology, as well as increased smart phone penetration, and shifts in consumer preferences towards DIY and self monitoring could adversely impact our customer base or pricing structure

<<<

 and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
With respect to competition from potential new entrants, we believe that players operating in the connected home market and telecommunications

<<<

 market are best situated to move into the security and safety industry. While within the connected home market, security and safety is the largest growing segment, the connected home market itself is growing quickly and covers many different

<<<

 products and services in segments such as utility management, entertainment, wellness management and smart appliances. If competitors in these alternative segments move into the security and safety segment of the connected home market, such

<<<

 action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, large players in other industries, such as Samsung, Apple and Microsoft have recently launched smart home platforms. Such

<<<

 players could leverage their well-known brand names to enter the security and safety segment of the connected home market. For example, in June of 2014, Google's Nest, which produces thermostats and smoke detectors, acquired Dropcam (a security

<<<

 camera company). Such actions could impact our ability to attract new customers, subject us to pricing pressure or erode our existing customer portfolio, each of

LO\5912661.4

29

which could have a material adverse effect on our business

<<<

, financial condition and results of operations. Telecommunications players have already shown interest in entering the security and safety market in Europe and Comcast has already done so in the United States. Given the extensive customer base

<<<

 of larger telecommunications players, if they are able to successfully develop security monitoring capabilities, they may be able to leverage their existing customer contacts to rapidly grow this segment of their business.
The success o f our

<<<

 business depends, in part, on our ability to respond to the rapid changes in our industry and provide customers with technological features that meet their expectations.
Our success and competitive position depend, in large part, on our ability

<<<

 to develop and supply innovative products and keep pace with technological developments in the security alarm industry. Whether developed by us or otherwise, our offering of new product features can have a significant impact on a customer's

<<<

 initial decision to choose our products. Likewise, the quality of our monitoring services, which heavily depend on the technology used in our security alarm systems, also plays a large role in our ability to attract new customers and retain

<<<

 existing customers. Accordingly, the success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services and anticipate changing customer requirements and industry standards.
We may not be able

<<<

 to develop or partner with third-party suppliers to gain access to technical advances before our competitors, match technological innovations made by our competitors or design systems that meet customers' requirements. Alternatively, we may

<<<

 not have the financial resources required to successfully develop or implement such new technologies. For example, one of the current limitations of DIY systems is that they are not yet intelligent enough to distinguish between false alarms

<<<

 and actual intrusions. However, the technology used in such systems could improve and increase the level of competition. Alternatively, technological improvements in distinct but related industries could also increase levels of competition

<<<

. For example, Microsoft recently announced the launch of a start up accelerator focused on the next wave of home automation projects, which could, among other things, improve technology related to DIY systems' abilities to distinguish between

<<<

 false alarms and actual intrusions. If we are unable, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt to changing market conditions or customer requirements in a timely manner, we could lose existing customers, encounter trouble

<<<

 recruiting new customers, or become subject to increased pricing pressures. Should we experience any of these technology related challenges, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

<<<

.
We are susceptible to economic downturns, particularly those impacting the housing market or consumer spending.
Our financial performance depends primarily on residential consumers in single-family dwellings and, to a lesser extent, on small

<<<

 businesses. Periods of economic downturn, particularly those impacting the housing market or consumer discretionary spending, can increase our cancellation rates among existing customers. For example, customer cancellation rates increased across

<<<

 our business in 2009 compared to 2008, which coincided with the global economic crisis. In the residential segment, a proportion of customers discontinued our service in order to reduce their recurring costs, while others moved from their homes

<<<

 and did not re-subscribe to our service. In the small business segment, customers were particularly impacted by the economic downturn and sought to reduce their costs or were forced to close their businesses, and thus we had a more significant

<<<

 increase in cancellation rates in our small business portfolio compared to our residential customers. Cancellations as a percentage of overall customers increased in both 2012 and 2013, which was primarily driven by enduring effects of the

<<<

 recession in the Spanish market, where we have a larger proportion of small business customers compared to other markets. Small business subscriptions are more directly correlated to economic conditions. A renewed or future recession or period

<<<

 of economic uncertainty could lead to resumed increases in our cancellation rate and could reduce the inflow of new customers purchasing our products. Periods of economic downturn, particularly those that affect Europe, can also negatively

<<<

 impact our ability to sell new alarm systems. The outlook for the world economy remains uncertain. General market volatility has resulted from uncertainty about sovereign debt and fear of further downgrading of or defaults on sovereign debt

<<<

, in particular in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Any change in economic conditions in our markets that negatively impacts our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations

<<<

.

LO\5912661.4

Attrition of customer accounts or failure to continue to acquire new customers in a cost effective manner could adversely affect our operations.
We do not require our customers to enter into long-term contracts with punitive

<<<

 cancellation clauses. Thus, after any contractual notice period (typically one to three months), a customer may cancel a subscription without penalty. For residential customers, the main reasons for cancelling a subscription include factors

<<<

 such as moving to a new home, financial distress or dissatisfaction with our customer service or prices. For small businesses, cancellations are usually related to financial distress, the failure, closure or relocation of the business or dissatisfaction

<<<

 with our customer service or prices. Our cancellation rates on a twelve-month trailing basis were 6.8%, 7.3%, 9.4%, and 8.9% in the period ended June 30, 2015, and the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As we continue

<<<

 to expand, including into new markets, our new customers may have different economic and other characteristics from our current customers, which may lead to increased cancellation rates. For example, in Brazil and other countries in which we

<<<

 have recently commenced operations, the cancellation rates were higher than we typically experience on average in the geographies where we are more established.
Customer cancellations reduce our revenues from monthly subscription fees and,

<<<

 to the extent we decide to invest in replacing such customer cancellations with new customer contracts, such customer cancellations also increase our capital investment costs. Consequently, customer cancellations, particularly prior to the

<<<

 end of the payback period (the time it takes to recapture our upfront costs) have a negative effect on our business. If upfront capital investment costs increase, or if the installation fees or monthly subscription fees we charge decrease,

<<<

 the payback period will lengthen, only serving to increase the negative effects that any cancellations may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to retain existing customers and acquire new customers

<<<

 in a cost effective manner may also be effected by our customers' selection of telecommunications services. Certain elements of our operating model rely on our customers' selection of telecommunications services (both wireless and wired), which

<<<

 we use to communicate with our monitoring operations. In order to continue to service our customers, our systems need to be able to interface with the technology existing in our customers' residences or businesses. Advances in technology may

<<<

 require customers to upgrade to alternative, and often more expensive, technologies to transmit alarm signals. Such higher costs may reduce the market for new customers, or cause existing customers to cancel their services with us. While we

<<<

 generally seek to upgrade customers on a rolling basis, if a substantial number of customers were to simultaneously seek to upgrade their services, we may not be able to efficiently or effectively accommodate such requests. Additionally, in

<<<

 the future we may not be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt existing technologies to changing market demands, and in any event we may be required to incur significant additional costs to upgrade to improved technology

<<<

. Continued shifts in technology or customers' preferences regarding telecommunications services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to offer our services to our customers

<<<

 depends on the performance of these telecommunications services. In particular, we rely on them to provide our customers' with constant connectivity to our monitoring operations so that we can be made aware of all actual intrusions. Such telecommunications

<<<

 services are, however, vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including power loss, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, these telecommunications services have the right to terminate their services under their agreements

<<<

 in certain circumstances and under certain conditions, some of which are outside our customers' control. The termination of such services could impact our ability to provide our customers' with the services they require, which would adversely

<<<

 affect the value of our business.
Our substantial concentration o f sales in Spain makes us more vulnerable to negative developments in Spain.
A significant portion of our operations occur in the Spanish market. At December 31, 2014, approximately

<<<

 41% of our customers lived in Spain, and the Spanish market accounted for 40% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. In light of this concentration, our business is particularly sensitive to developments that materially impact

<<<

 the Spanish economy or otherwise affect our operations in Spain. Negative developments in, or the general weakness of, the Spanish economy may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of potential new customers, our current customers

<<<

 and the willingness of small businesses to make investments. In particular, growth in our

LO\5912661.4

31

customer base has been affected by higher cancellations among our small business customers, which may persist due to disruptive economic

<<<

 events in Spain. We have a higher percentage of small business customers in Spain than in our other markets and such small business customers tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions. A recession, or public perception that economic

<<<

 conditions are deteriorating, could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business. While the impact of a continued economic slowdown or recession on our business in Spain is uncertain, it could result

<<<

 in a decline in our revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Certain of our potential competitors may seek to expand their market share by bundling their existing offerings

<<<

 with additional products and services.
We may not be able to compete effectively with companies that integrate or bundle security offerings similar to ours with the other general services they provide. For example, home insurance companies

<<<

 (many of which offer reduced premiums for homes with security alarms) and telecommunications or utility companies (both of which may already have a relationship with our potential customers) may decide to expand into alarm monitoring services

<<<

 and bundle their existing offerings with monitored security services. The existing access to and relationship with customers that these companies have could give them a substantial advantage over us, especially if they are able to offer customers

<<<

 a lower price by bundling these services. These potential competitors may subject us to pricing pressure, slower growth in our customer base, higher costs and increased cancellation rates among our customers. If we are unable to sufficiently

<<<

 respond to these competitors or otherwise meet these competitive challenges, we may lose customers or experience a decrease in demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition

<<<

 and results of operations.
In addition, in many locations, we work with guarding companies to respond to triggered alarms. If the guarding companies were to successfully expand into the alarm monitoring and installation market, they would become

<<<

 direct competitors with us. This development would also force us to have to find alternative first responders in the affected regions, and such alternative first responders may not be available on a timely basis or on commercially attractive

<<<

 terms. The costs and difficulties associated with finding alternative providers, as well as any decrease in our market share in the relevant region, resulting from the presence of these new entrants, could have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Privacy concerns, such as consumer identity theft and security breaches, could hurt our reputation and revenues.
As part of our operations, we collect a large amount of private information

<<<

 from our customers, including credit card information, images, voice recordings and other personal data. If we were to experience a breach of our data security, we might find ourselves in a position where private information about our customers

<<<

 was at risk of exposure. To the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft, or the misuse or distribution of other personal data, including imagery taken by our surveillance equipment, we may experience a general

<<<

 decline in consumer confidence in our business, which may lead to an increase in our cancellation rate or make it more difficult to attract new customers. In the past, when concerns were raised regarding data integrity, we proactively requested

<<<

 that customers change their passwords. However, if we are unable to identify such potential threats prior to a breach of our systems, customers may lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information. If consumers become reluctant

<<<

 to use our services because of concerns over data privacy or credit card fraud, our ability to generate revenues would be impaired. In addition, if technology upgrades or other expenditures are required to prevent security breaches of our network

<<<

, boost general consumer confidence in our business, or prevent credit card fraud and identity theft, we may be required to make unplanned capital expenditures or expend other resources. Further, as we expand the automation of our services and

<<<

 offer increasingly centralized access for consumers through features like "Connected Home," the potential risk associated with any form of cyberattack or data breach also increases, threatening to expose consumer data. Any such breach and associated

<<<

 loss of confidence in our business or additional capital expenditure requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, in certain of our markets, the processing of personal

<<<

 data is subject to governmental regulation and legislation. Any failure to comply with such regulations or legislation could lead to

LO\5912661.4

32

governmental sanctions, including fines or the initiation of criminal or civil proceedings

<<<

. For example, the Spanish Data Protection Authority has commenced an investigation into our handling of customer data, which could result in fines. Additionally, in Portugal and Spain, our customers and employees have the right to access, rectify

<<<

, cancel or oppose the processing of their personal data. If we fail to comply with any regulations or legislation applicable to our collection and processing of personal data, we may be exposed to judicial proceedings or fines, any of which

<<<

 could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Potential competition with our former parent or disputes over our primary brand name may negatively impact our results of operations.
We do

<<<

 not own the "SECURITAS" brand name or trademark. Instead, we license the "SECURITAS" brand name and trademark from Securitas AB for most of our operating geographic locations. Securitas AB is our former parent company from whom we demerged

<<<

 in 2006. Historically, Securitas AB has primarily focused on the large enterprise segment of the security market, as opposed to the residential and small business market in which we operate. However, in the future, Securitas AB may choose to

<<<

 compete directly against us, including using a form of the "SECURITAS" brand name in the markets in which we operate. In that case, consumers may become confused between our brand and their brand. Additionally, consumers may prefer the products

<<<

 or services that Securitas AB would offer over our products or services.
Our current license for the use of the "SECURITAS" brand name and trademark expires in December 2029. After that date, we may not be able to continue to license the "SECURITAS

<<<

" brand on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Additionally, in accordance with the agreements granting our license, Securitas AB may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including if we are acquired by or enter into a

<<<

 joint venture with a competitor of Securitas AB. Our license does not provide exclusive use of the "SECURITAS" brand name or trademark even in the countries where we have operations. As a result, there could be significant brand confusion in

<<<

 markets where Securitas AB or its sub-licensees use the same trademark to sell alarm systems or provide other security services. Any resulting brand confusion among our customers could harm our reputation or reduce the value of our brand. For

<<<

 example, Securitas AB currently competes with us in Spain, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway and France, under the name "SECURITAS ALERT SERVICES." The license does not extend beyond our current countries of operation in Europe

<<<

, and we operate under the name "Verisure" in Latin America. We would have to obtain the consent of Securitas AB to use the "SECURITAS" brand name in any other country in which we choose to commence operations if we would like to operate under

<<<

 that brand. Additionally, the license stipulates that the "SECURITAS" brand name may not be used alongside or in combination with other trademarks or business names without consent from Securitas AB. Securitas AB is under no obligation to grant

<<<

 consent of such use. Breaches under this license would allow Securitas AB to bring legal action against us for unauthorized use of its intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and

<<<

 results of operations. We currently use the "SECURITAS" brand name alongside and in combination with "VERISURE" and other trademarks in certain countries.
We have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in connection with developing

<<<

 our brands.
We make significant expenditures to market our brands and increase brand awareness among consumers. In addition, from time to time we seek to develop new brands, and often make significant investments to develop these brands. Since

<<<

 2009, we have developed our "Verisure" brand for use with our premium products. As we continue to build the "Verisure" brand name, there is some risk that the volume of new installations and our cancellation rate could be adversely impacted

<<<

, as potential customers and existing customers may not associate this new brand name with our historical reputation as a quality service provider. We may not be successful in achieving an acceptable level of recognition for our brands and,

<<<

 if so, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We regard our brand names as critical to our success. Failure to protect our brand names or to prevent unauthorized use by third

<<<

 parties, or termination of the agreements granting our license, could harm our reputation, affect the ability of customers to associate our quality service with our company and cause us substantial difficulty in soliciting new customers, which

<<<

 could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

LO\5912661.4

33

We may face difficulties in increasing our customer base or our subscription fees or up-selling new products to our current

<<<

 customers, and these difficulties may cause our operating results to suffer.
We have experienced strong revenue growth recently. However, our future rate of growth may slow compared to the last several years. Our recent revenue growth is primarily

<<<

 due to the growth of our customer base and increases in our subscription fees (including certain increases beyond the increase in consumer price indices). We may not be able to sustain the level of customer growth, and further increases in

<<<

 subscription fees may meet customer resistance and lead to increases in customer cancellation rates. If we are unable to execute our business strategy, the RHSB market does not continue to grow as we expect, or we encounter other unforeseen

<<<

 difficulties in acquiring new customers or selling additional products and services to existing customers, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, we may be forced

<<<

 to spend additional capital to continue to acquire customers at our present rate or, during certain periods in the future, we may seek to increase the rate at which we acquire additional customers. Either such strategy would cause us to expend

<<<

 additional amounts to purchase inventory and to market our products. As a result of these increased investments, our profitability would decrease. In addition, we may evaluate complementary business opportunities, adding customer acquisition

<<<

 channels and forming new alliances with partners to market our alarm systems. Any of these new opportunities, customer acquisition channels or alliances could have higher cost structures than our current arrangements, which could reduce profit

<<<

 margins. Moreover, our customer base includes long-time legacy customers, and it is a challenge to sell additional services to such customers. Should we increase our efforts to up-sell new products and incur the additional costs, our business

<<<

, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risk which may adversely affect our earnings, and we may not be able to successfully implement

<<<

 our comprehensive cost savings program, FOG.
We are subject to increasing operating costs. We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs. While we aim to increase our subscription

<<<

 rates to offset increases in operating costs, we may not be successful in doing so. Price increases are also associated with expenses, in particular, service costs. As a result, our operating costs may increase faster than our associated revenues

<<<

, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We recently launched our FOG program with a goal of reducing our costs and improving productivity. Although we expect to benefit from substantial

<<<

 cost savings and efficiencies in the years ahead, there can be no guarantee that such benefits will be realized or that additional costs will not be incurred. The success of the program is contingent on many factors, including the implementation

<<<

 of initiatives in daily operations, follow-ups by management, effective leverage of successful strategies across jurisdictions, assumptions regarding local and macroeconomic conditions, engagement with third parties (including contract counter

<<<

 parties), timely launch of various requests for proposals, foreign exchange rates, successful training with respect to customer care efficiency initiatives and effective rollout of automation of various systems some of which may not materialize

<<<

 in accordance with our expectations.
If the planned measures to increase efficiency and achieve cost savings fail in whole or in part or are not sustainable, we may not operate profitably or may experience less profitably than we expect to

<<<

. All of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
An increase in labor costs in the jurisdictions in which we operate, especially in Spain, may adverselyaffectourbusiness

<<<

 andprofitability.
Our business is labor intensive, with labor costs representing 34% of our total operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2014. Any increase in labor costs, particularly in Spain where 42% of our employees are located

<<<

, could adversely affect our business and profitability. Most of our employees work under collective bargaining agreements. These existing collective bargaining agreements may not be able to be extended or renewed on their current terms, and

<<<

 we may be unable to negotiate collective bargaining agreements in a favorable and timely manner. We may also become subject to

LO\5912661.4

34

additional collective bargaining agreements in the future or our non-unionized workers may unionize

<<<

, any of which may could have a material adverse effect on our costs, operations and business. Additionally, in certain circumstances we may have to pay severance or other payments to those who we work with in our partner model. In the event

<<<

 that we experience a significant or material increase in labor costs and are not able to pass some or all of those costs on to our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations

<<<

.
Any significant or prolonged disruption o f our monitoring centers could constrain our ability to effectively respond to alarms and serve our customers.
A disruption to one or more of our monitoring centers could constrain our ability to provide

<<<

 alarm monitoring services and serve our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our alarm systems are linked to our monitoring centers by a variety of connection platforms (both wired and wireless). It is critical

<<<

 that the communication platforms supporting our monitoring activities function properly and allow us to provide our full range of security solutions. We are exposed to various risks ranging from outages and interruptions in the connections

<<<

 between our alarms and our monitoring centers as well as larger-scale power failures or other catastrophes with respect to our monitoring centers. In addition, because our customer service operators are often in the same location as our monitoring

<<<

 staff, damage or a protracted outage in telecommunication traffic in a specific area or a wide range of areas that affect more than one of our monitoring stations could significantly disrupt our sales and monitoring operations. For example

<<<

, if any of our monitoring centers were to be affected by earthquake, flood, fire or other natural disaster, act of terrorism, cyber-attack, power loss or other catastrophe, our operations and customer relations could be, in turn, materially

<<<

 and adversely affected. We attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining auxiliary facilities that can support full monitoring capabilities. Nevertheless, such facilities may not remain operational or we may not be able to transfer our monitoring

<<<

 function in a timely manner. In addition, an auxiliary facility typically does not have all the same capabilities and functionalities as the main center, such as invoicing. Any significant disruption to our operations could have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our reputation as a supplier and service provider of high quality security offerings may be adversely affected by product defects or shortfalls in our customer service

<<<

.
Our business depends on our reputation and our ability to maintain good relationships with our customers, suppliers, employees and local regulators. Our reputation may be harmed either through product defects, such as the failure of one or

<<<

 more of our alarm systems, or shortfalls in our customer service, such as a failure to provide reliable product maintenance. Any harm done to our reputation or business relationships as a result of our actions or the actions of third parties

<<<

 could have a significant negative effect on us. Our relationships with our customers are of particular importance. Customers generally judge our performance through their interactions with the staff at our monitoring centers, the reliability

<<<

 of our products and our maintenance performance for any products that require repair. Any failure to meet our customers' expectations in such customer service areas could have a material impact on our cancellation rates or make it difficult

<<<

 to recruit new customers. Moreover, we may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that any of our products is alleged to contain a defect and we may incur liability costs for the entire damage or loss claimed. Any claims could

<<<

 divert resources from operating the business and may adversely affect our reputation with our customers as a provider of quality solutions. Any harm to our reputation caused by any of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may face liability or damage to our reputation or brand for our failure to respond adequately to alarm activations.
The nature of the services we provide potentially exposes

<<<

 us to risks of liability for operational failures. If we fail to respond effectively to an alarm, our customers could be harmed, their items could be stolen or their property could be damaged. Our alarm monitoring agreements and other agreements

<<<

 pursuant to which we sell our products and services typically contain provisions limiting our liability to customers and third parties in the event that certain failures lead to a loss due to a system failure or an inadequate response to alarm

<<<

 activation. However, these provisions as well as our insurance policies may be inadequate to protect us from potential liability. In addition, if a claim is brought against us, these limitations may not be enforced or enforceable. Any significant

<<<

 or material claim related to the failure of our products or services could lead to significant litigation costs, including the payment of

LO\5912661.4

35

monetary damages, reputational damage and adverse publicity, which could have an adverse

<<<

 effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business operates in a regulated industry, and noncompliance with regulations could expose us to fines, penalties and other liabilities and negative consequences.
Our

<<<

 operations and employees are subject to various laws and regulations. We are subject to EU and local laws, rules and regulations in the geographic regions in which we operate. These regulations govern our operations, from the sales and installation

<<<

 process through to the monitoring and alarm verification process. Many European countries have regulations governing consumer sales methods such as door-to-door, telemarketing and online sales, as well as regulations governing trial periods

<<<

 during which customers may request a refund if they change their mind about wanting to purchase a given product or service. In order to install an alarm system, we generally must be licensed in the country where we are installing the system

<<<

. Additionally, we generally must obtain operating certificates or permits for our monitoring centers, and provide certain levels of training to our employees at those centers. We are also governed by regulations relating to when we can forward

<<<

 alarms to emergency providers, and are subject to certain consequences if we forward false alarms to such emergency providers. Any failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations (local or otherwise) in which we operate may result in

<<<

 fines, penalties or a suspension or termination of our right to sell, install and monitor alarm systems in the relevant jurisdiction.
Additionally, changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or the introduction

<<<

 of EU regulation could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses to comply with such laws or regulations, or become unable to operate in the alarm sale, installation or monitoring market within the localities in which such laws or regulations

<<<

 are implemented. Such changes may also result in delays in commencement or completion of services for our customers or the need to modify completed installations. Any limitation on our ability to operate our business due to legal or regulatory

<<<

 reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Increased adoption o f false alarm ordinances by local governments or other similar regulatory developments could adversely affect

<<<

 our business.
An increasing number of local governmental authorities have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws, regulations or policies aimed at reducing the perceived costs to them of responding to false alarm signals. These measures

<<<

 could include, among other things:
 requiring permits for the installation and operation of individual alarm systems and the revocation of such permits following a specified number of false alarms;
 imposing limitations on the number of times

<<<

 the police will respond to alarms at a particular location after a specified number of false alarms;
 requiring further verification of an alarm signal before the police will respond; and
 subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or

<<<

 penalties for transmitting false alarms.
Enactment of such measures could adversely affect our costs and our ability to conduct our activities. For example, concern over false alarms in localities adopting these ordinances could cause a decrease

<<<

 in the timeliness of emergency responders. As a result, consumers may be discouraged from purchasing or maintaining an alarm monitoring system. In addition, some local governments impose assessments, fines, penalties and limitations on either

<<<

 customers or the alarm companies for false alarms. Our alarm service contracts generally allow us to pass these charges on to customers. However, if more local governments impose assessments, fines or penalties, or if local governments increase

<<<

 existing requirements, our customers may find these additional charges prohibitive and be discouraged from using alarm monitoring services. If the adoption of such ordinances reduces the demand for our products or services or if we are unable

<<<

 to pass related assessments, fines and penalties on to our customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

LO\5912661.4

We rely on third-party suppliers for our

<<<

 alarm systems and any failure or interruption in the provision of such products or failure by us to meet minimum purchase requirements could harm our ability to operate our business.
The alarm systems and other products that we install are

<<<

 manufactured by third party suppliers. Our suppliers' abilities to meet our needs are subject to various risks, including political and economic stability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues

<<<

. We are therefore susceptible to the interruption of supply or the receipt of faulty products from our suppliers. Difficulties encountered with suppliers may result in disruptions to our operations, loss of profitability and damage to our reputation

<<<

, and in such instances our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. For example, if suppliers for key components fail to deliver products or experience delays in delivery, such difficulties

<<<

 may prevent us from upgrading equipment, delivering products to our customer on time, or otherwise hinder our ability to install and upgrade systems and provide replacement parts. This could result in higher costs to us and a potential decline

<<<

 in confidence in our products and services among our customers. We are particularly vulnerable to any disruptions in supply of our legacy systems or replacement parts for these systems, as these products may become obsolete and may be out of

<<<

 production. In Spain and southern Europe, we rely on a single supplier to supply us with all our new alarm systems, which subjects us to a higher risk of interrupted supply. We also must meet minimum purchase commitments with certain suppliers

<<<

, which may require us to hold inventory in excess of our requirements. For example, in 2008, as the economy slowed significantly, so did the demand for our products and we were required to purchase and hold excess inventory to meet our minimum

<<<

 purchase requirements.
We also often partner with key suppliers to develop proprietary technologies and products used in our business. We use these partnerships to supplement our own internal product development team. If these suppliers fail

<<<

 to keep pace with technological innovations in the RHSB market, we may incur increased product development costs or lose customers to competitors with access to these technological innovations. Any interruption in supply, failure to produce

<<<

 quality products or inability to keep pace with technological innovation by a key supplier could adversely affect our operations, as it may be difficult for us to find alternatives on terms acceptable to us, which could have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may incur unexpectedly high costs as a result o f meeting our warranty obligations.
Many of our customer agreements provide for warranties with longer coverage periods

<<<

 than the warranties offered to us from suppliers of our component parts. Therefore, we may be liable for defects in our suppliers' component parts that manifest after the term of the manufacturer's warranty expires. Further, our suppliers'

<<<

 warranties also have limitations on the extent of their liability for repairs or replacements. Additionally, we may encounter situations where we believe a product is defective, but the manufacturer may not honor the warranty either because

<<<

 they do not agree that the product is defective or because the manufacturer has financial difficulties. Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of our estimates for which we are unable to receive reimbursement from the supplier

<<<

 could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our insurance policies may not fully protect us from significant liabilities.
We carry insurance of various types, including claims, general

<<<

 liability and professional liability insurance, in amounts management considers adequate and customary for our industry. Some of our insurance policies, and the laws of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, may limit or prohibit insurance

<<<

 coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages, or liability arising from gross negligence. As such, our insurance policies may be inadequate to protect us against liability from the hazards and risks related to our business. Additionally

<<<

, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance, or an event that we did not carry adequate insurance for, could result in substantial

<<<

 losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Unauthorized use of or disputes involving our proprietary technology and processes may adversely affect our business.
Our success

<<<

 and competitive position depends in part on a combination of trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We use our in-house development team to design proprietary products,

LO\5912661.4

37

including hardware and software protocols. We also

<<<

 cooperate with our network of manufacturing partners to jointly develop new proprietary products and solutions. In general, we have not sought or received patents covering such proprietary technologies and therefore the legal protections covering

<<<

 our proprietary technologies from infringement or other misuse may be inadequate. Likewise, the remedy for any breach of such protections may not be adequate to compensate us for the damages suffered. Any access to or use by competitors of

<<<

 our technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, we may be subject to claims of patent or other intellectual property rights infringement by third parties. In developing

<<<

 technologies and systems, we may not adequately identify third-party intellectual property rights or assess the scope and validity of these third-party rights. Accordingly, we may become subject to lawsuits alleging that we have infringed on

<<<

 the intellectual property rights of others and seeking that we cease to use the relevant technology. Intellectual property litigation could adversely affect the development or sale of the challenged product or technology or require us to pay

<<<

 damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any such intellectual property litigation could represent a significant expense and divert

<<<

 our personnel's attention and efforts and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be unable to effectively manage our growth into new markets or realize the intended benefits

<<<

 from our acquisitions.
Our growth plan includes expansion into new markets, particularly in Latin America. Expanding into these new markets involves significant expenditures on development of monitoring and backup centers, hiring and training

<<<

 of personnel, and marketing efforts to introduce our brand to the new market. We may not accurately predict such costs or accurately anticipate operational difficulties caused by local market conditions, and therefore may not achieve our financial

<<<

 and strategic objectives for our operations in the new markets. Accordingly, we may incur losses as we expand our operations. Some examples of the risks encountered in entering new markets include:
 costs associated with signing up customers

<<<

 who may not prove as loyal as our current customer base, which would cause our cancellation rate to increase;
 increased investment associated with understanding new markets and following trends in these markets in order to effectively compete

<<<

;
 increased costs associated with adapting our products and services to different requirements in the local markets, which may decrease our margins and profitability;
 challenges relating to developing appropriate risk management and internal

<<<

 control structures for operations in new markets and understanding and complying with new regulatory schemes;
 reduced ability to predict our performance because we will have less experience in the new markets than in our existing markets

<<<

;
 trade barriers such as export requirements, which could cause us to experience inventory shortages or an inability to offer our full set of products;
 tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of

<<<

 our products and make us less competitive in some countries;
 currency effects, such as future currency devaluations; and
 political, regulatory and other local risks.
When we enter into acquisitions, such as the purchase of TeleAtlantic

<<<

 in the third quarter of 2014, we expect such acquisitions will result in various benefits. However, achieving the anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the business we acquire can be operated in the

<<<

 manner in which we intend. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits and synergies could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of revenues generated by the combined business and diversion of management's time and energy. In

<<<

 addition, in connection with any acquisitions, we cannot exclude that, in spite of the due diligence we perform, we will not inadvertently or unknowingly acquire actual or potential liabilities or defects, including legal claims, claims for

<<<

 breach of contract, employment-related claims, environmental liabilities, conditions or damage, hazardous materials or

LO\5912661.4

38

liability for hazardous materials or tax liabilities. We may also become subject to national or international

<<<

 antitrust investigations in connection with any acquisitions or otherwise.
Both our failure to accurately predict or manage costs or any operational difficulties we encounter in expanding into new markets could have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as we translate our financial results into euro, and these risks would increase if individual currencies are

<<<

 reintroduced in the eurozone.
We present our consolidated financial statements in euro. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the euro into

<<<

 euro at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of certain other currencies (the Swedish Krona (SEK) and Norwegian krone (NOK) in particular) against the euro may affect the value of these items with

<<<

 respect to our non-euro businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. Our primary exposure is to the SEK and NOK. For the year ended December 31,2014, 63% of our revenue

<<<

 was denominated in euro, 20% of revenue was denominated in SEK, 11% of revenue was denominated in NOK and 6% of revenue was denominated in other currencies. Historically, the euro/SEK exchange rate fluctuated significantly, as it averaged SEK

<<<

 8.6785 = EUR 1.0 in 2013 and SEK 9.1375 = EUR 1.0 in 2014, and for the six months ended June 30, 2015, the exchange rate averaged SEK 9.3007 = EUR 1.0. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations can significantly affect the comparability of our results

<<<

 between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity. In addition, certain of our supply contracts in non-euro denominated countries contain clauses that reset

<<<

 the prices at which we buy our goods based on fluctuations in exchange rates, which can increase our costs if rates move in a manner that is unfavorable to us.
Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign currencies with costs paid

<<<

 in the same currency, our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations and any unfavorable movement in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results

<<<

 of operations.
We may suffer future impairment losses, as a result of potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
We have a significant amount of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the end of the first full financial year

<<<

 following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by computing the fair value of a cash-generating unit and comparing

<<<

 it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the cash-generating unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment is recorded. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management's fair value estimates

<<<

 are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. We cannot assure you that significant impairment charges will not be required in the future, and such charges may

<<<

 have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, as well as tax audits, which could adversely affect our financial results and condition

<<<

.
From time to time we are involved in legal and arbitration proceedings, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict. We could become involved in legal and arbitration disputes in the future which may involve substantial claims for damages

<<<

 or other payments. In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal or arbitration proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments, which could have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in 2014, we made a provision of 31.2 million in respect of a tax audit in Spain for the periods from 2008 to 2013, and it is possible that the Spanish tax authorities

<<<

 will commence an audit of additional periods as well. In addition, the costs related to litigation and arbitration proceedings may be significant. Even in case of a positive outcome in such proceedings, we may still have to bear part or all

<<<

 of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursed by the opponent, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

LO\5912661.4

39

We are dependent on our experienced

<<<

 senior management team, who may be difficult to replace.
Our success and our growth strategy depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key management, marketing, finance and operating personnel. In particular, we are dependent

<<<

 on a small group of experienced senior executives. There can be no assurance that we will continue to attract or retain the qualified personnel needed for our business. Competition for qualified senior managers, as well as research and development

<<<

 personnel, in our industry is intense and there is limited availability of persons with the requisite knowledge of our industry and the relevant experience. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could experience

<<<

 a delay or higher labor costs in order to attract and retain qualified managers and personnel from time to time. In addition, as new personnel join our management, as they did in 2014, particularly at the senior management level, we may face

<<<

 a number of challenges typically associated with the integration and assimilation of new managers and key personnel, such as changes in organizational and reporting structures, the need to recruit additional new personnel or the departure of

<<<

 existing personnel. For example, in 2014, we increased the size and responsibility of our management team. We also depend upon our "sales installer" model as a key sales strategy, which necessarily requires trained personnel. To the extent

<<<

 we are not able to retain individuals in these roles, we will incur additional costs to train new personnel to replace those who leave our business. In addition, Lars Nordmark, our current Chief Financial Officer, will be transitioning from

<<<

 the company by mutual agreement during the first quarter of 2016. We have launched a search process for a new Chief Financial Officer and anticipate a smooth transition. Our failure to recruit and retain key personnel or qualified employees

<<<

, or effectively integrate new managers and other key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re

<<<

-introduction of individual currencies within the eurozone, or the potential dissolution o f the euro entirely, could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding euro-denominated debt obligations.
Recent developments in

<<<

 the eurozone have exacerbated the ongoing global economic crisis. Financial markets and the supply of credit may continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing fears surrounding the sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries

<<<

 in Europe (primarily Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain), the possibility of further downgrading of, or defaults on, sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability

<<<

 of the euro and the sustainability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. Governments and regulators have implemented austerity programs and other remedial measures

<<<

 to respond to the eurozone debt crisis and stabilize the financial system, but the actual impact of such programs and measures are difficult to predict.
If the eurozone debt crisis is not resolved, it is possible that one or more countries

<<<

 may default on their debt obligations and/or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency or that the eurozone may collapse. If such an event were to occur, it is possible that there would be significant, extended and generalized

<<<

 market dislocation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, especially as our operations are primarily in Europe. In addition, the departure of one or more countries from the

<<<

 eurozone may lead to the imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate control laws.
For example, an anti-austerity party won the parliamentary elections in Greece on January 25, 2015 and subsequently formed a government with another anti-austerity

<<<

 party. The recent break down of negotiations between the new Greek government and its creditors has led to the closure of Greek banks and the imposition of capital controls in Greece. These events have led to Greece's default under its national

<<<

 debt and could result in its exit from the eurozone, which could, in turn, undermine confidence in the overall stability of the euro. The political unrest surrounding the crisis in Ukraine, specifically, existing or expanded economic sanctions

<<<

 imposed on Russia, and potential Russian response to those sanctions, could also have a negative impact on the European economy. As a result, we cannot predict how long these challenging conditions will exist or the extent to which the markets

<<<

 in which it operates may further deteriorate. These and other concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Member States, or, in extraordinary circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely

<<<

. These unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of customers and, as a result, it may, among others, be more (i) difficult for us to attract new customers, (ii) likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their

<<<

 services and (iii) difficult for us

LO\5912661.4

40

to maintain Average Revenue per User ("ARPU") at existing levels. Accordingly, our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, operating cash flow, operating

<<<

 cash flow margins and liquidity of our operating segments could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects

<<<

.
Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro such as supply contracts would be determined

<<<

 by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect our trading environment and the value of the Notes, and could have adverse consequences for us with

<<<

 respect to our outstanding euro-denominated debt obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
Furthermore, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Private Senior Notes Indenture and the Indenture contain or will contain covenants

<<<

 restricting our and our subsidiaries' corporate activities. See "--Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes-- We are subject to restrictive debt covenants under our financing agreements that may limit our operations and financial

<<<

 flexibility'. Certain of such covenants impose limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the amount of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur). As such, if the euro were to significantly decrease in value, the restrictions

<<<

 imposed by these covenants would become tighter, further restricting our ability to finance our operations and conduct our day-to-day business.
The interests o f our ultimate principal shareholder may be inconsistent with your interests.
Following

<<<

 the completion of the Acquisition, our ultimate principal shareholder, H&F, indirectly owns almost all of our issued and outstanding shares through funds it advises. The interests of our principal shareholder could conflict with the interests

<<<

 of investors in the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our principal shareholder could cause us to pursue acquisitions or divestitures and other transactions or to make large

<<<

 dividend payments (subject to limitations in the Indenture) or other distributions or payments to it as the shareholder, even though such transactions may involve increased risk for the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, no assurance can be

<<<

 given that our principal shareholder will not sell all or any part of its shareholding at any time nor that it will not look to reduce its holding by means of a sale to a strategic investor, an equity offering or otherwise. Such divestitures

<<<

 may not trigger a "Change of Control" under the Indenture.
Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes
The Issuer and certain o f the Guarantors are holding companies with no operations of their own.
The Issuer and certain of

<<<

 the Guarantors are holding companies with no independent business operations and no significant assets, other than the equity interests each of the companies holds in its subsidiaries. Each of these holding companies will be dependent upon

<<<

 the cash flow from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees, respectively. The amounts of dividends and distributions

<<<

 available to each holding company will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to issue dividends to it under applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer and these Guarantors, however

<<<

, may not be permitted to make distributions, move cash or advance upstream loans to the Issuer or other Guarantors to make payments in respect of their respective indebtedness, including the Notes and the Guarantees. Various regulations and

<<<

 agreements governing certain of our subsidiaries may restrict, and in some cases, actually prohibit the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash to the Issuer or the Guarantors. Applicable laws and regulations including tax laws may also

<<<

 limit the amounts that the subsidiaries of the Issuer or such Guarantors are permitted to pay as dividends or distributions. Any restrictions on distributions by such subsidiaries could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer or such Guarantor

<<<

 to make payment on the Notes or the Guarantees, as applicable. In addition, financial assistance or corporate benefit restrictions may prevent upstream loans being made to the Issuer or such Guarantors by their respective subsidiaries to enable

<<<

 the Issuer or such Guarantors to service their respective obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees. Although the Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to

<<<

 pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. Goodwill

LO\5912661.4

41

impairment and other non-cash charges in our combined special purpose profit or loss

<<<

 account, as well as charges recognized directly in equity, if incurred, could potentially reduce the Issuer's subsidiaries' reserves available for distribution and thus reduce or prevent upstream dividend payments directly or indirectly to

<<<

 the Issuer.
Our substantial debt could limit our flexibility to conduct our business, adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes.
We have a substantial amount of debt and significant

<<<

 debt service obligations. As of June 30, 2015, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions and bolt on and other acquisitions, our total indebtedness would have been 2,733.8 million. In addition, we would have had 300.0 million of availability

<<<

 under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to fund capital expenditures and other expenses and to service our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. Additionally, the Private

<<<

 Senior Notes will be payable in kind for a limited number of periods and therefore the principal amount of debt payable on maturity increase accordingly. For a detailed description of our debt, please see "Description o f Notes" and "Description

<<<

 o f Certain Indebtedness."
Our substantial debt could have important negative consequences for us and you as holder of the Notes. For example, our substantial debt could:
 make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to

<<<

 the Notes and our other debt, including servicing the interest on the Private Senior Notes;
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of

<<<

 funds for business opportunities and other general corporate purposes;
 increase our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or adverse general economic or industry conditions;
 limit our flexibility in reacting adequately to changes

<<<

 in our business or the industry in which we operate;
 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt than we do; or
 limit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future and increase

<<<

 the costs of any such additional capital.
Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.
Despite our high level of indebtedness, we may

<<<

 be able to incur significant additional amounts o f debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.
We may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Indenture, the

<<<

 Private Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Debt incurred in compliance

<<<

 with these restrictions, including debt that shares in the Collateral securing the Notes on a pari passu basis, could be substantial. Incurring such additional debt could further increase the related risks we now face. In addition, the Indenture

<<<

, the Private Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.
We are subject to restrictive covenants under our financing agreements

<<<

 that limit our operating and financial flexibility.
The Indenture, the Private Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements

<<<

 limit our ability to, among other things:
 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;
 make certain restricted payments and investments;
 transfer or sell assets;

LO\5912661.4

42

 enter into transactions with affiliates;
 create or

<<<

 incur certain liens;
 make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;
 issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;
 issue or sell redeemable preferred shares;
 create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries

<<<

 to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;
 do anything that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and
 merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of

<<<

 our assets.
All of these limitations are or will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See "Description o f Notes-- Certain Covenants." The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations

<<<

 and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.
In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants and a financial

<<<

 ratio (as set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement) while certain amounts under the Senior Credit Facilities remain outstanding. See "Description o f Certain Indebtedness-- Senior Facilities Agreement." Our ability to meet that financial

<<<

 ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of those covenants, ratio or restrictions could result in an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement

<<<

. Upon the occurrence of any event of default that is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability

<<<

 of the Senior Credit Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement could

<<<

 lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Indenture and the Private Senior Notes Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors

<<<

 under the Senior Facilities Agreement, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of

<<<

 our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment

<<<

 of those amounts.
We will require a significant amount o f cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise.
Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness,

<<<

 including the Senior Credit Facilities, the Notes and the Private Senior Notes Proceeds Loan, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent

<<<

, is subject to the success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these "Risk Factors," many of which are beyond

<<<

 our control.
We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings or synergies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in

<<<

 an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then-outstanding amount under the Senior Credit Facilities. At the maturity of

<<<

 the Senior Credit Facilities (including the Revolving Credit Facility, which matures one year before the Notes), the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources

<<<

 to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness.
If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations

<<<

 as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

LO\5912661.4

43

 sell assets;
 obtain additional debt or equity capital; or
 restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before

<<<

 maturity.
The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we

<<<

 would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.
Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely

<<<

 basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture, the Private Senior Notes Indenture and

<<<

 the Senior Facilities Agreement, limit or will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous

<<<

 covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale

<<<

 and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.
The Private Senior Notes, drawings under the Senior Credit Facilities

<<<

 and any other variable interest rate debt we incur in the future will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.
The Senior Credit Facilities and Private Senior Notes

<<<

 bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR or STIBOR, as applicable, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. To the extent that interest rates or any

<<<

 drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.
Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of inter-bank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement

<<<

 agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate

<<<

 EURIBOR. Actions by EURIBOR-EBF (the association setting the regulatory framework for the calculation of EURIBOR), other regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR is determined. Any such change

<<<

, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest

<<<

.
The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool o f assets securing the Notes.
The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors

<<<

 to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture, Private Senior Notes

<<<

 Indenture or the Senior Facilities Agreement would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral

<<<

, such as selling, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral (other than with respect to the pledge over the shares of the Issuer other than in connection with an enforcement sale) and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments

<<<

 of indebtedness. To the extent these activities are allowed with regard to security interests under Swedish law such security interests could be considered to be not validly perfected. See "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity

<<<

 and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral-- Sweden-- Creation of valid securityinterests."
Holders o f the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral.
The Notes will be secured by the same Collateral securing

<<<

 our obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities, the Private Senior Notes and any future Senior Unsecured Notes (as defined in "Description of Certain Indebtedness--IntercreditorAgreement--Ranking and Priority--Priority of Debts") may also

<<<



LO\5912661.4

 additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by liens over the same Collateral.
Prior to the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date
Prior to the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date, and subject to certain limited exceptions, the

 Security Agent will act with respect to the Collateral only at the direction of a simple majority (50%) of our senior secured creditors (including, for this purpose, both drawn and undrawn uncanceled commitments under our Senior Credit Facilities

, debt in respect of certain hedging obligations and debt under the Notes). It is anticipated that, upon issuance of the Notes, the holders of the Notes will, together, hold a lower percentage of the total senior secured credit participations

<<<

 than the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities, other obligations (including hedging obligations) that may be secured by the same Collateral and, accordingly, the holders of the Notes will not initially have effective control of whether

<<<

 to enforce the Collateral.
The holders of the Notes will not have separate rights to enforce the Collateral. As a result, the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or otherwise independently

<<<

 pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents, if amounts under any other senior secured debt (including, for this purpose, both drawn and undrawn uncanceled commitments under our Senior Credit Facilities and

<<<

 debt in respect of certain hedging) remain outstanding in an amount equal to or greater than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the total senior secured credit participations.
Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors

<<<

 under our Senior Credit Facilities (and/or other secured creditors) as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any

<<<

 decision of the Instructing Group (as defined in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreem ent-Restrictions on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Senior Secured Noteholders") which may result in enforcement action in respect

<<<

 of the Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders. The creditors under our Senior Credit Facilities (and any of our other secured creditors) may have interests that are different

<<<

 from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
In addition, if the Security Agent

<<<

 sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of Holdco's subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing

<<<

 the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement," "Description of Notes--Security--Release o f Liens." In such a situation, your ability to recover on the Notes may be materially

<<<

 impaired.
On and After the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date
On and after the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date, in general, the creditor representatives representing the Senior Creditors (as defined in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness

--Intercreditor Agreement") whose senior credit participations (representing, on and after the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date, liabilities with super priority status) aggregate more than 66.67% of the total senior credit participations (being

 the Majority Senior Creditors as defined in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement--Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Note Holders") and the creditor representatives representing the Senior Secured Noteholders

 and Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties (each as defined in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement--Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Note Holders") whose pari passu credit participations aggregate more than

 50% of the total Pari Passu Credit Participations at that time (being the "Majority Pari Passu Creditors" as defined in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement--Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Note Holders

")), may provide enforcement instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in general, the instructions of the Majority Pari Passu Creditors will prevail. However, if (i) within three

<<<

 months of such Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority

45

Pari Passu Creditors have not either: (A) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue, or (B) appointed

<<<

 a Financial Adviser to assist them in making such a determination; or (ii) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either: (A) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue; or (B

<<<

) appointed a Financial Adviser to assist them in making such a determination, and in either case the Majority Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realized proceeds of enforcement and deliver enforcement instructions to the Security Agent which they reasonably believe are necessary or advisable in enhancing

<<<

 the prospects of achieving a prompt and expeditious realization of the value of the Collateral; or (iii) an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by any Enforcement Action taken by or at the request or direction of

<<<

 a Senior Lender) is continuing with respect to a Debtor; or (iv) if the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice (each as defined in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness-

<<<

- Intercreditor Agreement--Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Note Holders"), then the Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Senior Creditors until the discharge date in respect

<<<

 of the Senior Lender Liabilities has occurred.
During the period on and after the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date, the Senior Creditors (as defined in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness-- Intercreditor Agreement") shall receive proceeds

<<<

 from the enforcement of Collateral and certain distressed disposals of assets in priority to holders of the Notes and may otherwise have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes. As a result, the Senior Creditors

<<<

 may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time or in a manner that would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes.
In addition, as the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

 provides that following the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date the Security Agent may be instructed by the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (which encompasses holders of over 50% of the aggregate credit participation of the Notes and other pari

<<<

 passu debt as well as certain hedging liabilities), holders of incremental pari passu debt may have a significant influence on the outcome of such instructions under the Intercreditor Agreement and such creditors may have interests that are

<<<

 different from the interests of the holders of the Notes. See "Description o f Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement."
Upon the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations

<<<

 will be entitled to be repaid with recoveries from the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals of assets in priority to the Notes and the Guarantees.
The Notes and the Guarantees will rank pari passu with our other senior

<<<

 debt, including the Senior Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of recoveries from proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral. Such recoveries and enforcement proceeds

<<<

 are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the enforcement of the Collateral. After the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date, the Security Agent is required to pay turned over amounts and other recoveries

<<<

 by the Security Agent from enforcement actions on the Collateral and certain distressed disposals of assets to discharge the Senior Lender Liabilities and Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, as defined in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness

<<<

-- Intercreditor Agreement and being the liabilities owed to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the hedging liabilities that are permitted to be secured on the Collateral (the "Senior Liabilities"), prior to paying any such

<<<

 amounts to discharge the Notes and the Guarantees. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds

<<<

 remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral and certain distressed disposals, as defined in "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement," will, after all obligations under the Senior Liabilities have been discharged,

<<<

 be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any hedging obligations or other indebtedness secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes.

The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral

<<<

 and not all o f the Guarantors will initiallyguarantee the Notes.
On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under "Description o f Notes--Security." We will agree in the Indenture

<<<

, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, to use commercially reasonable efforts to take such necessary actions so that the Notes are secured by the security interests in the Post-Completion Collateral described in this offering memorandum

<<<

 on the earlier of (x) the date that is 90 days after the Completion Date and (y) the date on which such lien is granted in favor of the Senior Credit Facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such

<<<

 liens within the time period specified, the failure of which would result in an "event of default" under the Indenture. The Security Interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Senior Credit Facilities and otherwise as set

<<<

 forth under "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral," which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest granted by a

<<<

 Guarantor incorporated in Sweden is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose such guarantee or security interest may be subject to clawback provisions under Swedish insolvency law, see "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations

<<<

 on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral--Sweden--Challengeable transactions."
On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors. We will agree in the Indenture, subject to the Agreed

<<<

 Security Principles, to use our commercially reasonable efforts take such necessary actions so that the Post-Completion Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture (or supplemental

<<<

 indentures) in the form attached to the Indenture on the earlier of (x) the date on which such Guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and (y) 90 days following the Completion Date. In the six months ended June 30, 2

<<<

015, the Guarantors (other than Holdco) generated 97.2% of our EBITDA and 85.5% of our revenues and as of June 30, 2015, held 86.2% of our total assets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such additional Guarantees

<<<

 within the time period specified. Failure to make commercially reasonable best efforts to procure such additional Guarantees would constitute an "event of default" under the Indenture. The additional Guarantees will be limited to the same extent

<<<

 as those under the Senior Credit Facilities and otherwise as set forth under "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests."

The Notes and the Guarantees will be

<<<

 secured only to the extent o f the value o f the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.
If there

<<<

 is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured only by the Collateral. To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and other

<<<

 obligations, these claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes and the Guarantees. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral

<<<

 will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially

<<<

 less than, amounts due on the Notes.
No appraisals have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantors in connection with the issue of the Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral may be subject to fluctuations based on

<<<

 factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to

<<<

 sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral

<<<

 and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement

<<<

 action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure

<<<

 you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation.
To the extent that security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber

<<<

 assets constituting Collateral owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their security interests or other rights that could

LO\5912661.4

47

adversely

<<<

 affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts

<<<

 due on the Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant Guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer's and the Guarantors

<<<

' remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral.
Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the

<<<

 Notes, and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of creditors of those subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.
Not all of our subsidiaries will be Guarantors of the Notes. The Indenture does not limit the

<<<

 transfer of assets to, or the making of investments in, any of our restricted subsidiaries, including our restricted subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.
As payments on the Notes are only required to be made by the Issuer and the Guarantors

<<<

, no payments are required to be made from assets of subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes unless those assets are transferred by dividend or otherwise to the Issuer or one of the Guarantors. As of June 30, 2015, after giving effect to

<<<

 the Transactions, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors will have outstanding financial indebtedness in the amount of approximately 9.8 million. See "Description o f Certain Indebtedness--Local Facilities." Our non-guarantor

<<<

 subsidiaries represented 2.9% of our EBITDA and 14.5% of our revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 13.8% of our total assets as of June 30, 2015.
We may not be able to finance a change of control offer and the occurrence of certain

<<<

 important corporate events will not constitute a change o f control.
Upon a change of control, as defined in the Indenture, we are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount. Our ability to pay cash

<<<

 to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our financial resources at that time. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. We expect that we would

<<<

 require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute

<<<

 a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Credit Facilities. Please see "Description o f Notes-- Change of Control." In addition, a change of control could constitute a default under our other

<<<

 indebtedness. In addition, the occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a change of control would also require the Issuer to make a similar offer to the creditors of any indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities

<<<

. Future indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a change of control.
The change of

<<<

 control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers or other similar transactions involving us that may

<<<

 adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a "change of control" as defined in the Indenture.
The definition of "change of control

<<<

" contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase

<<<

 "all or substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition

<<<

 of "all or substantially all" of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to

<<<

 repurchase the Notes. Additionally, an enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer would constitute a "change of control."

LO\5912661.4

48

The Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on

<<<

 enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.
The Notes will be guaranteed by Holdco, which is incorporated in Sweden, and certain of our subsidiaries which

<<<

 are incorporated under the laws of Sweden, Norway, Spain, Portugal and France and secured by security interests over the Collateral, which will be governed by the laws of these jurisdictions. The Indenture will provide that the Guarantees,

<<<

 and the Indenture and the relevant Security Documents will provide that the security interests, will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or in respect of which security interests may be granted by the relevant Guarantor

<<<

 or grantor, as applicable, without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest, as it relates to that Guarantor or grantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law. See "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations

<<<

 on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral."
In addition, enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor or security interests against any security provider will be subject to certain defenses available

<<<

 to Guarantors or security providers in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer

<<<

, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance, set-off counter-claim and prescription (time bar) or similar laws, regulations or defenses

<<<

 affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or grantor of security interests may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee or security interest, as applicable

<<<

, depending on the amount of its other obligations and applicable law.
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) subordinate or void any Guarantee or any

<<<

 security interest (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor's creditors or (iii) take

<<<

 other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:
 the Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or the security provider

<<<

 or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security;
 the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration

<<<

 or reasonably equivalent value for the granting of the Guarantee and/or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest

<<<

; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;
 the granting

<<<

 of the relevant Guarantee and/or security interest was held not to be in the best interests or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security

<<<

 provider; or
 the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or enforcement proceeds under the relevant security were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.
These or similar laws may also apply

<<<

 to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered

<<<

 insolvent if:
 the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;
 the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and liabilities, including

<<<

 contingent liabilities, as they became due; or
 it could not pay its debts as they became due.

LO\5912661.4

49

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security Document, will be limited

<<<

 to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard

<<<

 a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be

<<<

 extinguished.
If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations

<<<

 under the Notes or such Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security over the collateral, or could require the holders of the relevant Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Guarantee

<<<

 or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider

<<<

 and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void.
Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor

<<<

 of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain

<<<

 events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the pledge or charge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge

<<<

 or charge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a certain time period following the pledge or charge.
The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders

<<<

 of the Notes and the concept of "trust" is not a recognized concept in certain jurisdictions.
The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees, respectively

<<<

, will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent for the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of "parallel debt" obligations in favor of the Security

<<<

 Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that only the Security

<<<

 Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee for the Notes, who

<<<

 will provide instructions to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Holders of the Notes will also bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the

<<<

 parallel debt.
There can be no assurances that such a "parallel debt" structure will be recognized and effective in all cases in all relevant jurisdictions. See "Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability o f the Guarantees and the Collateral

<<<

."
To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as parallel debt creditor under the parallel debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will

<<<

 not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.
See "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral"
There

<<<

 are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released and under which the Guarantees will be released, without your consent or the consent o f the

<<<

 Trustee.
Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released, including:
 in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the security interests in respect of shares

<<<

 of capital stock of the Issuer) to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a restricted

The value of the Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, im pairm entor certain casualty events.
The value of the properties that the Issuer and the other Guarantors own or lease serving as Collateral may be adversely

<<<

 affected by depreciation and normal wear and tear or because of certain events that may cause damage to these properties. Although the Security Documents may contain certain covenants in relation to the maintenance and preservation of assets

<<<

, the Issuer and the Guarantors will not be required to improve the Collateral.
The granting o f the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening

<<<

 periods, i.e., the periods of time following the granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.
The granting of the security interests in

<<<

 connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the granting of security interests during which such security interests

<<<

 may be challenged in accordance with the laws of Sweden, Norway, Spain, Portugal and France.
The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may create hardening periods for such security interests in each of the above

<<<

-mentioned jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture permits the release

<<<

 and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each

<<<

 new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void

<<<

 or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral."
We are relying on the Intercreditor Agreement to achieve a first

<<<

-ranking security interest in respect o f the Collateral that secures both the Notes and the Private Senior Notes.
The Notes will be and the Private Senior Notes are secured by security interests in all the shares of capital stock in the Issuer

<<<

 and in the rights of Holdco in the Private Senior Notes Proceeds Loan. Under Swedish law, these security interests will rank equally, and there are no lien subordination provisions in the relevant Security Documents. Pursuant to the terms of

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement, the liens securing such Collateral will secure obligations under the Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities on a first-ranking basis, and the Private Senior Notes on a second-ranking basis. Therefore, the ranking

<<<

 of the security interests granted in such Collateral in favor of holders of the Notes will depend on the validity and enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, if the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof

<<<

 were found to be invalid or held to be unenforceable for any reason, the holders of Notes would not benefit from such first-priority treatment and the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes and the Private Senior Notes

<<<

 would rank pari passu under Swedish law, which could reduce the potential recoveries available for the holders of the Notes in the case of an enforcement of such Collateral.
Enforcement of civil liabilities and judgments against the Issuer

<<<

 or the Guarantors or any of our directors or officers maybe difficult.
The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden, Norway, Spain, Portugal and France, and some of our assets and substantially all of our operations

<<<

 are located, and substantially all of our revenue is derived, outside the United States. In addition, all of the directors and officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of

<<<

 such persons are or may be located outside the United States. As a result, investors may be unable to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons, or to enforce judgments against them obtained in U.S. courts, including

<<<

 judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal and state securities laws. In addition, we cannot assure you that civil liabilities predicated upon the Federal securities laws of the United States will be enforceable

 in Sweden, Norway, Spain, Portugal and France. See "Enforceability o f Judgments."

Your rights as a creditor may not be as favorable under the insolvency laws of Sweden, Norway, Spain, Portugal and France as compared to

<<<

 the insolvency laws of the U.S. or otherjurisdictions and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.
The Issuer and certain Guarantors, are organized under the

<<<

 laws of Sweden, Norway, Spain, Portugal and France. Insolvency proceedings with respect to companies in each of these countries would likely be governed by local law. However, they could be required to proceed under the laws of the jurisdiction

<<<

 in which the company has its "centre of main interests," as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 663/2014 of June 5, 2014 (the "EU Insolvency

<<<

 Regulation"), at the time insolvency proceedings are commenced. Although there is a rebuttable presumption that the "centre of main interests" will be in the jurisdiction where its registered office is situated, this presumption is not conclusive

<<<

. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to these companies may proceed under, and be governed by Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish, Portuguese or French laws or potentially by the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction if the centre of

<<<

 main interests of those companies is determined to be in such other jurisdiction at the relevant time. The insolvency laws of such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as those of the United States or another jurisdiction

<<<

 with which you may be familiar. Please see "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral' for a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in Sweden, Norway, Spain

<<<

, Portugal and France.
In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency

<<<

 or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.
Guarantees and Collateral which may be provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this offering memorandum are also subject to material limitations

<<<

 pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the Guarantees or Collateral after a bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity's jurisdiction

<<<

 of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability

<<<

 to void preferential transfers, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether

<<<

 any particular jurisdiction's laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees and limit any amounts that you may receive.
Proceedings could also be initiated in jurisdictions where Collateral or

<<<

 the grantor of security interests in the Collateral are located, to enforce your rights against such Collateral or grantor. Multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater

<<<

 uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurances that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The application

<<<

 of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction's law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those jurisdictions

<<<

 or limit any amounts that you may receive.
For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Issuer, the Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral, see "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations

 on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral."
You may be required to pay a cash amount ("soulte") in the event you decide to enforce a pledge over securities granted under French law by judicial or contractual foreclosure

<<<

 o f the Collateral consisting of securities rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction.
Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Under French

<<<

 law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way

<<<

 of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of

LO\5912661.4

54

judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire

<<<

) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or

<<<

 contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed

<<<

 expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value

<<<

 of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent onsale of the Collateral.
If the value of such securities

<<<

 is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect

<<<

.
An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such

<<<

 auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined

<<<

 pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. See "Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral--France - Limitations

<<<

 on enforcement ofsecurityinterests and cash amount ("soulte")."
The approval of the French regulatory authorities may be required in order to allow the Security Agent to enforce the pledges over the shares o f a French entity.
In addition,

<<<

 in view of the area of activity of the Group or certain members of the Group, it should be noted that foreign investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain sectors (notably where their activities relate to equipment, products

<<<

 or services which are critical to the interests of France in terms of public order, public safety or national security, in particular in the areas of the provision of private security services, energy and water supply, public health, public

<<<

 transport and electronic communication) may require the prior authorization of the French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a business.
Where any of the above sectors

<<<

 are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments which are subject to the prior authorization procedure:
 A transaction as a result of which a non-EU investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-

<<<

3 of the French Commercial Code), (ii) acquires all or part of a business (branche d 'activite) or (iii) crosses the threshold of 33.33 percent of the share capital, in each case of a company whose registered office is located in France.
 A

<<<

 transaction as a result of which an EU investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a business, in either case of a company whose registered office

<<<

 is located in France.
 A transaction as a result of which a French investor under non-French control acquires all or part of a business of a company whose registered office is located in France.
When a foreign investment is subject to the

<<<

 authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction cannot be completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior authorization to the French authorities which must render a decision

<<<

 within two months of receipt of a filing which is deemed complete by the French authorities (failing which authorization shall be deemed to have been granted).
We can provide no assurance that the approval of the French authorities would not

<<<

 be required in order to allow the Security Agent to enforce the pledge over the shares of a French entity or that such approval, if required, would be granted.

An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, in which

<<<

 case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.
We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes or the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.
Future trading prices for

<<<

 the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions

<<<

 that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to

<<<

 disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions

<<<

. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active

<<<

 trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.
Although an application has been made to admit the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted to

<<<

 trading on the Euro MTF Market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no assurances is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF Market, failure to be approved

<<<

 for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a holder's ability to resell

<<<

 the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.
One or more independent credit

<<<

 rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under

<<<

 the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation

<<<

 to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating

<<<

 will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of

<<<

 the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.
Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes.
The Notes

<<<

 will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchangerelated risks due to, among other factors, possible

<<<

 significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control

<<<

. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss

<<<

 to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. holders

<<<

 (as defined in "Tax Considerations-- U.S. Federal Income Taxation") may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See "Tax Considerations-- U.S. Federal Income Taxation."
Additionally, pro

<<<

 forma for the Transactions, certain of our indebtedness will be denominated in SEK. While we will initially draw these funds in the euro equivalent, set to a pre-agreed exchange rate, the principal amount of the indebtedness will remain outstanding

<<<

 in SEK. To the extent the SEK/euro exchange rate varies, the euro equivalent amount due upon repayment of principal could increase. We

LO\5912661.4

56

do not presently intend to hedge our SEK exposure as a portion of our revenues are denominated

<<<

 in SEK.
The transferability o f the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws.
The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other

<<<

 jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable securities

<<<

 laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. The Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to "qualified institutional buyers" in accordance with Rule 144A. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the

<<<

 Notes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (including by way of an exchange offer). Please see "Transfer Restrictions." It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within the United

<<<

 States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.
The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures o f the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.
Unless

<<<

 and until definitive Notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the Notes (which will only occur in very limited circumstances), owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common

<<<

 depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of any Global Notes. After payment to the common depositary, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest

<<<

, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream

<<<

, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the Indenture.
Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct

<<<

 right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies

<<<

 to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis

<<<

.
Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through

<<<

 Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes
Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and

 other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability ofthe Guarantees ofthe Notes.
Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against a Guarantor will be subject to certain laws applicable, and defenses

<<<

 the Existing Notes, as if the Transactions occurred on the Issue Date. Adjusting for the Transactions only, as at June 30, 2015, cash on balance sheet would be 58.3 million. We also expect to use cash on balance sheet to pay for the interest

<<<

 that accrues on the Senior Secured Bridge Facility between the Completion Date and the Issue Date.
(2) Long-term debt is reflected at its aggregate principal amounts plus capitalized interest as o f June 30, 2015, if applicable, and does not

<<<

 reflect capitalized debt issuance costs or accrued interest expense.
(3) The Existing Revolving Credit Facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to approximately 299.3 million. As of June 30, 2015, we had 102.9 million outstanding under

<<<

 Date, there was a total of 140.0 million outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. The Existing Revolving Credit Facility was repaid in full as part of the Transactions on the Completion Date.
(4) In connection with the Transactions

<<<

, the indenture under which the Existing Notes were issued has been satisfied and discharged on the Completion Date via irrevocable deposit of the applicable redemption premia and accrued and unpaid interest to the expected redemption dates

<<<

.
(5) Reflects the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Mezzanine Loan and includes 13.4 million in capitalized interest as of June 30, 2015. The Mezzanine Loan was repaid in full as part of the Transactions on the Completion Date

<<<

(6) In connection with the Mediaveil Acquisition, which occurred subsequent to June 30, 2015, we assumed an additional 8.1 million in Local Facilities, which will remain outstanding upon completion of the Transactions.

<<<

 Since June 30, 2015, we have also made additional drawings under other facilities such that, as of September 30, 2015, total obligations under our Local Facilities were 36.8 million (equivalent), including facilities related to Mediaveil.


<<<

(7) The proceeds of the Offering of the Notes, together with cash on balance sheet, will be used to repay the Senior Secured Bridge Facility in full on the Issue Date.
(8) The Senior Term Loan is denominated in both euro and SEK and was drawn

<<<

 in full on completion of the Acquisition in an amount of 1,300 million (equivalent).
(9) The proceeds of the Private Senior Notes issued by Cayman 1 and subsequently assumed by Holdco were on-lent to the Issuer via the Private Senior Notes

<<<

 Proceeds Loan, which is a subordinated debt obligation of the Issuer. The Private Senior Notes Proceeds Loan is denominated in SEK and euro in an amount equivalent to 700.0 million (equivalent).
(10) The Revolving Credit Facility provides for

<<<

 aggregate borrowings of up to 300 million (equivalent). No cash drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility were made on the Completion Date and no drawings are intended to be outstanding on the Issue Date.
(11) Represents amounts loaned from

<<<

 Holdco to the Issuer. The Shareholder Loan was capitalized as part of the Transactions.
(12) Reflects the outstanding Shareholder Funding Instruments of the Issuer as of June 30, 2015. The Shareholding Funding Instruments of the Issuer were

<<<

 repaid in full as part of the Transactions on the Completion Date.
(13) Adjustments to total equity reflect the impact of non-capitalized costs incurred in relation to the Transactions, including unamortized fees on the Existing Securitas Indebtedness

<<<

 and a payment to Holdco, offset by the capitalization of the Shareholder Loan. No tax effects or deferred tax effects with respect to applicable items related to changes in equity in connection with the Transactions have been included in these

<<<

 adjustments.

A significant majority of the costs incurred in

<<<

 our Portfolio Services segment are variable or semi-fixed and primarily include labor costs associated with our monitoring and customer service activities (such as monitoring center operators and field technicians). At the same time a portion

<<<

 of our costs are fixed (such as rental costs with respect to our monitoring centers), which, together with the semi-fixed costs, provide a degree of operating leverage as the customer base grows. The capital expenditures for Portfolio Services

<<<

 are generally low and primarily consist of the purchase of upgraded customer equipment and computer servers and other hardware and software at our monitoring centers. As a result, we are able to improve our operating margins and cash flow as

<<<

 we add new customers to our existing operations. For example, from January 1,2012 to June 30, 2015 we increased our number of customers from 1.4 million to 1.9 million and increased our Adjusted EBITDA margin from Portfolio Services from 5

<<<

3.2% in 2012 to 60.5% in the quarter ended June 30, 2015, annualized.
We apply and replicate best in class practices across our footprint and invest in tools and processes to ensure improvements in our operations. As a result of our size, we

<<<

 believe we are able to benefit from synergies and economies of scale while maintaining a culture of day-to-day cost discipline.
To monitor performance within our Portfolio Services segment, our management focuses on a number of key metrics

<<<

 including Average Revenue per User ("ARPU"), Monthly EBITDA per Customer ("EPC") and Cancellation Rate. These metrics are described in more detail under "--Key Operating Metrics." We also measure and evaluate our service performance through

<<<

 a number of operational metrics. We believe our customer service and support function is a key reason for the maintenance of high retention rates in our customer base.
Customer Acquisition
Our Customer Acquisition segment develops, sources

<<<

, purchases, sells and installs our alarm systems for new customers in return for an upfront installation fee. This installation fee typically only covers a portion of the costs associated with purchasing, marketing, selling and installing each

<<<

 alarm system. As a result, the segment's operations represent an upfront investment in our business to acquire new customers, consequently driving revenue and profitability growth in our Portfolio Services segment. For the quarter ended June

<<<

 30, 2015, annualized, our Customer Acquisition segment generated 144.3 million of revenue, negative 151.7 million of Adjusted EBITDA and 195.5 million of capital expenditures.
The cost of acquiring a customer includes the cost of the alarm

<<<

 equipment installed at customer premises as well as marketing, sales, installation and other related activities. Our upfront investment (including the capital expenditures and other costs associated with originating a customer) is partially

<<<

 offset at the time of a sale by the installation fee paid by a new customer. We seek to subsequently recapture the remainder of our upfront investment through the monthly subscription fees, net of ongoing monitoring costs and services (EPC

<<<

), generated by the customer.
The costs of the alarm equipment purchased by us from our suppliers and installed in connection with newly acquired customers as well as part of variable sales costs are capitalized to the extent that ownership

<<<

 is retained. In the six months ended June 30, 2015, capital expenditures represented 54% of net acquisition cost per new customer (CPA). The remaining costs of acquiring a customer include sales and related costs that are expensed when incurred

<<<

, directly impacting our financial results for the period. From time to time we may also seek to enter into arrangements whereby third parties provide financing to our customers to allow them to finance a portion of the installation fee, which

<<<

 facilitates customer subscriptions without having an impact on our balance sheet.
Our key operating metrics for the segment include the breakeven or payback periods for the investments we make to originate new customers. We look at our CPA

<<<

, which represents the net investment required to acquire a new customer, and is defined as the average total cost and capital expenditures we incur in acquiring a new customer, net of the upfront installation fees received on average per customer

<<<

. CPA was 1,029, 1,040 and 1,103 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. By dividing CPA by the EPC generated within our Portfolio Services segment, we can approximate the minimum period we need to retain each customer

ended December 31, 2014, 63% of our revenue was denominated in euro, 20% of revenue was denominated in SEK, 11% of revenue was denominated in NOK and 6% of revenue was denominated in other currencies. Historically, the euro/SEK exchange

<<<

 rate fluctuated significantly, as it averaged SEK 8.6785 = EUR 1.0 in 2013 and SEK 9.1375 = EUR 1.0 in 2014, and for the six months ended June 30, 2015, the exchange rate averaged SEK 9.3007= EUR 1.0. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations can

<<<

 significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity. In addition, certain of our supply contracts in non

<<<

-euro denominated countries contain clauses that reset the prices at which we buy our goods based on fluctuations in exchange rates, which can increase our costs if rates move in a manner that is unfavorable to us. We have limited foreign exchange

<<<

 transaction risk as we incur costs and derive subscription fees in the local currency of our markets. Further, although 37% of our revenue is denominated in non-euro currencies, the majority of our indebtedness is euro-denominated. Pro forma

<<<

 for the Transactions, however, 21% of our indebtedness will be denominated in SEK, which will provide a partial natural hedge against movements in FX rates on a transactional basis.

We have presented in the following table certain of our financial

 and operating results on a constant currency basis to allow investors to compare our results of operations and certain operating metrics across periods on a like-for-like basis. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non

<<<

-operating impact on financial and operating measures, we believe that evaluating these financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of revenue to management. We have removed

<<<

 the effects of FX changes in our discussion of certain operating and financial metrics by re-translating each period's non-euro denominated results using a constant rate of exchange for each of the applicable currencies. Constant currency growth

<<<

 rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flow. These non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures

Changes in Local Regulations
Changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses. These changes may also result in delays in commencement or

<<<

 completion of services to our customers or the need to modify completed installations. These regulations govern our operations, from the sales and installation process through the monitoring and alarm verification process. New regulations could

<<<

 impact our go-to-market strategies, since authorities have increasingly sought to implement consumer protection requirements that could affect our business. An increasing number of local governmental authorities have adopted, or are considering

<<<

 the adoption of, laws, regulations or policies aimed at reducing the perceived costs to them of responding to false alarm signals. Among other things, these measures require verification of an alarm signal before the police will respond and

<<<

 subject alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for transmitting false alarms. For example, regulations are now in place in Spain, Italy, France and Portugal that require an alarm to be confirmed before police are dispatched (in France

<<<

 and Italy, these reports must be supported by evidence and reasonable certainty on the part of the reporting monitoring station). If we cannot pass these costs through to our customers, they may affect our profit margins. Conversely, our customer

<<<

 cancellation rates may increase.
Taxation
In December 2014, the Spanish tax authorities finalized an audit of the financial years 2008 to 2011. The tax cost for the finalized period, as well as the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, is

<<<

 31.2 million and was provided for in our accounts for the 2014 financial year.
Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results
Purchase Accounting Impact on OurFinancial Statements
We have accounted for the Acquisition using the acquisition

<<<

 method of accounting, which requires that the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by us plus the liabilities

<<<

 incurred by us to the former owners of the entities acquired by us and the equity interests issued by us in exchange for control of the business acquired. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. The identifiable

<<<

 assets acquired and the liabilities and contingencies of the Group will be recognized at their fair value at the Completion Date.
Where the sum of the consideration transferred, any non-controlling interests and Completion Date fair value of

<<<

 previously held equity interest exceeds the Completion Date fair value of identifiable net assets of the entities acquired by us; we will recognize the difference as goodwill in our consolidated statement of financial position.
The allocation

<<<

 of the purchase price of the identifiable assets acquired in the Acquisition may result in an increase in amortization and depreciation expense relating to acquired identifiable intangible assets and property and equipment currently carried

<<<

 at amortized cost due to remeasurement of the basis in the respective tangible and intangible assets to fair value at the date of acquisition and reconsideration of the remaining depreciable lives based on the policies of the Purchasers. We

<<<

 expect to recognize a substantial amount of goodwill in connection with the Acquisition. In addition, as result of the Acquisition, the authorization of the deferred revenue fair value adjustment has impacted the results presented for periods

<<<

 after the Acquisition.
Increased Leverage
As of June 30, 2015, we had 2,348.3 million of outstanding indebtedness, including shareholder funding. As a result of the Transactions we will be a highly leveraged company and our interest expense

<<<

 will increase significantly in the periods following the consummation of the Transactions. Additionally, pro forma for the Transactions, certain of our indebtedness will be denominated in SEK. While we will initially draw these funds in the

<<<

 euro equivalent, set to a pre-agreed exchange rate, the principal amount of the indebtedness will remain outstanding in SEK. To the extent the SEK/euro exchange rate varies, the euro equivalent amount due upon repayment of principal could increase

<<<

. We do not presently intend to hedge our SEK exposure as a portion of our revenues are denominated in SEK. We are also permitted to incur additional debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture, which debt may be used to fund

<<<

 acquisitions or for other purposes. Our large amount of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future

, industry or the economy in general. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes-- Despite our high level o f indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further

<<<

 exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness."
Expansion in Latin America and Acquisitions
We have had operations in Latin America since 2009 and now have a presence in Chile, Brazil and Peru. In July 2014, we acquired

<<<

 TeleAtlantic, a Brazilian monitored alarm service provider. The cash paid in the acquisition amounted to 22.7 million at the completion of the transaction with a further 8.0 million of deferred consideration. As of December 31, 2014, we recognized

<<<

 goodwill from the acquisition in the amount of 25.0 million on our consolidated statement of financial position. TeleAtlantic had approximately 21,000 customers as of July 31, 2014. We also acquired a small portfolio of customers in Chile in

<<<

 2014. We further added approximately 10,000 customers through our acquisition of Leadex Investments AB in Sweden in May, 2015.
Key Operating Metrics
Our management uses a number of key operating metrics, in addition to our IFRS financial measures

<<<

, in order to evaluate, monitor and manage our business. The non-IFRS operational and statistical information related to our operations included in this section is unaudited and has been derived from internal reporting systems. Although none

<<<

 of these metrics are measures of financial performance under IFRS, we believe that these metrics provide important insight into the operations and strength of our business. These metrics may not be comparable to similar terms used by competitors

<<<

 or other companies, and from time to time we may change our definitions of these metrics. These metrics include the following:
Adjusted EBITDA. `Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,

<<<

 write-offs and integration costs.
Adjusted EBITDA for our segments. "Adjusted EBITDA for our segments" is defined as revenue (including external and internal sales) minus cost of sales (including external and internal costs) and selling and

<<<

 administrative expenses. Our calculation of segment Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of depreciation and amortization, retirement of assets, financial items or income tax expense because these items are allocated at the Group level

<<<

. In addition, it does not reflect eliminations due to intercompany sales.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin. "Adjusted EBITDA Margin" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin from Portfolio Services. Adjusted EBITDA Margin

<<<

 from Portfolio Services is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services by revenue from Portfolio Services.
Average Revenue per User. ARPU is our Portfolio Services segment revenue consisting of monthly average subscription

<<<

 fees and sales of additional products and services divided by the average num ber o f customers during the relevant period.
Monthly Adjusted EBITDA per Customer. EPC is calculated by dividing the total monthly Adjusted EBITDA from managing

<<<

 our existing customer portfolio (which is our Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services) by the average number of customers.
Cancellations. Total number of cancelled subscriptions during the period, including cancellations on acquired portfolios

<<<

.
Cancellation Rate. Our cancellation rate is the number of terminated subscriptions (excluding cancellations from acquired portfolios) to our monitoring service in the last twelve months divided by the average number of customers (excluding

<<<

 acquired portfolios) for the last twelve months.
Cash Acquisition Cost per New Customer. Cash acquisition cost per new customer (CPA) is the net investment required to acquire a customer, including costs related to the marketing and sales process

<<<

, installation of the alarm system, costs of alarm system products and overhead expenses for the customer acquisition process. The metric is calculated net of any revenues from installation fees

LO\5912661.4

69

charged to the customer and

<<<

 represents the sum of Adjusted EBITDA plus capital expenditures in our Customer Acquisition segment on average for every customer acquired.
New Customers Added (gross). Total number of new customers added.
CustomerGrowth Rate. Number of customers

<<<

 at the end of the period divided by the number of customers twelve months previously.
Payback Period. Payback period represents the time in years required to recapture the initial capital investment made to acquire a new customer and is calculated

<<<

 as CPA divided by EPC, divided by 12.
Steady State Net Operating Cash Flow. "SSNOCF" is calculated by subtracting the net investment required to replace Cancellations from Adjusted EBITDA from Portfolio Services. The net investment is calculated

<<<

 by multiplying the CPA by the number of Cancellations.
The following table shows those key operating metrics for each of our segments as of and for the periods set forth below. These metrics are presented in this offering memorandum because

<<<

 we believe that these metrics provide a clearer picture of our results of operations generated by our core operating activities, thus enabling our management to evaluate relevant trends more meaningfully when considered in conjunction with

<<<

 (but not in lieu of) other measures that are calculated in accordance with IFRS. The metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting

<<<

 principles. Our nonIFRS operating metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial

<<<

 statements. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS operating metrics only supplementally to evaluate our performance. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information

<<<

."

Description o f Key Items in Our Income Statement

<<<


Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services net of value-added tax and discounts, and after eliminating sales within the group, and is recognized only where there is

<<<

 persuasive evidence of a sales agreement, the delivery of goods or services has occurred and, where there are contractual acceptance provisions, the customer has accepted the goods (or the right to reject them has lapsed), the sale price is

<<<

 fixed or determinable and the collectability of revenue is reasonably assured.
More specifically, income is recognized as follows:
 Alarm m onitoring. Income from alarm monitoring services is recognized during the period to which the service

<<<

 relates.
 Installation fees. As part of alarm installation, customers pay an installation fee and, in certain cases, payment for products sold. This fee is recognized as income on the installation date.
Revenue also consists of other revenue

<<<

, which is derived primarily from new products and services sold to customers in our existing installations.
Cost ofSales
Cost of sales includes cost of materials (excluding material costs that are capitalized), salaries, commissions, depreciation

<<<

, amortization, bad debt expense, cost due to retirement of alarms and other costs directly attributable to installation of new alarms or alarm monitoring. We currently capitalize the costs of the alarm equipment purchased by us from our suppliers

<<<

 and installed in connection with newly acquired customers to the extent we retain ownership of the equipment, and these costs are not reflected as cost of sales. In addition to material costs, we also capitalize direct costs related to the

<<<

 acquisition of customer contracts as intangible assets as they fulfil the requirement in IAS 38, intangible assets, of internally generated intangible assets.
Our salespeople sometimes both sell systems to new customers and install such systems

<<<

 once the sales are made. As a result, in these instances, the costs of both selling and installing the systems are included in costs of sales because they cannot be accurately separated. Thus, "cost of sales" includes some costs that are actually

<<<

 selling expenses but cannot be separately allocated to a specific selling and administrative function.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses includes salaries, commissions, depreciation and amortization, cost

<<<

 due to retirement of property, plant and equipment as used in selling and administrative functions, rents and other indirect costs for sales supervision, sales branches, customer support supervision, information technology services and other

<<<

 overhead such as finance and human resources and management.
Finance Income
Finance income primarily includes income earned from our currency and interest rate derivatives, interest income and any positive net exchange rate changes.
Finance

<<<

 Costs
Finance costs relates mainly to exchange rate differences, interest expenses, losses from currency derivatives, changes in fair value of interest rate swaps and other finance costs. External and intra group loan balances denominated in

<<<

 currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity are revalued at the end of each reporting period and adjusted for currency fluctuations.
Income Tax Expense
Income taxes include current and deferred tax. These taxes have

<<<

 been calculated at a nominal amount according to each country's tax provisions and the tax rates that have been defined or announced and are highly likely to become effective. Current tax is tax that is paid or received for the current year

<<<

 and includes any adjustments to current tax for prior years. In the case of items recognized directly in equity

* At the time of the approval of the interim report as of June 30, 2014, which was issued in August 2014, there was an ongoing tax audit in Spain. An agreement related to this tax audit was

<<<

 made in December 2014, which resulted in additional income tax of 34.4 million for the three months ended March 31,2014 and for the six months ended June 30, 2014.
In connection with this offering memorandum, the interim financial statement

<<<

 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and for the six months ended June 30, 2014, has been reissued by the board as of October 1, 2015. As the board must consider all available information at the time of signing, in accordance with IAS

<<<

 10 "Events after the reporting period," an adjustment has been made to the interim financial statements for the above periods due to the agreement with the tax authorities, compared to the interim report that was originally issued. The effect

<<<

 on the financial position is an increase in deferred tax liability and an increase in current tax liability amounting to a total of 34.4 million with a corresponding tax expense in the income statement.

 First, market participants need to gain awareness and brand trust among customers in order to be given permission to monitor customers' families and assets. This not only requires an established presence

<<<

 in the market but a field sales organization of a certain size. The GTM model requires interplay of customized products, brand, recruitment, training, lead generation and allocation, which we believe is highly complex to build and operate.

<<<

 We also seek to tailor our approach to the markets in which we are operating in order to deliver differentiated service to our customers that indicates comprehensive understanding of cultural norms and communities.
 Second, we believe that

<<<

 scale, including on a regional basis, is a differentiating factor in the alarm monitoring market. Scale provides avenues for increased investment in innovative product and service features, greater customization of products to fit GTM efforts

<<<

, enhanced monitoring and response service and the ability to drive lead generation through marketing spend.
 Third, the demands of customer safety and well-being drives significantly higher service level requirements than in many other subscription

<<<

-based businesses which we are able to address through deep customer know-how, our twelve monitoring centers and our sizeable sales force.
We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from these market dynamics owing to our established

<<<

 competitive position, the strength of brand and reputation, our scale and density of operations, our differentiated GTM model with experienced face-to-face salespeople, our technology and diversified customer base.
Subscription business with

<<<

 diversified, high quality and resilient custom er base with lo w churn
We have a geographically diversified portfolio of approximately 1.9 million customers as of June 30, 2015. Our focus on markets throughout Europe, including Scandinavia

<<<

 and Southern Europe, as well as certain markets in Latin America helps mitigate the risks of localized economic downturns. Our residential customers tend to be middle-to-higher income households with assets to protect and lower

Deliver industry leading profitability

 through cost optimization and operational excellence
By increasing customer engagement and offering additional services, we believe we will continue to deliver industry-leading churn and increase average revenue per customer (ARPU). Additionally

<<<

, we are striving to implement a number of measures for efficiency gains replicating best practices. For example, we are currently in the implementation phase of our FOG cost savings program, under which we expect to realize cash savings of

<<<

 approximately 327 million by June 2016, with the full program targeting over twice this amount. The FOG program includes selected cost categories of our business (portfolio operations, direct spend and indirect procurement and spend (excluding

<<<

 marketing spend)).
These initiatives are intended to improve our performance in customer care, reduce direct material costs and operating expenses, sustainably improve product quality and enhance our business stability. We have done substantial

<<<

 work to identify cost savings and develop these initiatives, including working with third-party consultants, and seek to leverage our managers' expertise, which includes successful implementation of similar programs. See "B u s in e s s --

We offer our customers a comprehensive security solution, including the sales and installation of our alarm systems designed in-house and ongoing monitoring services to verify

<<<

 triggered alarms and coordinate necessary emergency responses. We believe that offering a full suite of services and products provides us with a competitive advantage in our markets, especially compared to certain competitors in certain markets

<<<

 who offer only a limited range of services. We have two segments: our Portfolio Services segment, through which we manage our existing customer base; and our Customer Acquisition segment, through which we seek to gain new customers to replace

<<<

 cancelling customers and selectively grow our customer base.
Portfolio Services
Our Portfolio Services segment provides monitoring services to our existing customers and consists primarily of four types of operating activities: alarm monitoring

<<<

; customer service and support; product development; and alarm response coordination.
A la rm M o n ito rin g
We provide all of our monitoring services in-house, using our own employees with one monitoring center covering each of the markets

<<<

 in which we have significant operations. Each of our monitoring centers has a facility designated as a back-up facility where we can transfer most of our monitoring and customer service capabilities in a short period of time. In some of our

<<<

 larger markets this backup facility is a facility in close proximity to the main monitoring center. In other markets we use a monitoring center in one of our other markets to serve as the backup facility. In each case, the backup facility will

<<<

 be able to operate as a fully functional monitoring center if we need to transfer operations. This back up capability is intended to ensure that our customers will not experience a significant service gap if one of our centers has a malfunction

<<<

 or disruption.
Our alarm monitoring centers receive thousands of alarm triggers every day. Our monitoring staff analyzes each triggered alarm through a process of verification and prioritization whereby they identify false alarms and reduce

<<<

 the number of times false alarm messages are forwarded to emergency responders (such as police and fire departments). We use a variety of techniques to verify alarms. In many markets, we primarily use call-backs, whereby our operator calls

<<<

 the customer to determine the reason for the alarm, often using code words. There is usually a separate code for deactivating a false alarm and another code for a duress situation. If the duress password is given, our staff will alert the police

<<<

. Certain of our alarm systems also use camera detectors that record a sequence of images when an alarm is triggered and subsequently transmit these images to the monitoring center for operator verification. A third verification technique used

 in some markets is a guard service that will

partner and the customer on our behalf. Selection of partners involves a strict evaluation process that focuses

<<<

 on key attributes such as entrepreneurial and sales skills and knowledge of the regional area. Once selected, partners undergo rigorous training to ensure that they meet the same high standards we expect of our own employees. We design our

<<<

 compensation plans for our partners to align their goals with our targeted key performance indicators, which helps us generate quality accounts and encourages high quality customer service and long-term partnerships.
We design our marketing

<<<

 strategy to support our field sales and to grow our brand awareness. These efforts often include local TV advertisements, online marketing and cooperation with local companies (for example, utility and insurance companies). Online marketing

<<<

 is an increasingly important component of our marketing strategy, as our websites provide information about our products and services and enable potential customers to book a sales and qualification visit by one of our salesinstallers. Further

<<<

, we work with various alliance partners, including insurance companies and banks, in most of our markets to generate leads and increase awareness of professionally monitored alarm services among families and small business owners.
P ro d u

 c t O ffe rin g s an d P ro d u c t S tra te g y
We believe that the more user friendly, functional and integrated into our customers' daily lives our products are, the more likely our customers are to retain our services over the long term

<<<

. Our product strategy combines what we believe to be superior services with advanced technology. Accordingly, we have five key goals:
 deterrence that relies on exterior signs and alarm sirens;
 detection using magnetic and motion detectors

<<<

 with cameras;
 identification and verification using high-quality image, two-way voice and voice recording;
 personal protection; and
 rapid response to alarm triggers (within approximately 60 seconds from the time the alarm is triggered

<<<

).
A typical new alarm installation would consist of the following:
 a central unit with wireless communication and control of other alarm components (the gateway);
 a control panel for switching the alarm system on and off with a security

<<<

 code or smart key;
 an alarm siren;
 a number of camera and movement detectors; and
 door and window magnetic contacts.
Additional residential offerings include a wireless smoke detector that communicates with other smoke detectors in the

<<<

 home for quicker warning in the case of a fire.
The control panel for our products uses two-way radio. As an alternative to a security code, the alarm can be activated or deactivated using a smart key. These devices are securely linked to our

<<<

 central monitoring station and can also be accessed from the internet via our web-based MyPages application as well as from customers' smartphones using our Verisure App. With these applications, customers can, for example, activate and deactivate

<<<

 their alarm systems, receive the status of the alarm, remotely unlock doors and control other home automation functions through their personal devices, including smartphones.
By bundling services and establishing partnerships with companies

<<<

 in complementary segments, we have begun extending some our core services in the context of the "connected home." For instance, through alliances with companies like ASSA ABLOY, Panasonic and Anticimex, we have begun offering digital locks

<<<

, lighting and electrical devices and indoor climate supervision.
Our platform also provides the flexibility to seamlessly add new applications to our security system. Our add on features include additional keypads, additional door and window

<<<

 magnetic contacts, automatic switches to open doors and windows, flood detectors, humidity detectors, additional encrypted keys and SOS buttons. In some markets, customers are able to order certain add-on

LO\5912661.4

103

features from

<<<

 our websites. Some add on features may be self-installed by the customer, while other features require a sales installer to install such products.
The majority of our small business installations use the same wireless platform that we use in

<<<

 our residential alarms, but with added functionality, such as access control and video capture. Our small business installations also offer more customized solutions, including product peripherals that can be mixed and matched to meet the needs

<<<

 of each customer.
F u n d in g O u r G row th T oge ther - C o s t S a vin g s Initiative
In July 2015, we began implementing our first group-wide operational improvement plan, FOG, with the aim of optimizing our cost structure and improving

<<<

 productivity. This board and managementapproved cost savings program seeks to leverage our scale and share proven best practices across our global footprint, thereby reducing costs and improving our margins. In early 2015, we launched an in

<<<

-depth diagnostic of our group-wide cost profile and identified overall initial savings potential through the course of developing detailed savings initiatives, targets and implementation schedules for each country. Management estimates that

<<<

 approximately 327 million of savings can be achieved by the end of the second quarter of 2016, with the full program targeting over twice such amount to be realized by 2018. Since July, we have been implementing three categories of initiatives

<<<

:
 P ortfolio Operations: Approximately 62% of the FOG initiatives that we intend to implement relate to our portfolio operations, where we seek to generate the highest proportion of cost savings. The initiatives we intend to implement in this

<<<

 category are aimed at: lowering maintenance costs by focusing on automation, improving product quality, introducing refurbished products and reducing the number of maintenance visits; focusing on improving call-center operations and expanding

<<<

 customer self-service; and lowering the total number of call-outs (i.e., dispatching guards to customers). The operational teams in each country have developed initiatives based on their own experiences as well as the insights gained from cross

<<<

-country sharing of best practices.
 D irect Spend: Approximately 22% of the FOG initiatives we intend to implement are aimed at lowering our direct spend by renegotiating prices for our core products with our main suppliers, implementing technological

<<<

 insights gained from our analysis of our competitors' products, and optimizing our manufacturing supply chain. We are also implementing technical optimizations based on a full teardown of all our major products as well as those of our competitors

<<<

. We have also identified cost savings potential associated with switching to lower cost suppliers in other European countries.
 Procurem ent and Indirect Spend: Approximately 16% of the FOG initiatives we intend to implement are aimed at reducing

<<<

 our indirect spend, primarily through the implementation of professional procurement practices across our global footprint (including the establishment of a group-wide procurement function), leveraging our purchasing scale in negotiations with

<<<

 vendors and lowering costs associated with our car fleet, telecom services and office IT costs.
We have tested the applicability of almost all of our cost savings initiatives by implementing them in the daily operations of one or two of the

<<<

 countries in which we operate. Implementation in each country is monitored by top management and is driven by local experts, with stringent KPI tracking (e.g. share of automation, visits per customer, average handling time per call and share

<<<

 of first-time fixes/resolution), regular follow-up meetings and reporting to top management.
Successful realization of our anticipated cost savings is subject to a number of assumptions. See "R is k

We market primarily under our SECURITAS DIRECT (or DANSIKRING DIRECT in Denmark) brand. When we began our business in 1988, the SECURITAS DIRECT name

<<<

 leveraged the reputation that the broader SECURITAS brand name had in the security business market, and we expanded this reputation to the residential and small business alarm market. We believe our logotype and trademark are now widely recognized

<<<

 in the residential and small business marketplace and make up important elements of our marketing and sales strategy.

LO\5912661.4

104

We license the SECURITAS DIRECT brand name from Securitas AB. On December 30, 2005, we signed our current

<<<

 license agreements with Securitas AB, which granted us the right to use certain domain names, business names and trademarks that belonged to Securitas AB. The agreements grant us the nonexclusive right to use the logotype and trademark SECURITAS

<<<

 (in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) and DANSIKRING (in Denmark), in each instance in combination with the word "DIRECT." At the same time, Securitas AB cannot use or license its name for

<<<

 use with "DIRECT" to any other parties in our territories. In accordance with these agreements, we can sublicense our rights to our subsidiaries that are wholly owned and controlled by us as well as to our partners who are responsible for installation

<<<

 and maintenance of our alarm systems. The fee for the licenses granted under the agreements is 0.2% of our gross sales in the relevant operating geography. Subject to certain termination provisions, the agreement remains in force until December

<<<

 29, 2029.
In 2009, we developed the proprietary Verisure brand to complement Securitas Direct as part of our long-term branding strategy. In the long term, we plan to continue developing our Verisure brand to be associated with cutting-edge

<<<

, user-friendly technology that can seamlessly integrate with a customer's other hardware. This approach is characterized by our development of the MyPages web application and Verisure App for smartphones. Our goal is for Verisure, with its

<<<

 brand and technological capabilities, to provide us a competitive advantage in the relevant markets in which we compete. We position Verisure alongside Securitas Direct so that our customers equate Verisure with the same quality offerings as

<<<

 Securitas Direct.
R e g u la tio n
Our operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements in the markets in which we operate. Thus, most regulations we encounter are country or municipality specific regulations

<<<

. We do, however, encounter country or local regulations that apply specifically to the alarm industry in all the markets in which we operate.
Sales and Marketing
Some jurisdictions regulate the method of retail sales by restricting door-to

<<<

-door sales, cold-calls or direct mailing. With the exception of Swedish legislation regulating when unsolicited sales-based emails may be sent, we do not currently encounter these regulations in our largest markets, such as Spain, Sweden, France

<<<

, Portugal and Norway. However, Denmark does prohibit door-to-door sales. In this market, we have had to alter our sales approach to rely more on advertising our products in public forums. Additionally, other markets, such as Spain and Sweden

<<<

, may in the future seek to introduce these sorts of regulations. If we continue to encounter these regulations, it may require us to change our sales approach with potential customers. See "R is k F a c to rs -- R is k s R e la te d to O u

<<<

 a n d n e g a tiv e c o n s e q u e n c e s ." All of our markets also have regulations protecting consumers in their dealings with a company's sales force. Typically these regulations may either provide a customer with a guaranteed trial period

<<<

 or limit the length of a contract that a customer may sign.
Alarm Verification
We are subject to regulations covering the dispatching of emergency personnel and false alarms. An increasing number of local governmental authorities have adopted

<<<

 laws, regulations or policies aimed at reducing the perceived costs to them of responding to false alarm signals. For example, in France police will only respond to an alarm they have been forwarded once that alarm has been verified. Spain

<<<

, our largest market, has recently enacted a ministerial order requiring that alarms be verified either through video, audio or personal verification steps. Otherwise, emergency personnel will not respond unless three sequential alarms are triggered

<<<

 within 30 minutes. If emergency personnel are dispatched to a false alarm, some jurisdictions allow for penalties to be imposed on either the alarm owner or the alarm provider. In France, police are allowed to penalize the alarm provider for

<<<

 a false alarm that has been forwarded. Likewise, in Spain, emergency responders have discretion to impose penalties for frequent false alarms as high as 330,000 per incident. These changes will require security alarm providers to use third

<<<

-party guard services to verify alarms, install new monitoring equipment or upgrade existing equipment, and as a result we incurred additional expenditures during 2011 and 2012, which were in part passed on to our customers. See "R is k F a

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Senior Notes Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to release

<<<

 any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantor liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantor liabilities and any other senior secured liabilities will

<<<

 be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor), following that release

<<<

.
Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any senior secured debt would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to the Parent (or its immediate

<<<

 holding company after the relevant Distressed Disposal), in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or Holdco (or its immediate holding company after the relevant Distressed Disposal) and

<<<

 without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.
If before the Senior Notes Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal

<<<

 is being effected such that the guarantees under the Senior Notes Finance Documents (the "Senior Guarantees" and each party granting such Senior Guarantees is a "Senior Notes Guarantor") and security granted over the shares in the Senior Notes

<<<

 Issuer or the on-loan of the Senior Notes proceeds or assets of a Senior Notes Guarantor will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that either:
 the Senior Notes Trustee has approved

<<<

 the release; or
 where shares or assets of a Senior Notes Guarantor or assets of the Senior Notes Issuer are sold:
(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal:
(I) are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable securities; or

<<<


(II) (only if the consideration in respect of each other cash offer received for those shares or assets is less than the aggregate par value of the outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities) not in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other

<<<

 marketable securities, provided that the requirements of paragraph (C)(III) below are satisfied;
(B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors against a member of the Group (if any), all of whose shares are pledged in favor of the senior finance

<<<

 parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security

<<<

 under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim

<<<

 (instead of a release or discharge):
(I) the Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the senior finance parties and the Senior Secured Notes finance parties (respectively) will recover

<<<

 more than if such claim was released or discharged; and
(II) the Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same,
in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled

<<<

 immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser); and
(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:
(I) pursuant to a public or private auction or other competitive

<<<

 process in which the Senior Noteholders (or a representative acting on their behalf) shall be entitled to participate as bidder or financier to the potential purchaser and shall be provided equal information rights as any other bidder, subject

<<<

 to applicable securities law (and for the avoidance of doubt, such competitive process being one in which the Senior Secured Creditors or a representative acting on their behalf are also entitled to participate);)(I
(II) pursuant to any process

<<<

 or proceedings approved or supervised by or on behalf of any court of law where there is a determination of value by or on behalf of the court; or

(III) where an independent investment bank or an internationally recognized

<<<

 firm of accountants or a reputable independent third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations in respect of the relevant type and size of the assets concerned selected by the Security Agent has delivered an

<<<

 opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement provided that the liability

<<<

 of such investment bank or internationally recognized firm of accountants in giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.
For the purposes of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) above and the immediately

<<<

 preceding clause (C), the Security Agent shall act:
 if the relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the security, prior to the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date, in accordance with the provisions set out under

<<<

, and provided further, however, that this shall not prevent the Trustee in respect of the Senior Secured Notes from claiming and being paid the amounts due to it in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes Trustee from claiming

<<<

 and being paid the amounts due it in respect of the Senior Notes. This shall not prevent a Senior Secured Creditor benefiting from such Group Recoveries where it was not legally possible for the Senior Secured Creditor to obtain the relevant

<<<

 guarantees or security.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any debt document (other than recoveries from the Senior Notes Issuer other
