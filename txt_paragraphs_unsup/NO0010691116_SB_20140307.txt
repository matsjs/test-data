<<<

 Agreement). Terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meaning as in the Bond Agreement.
On 11 February 2014, the Parent published a press release concerning Mexican administrative penalty proceedings that had been brought against

<<<

On 18 February 2014, the Bond

<<<

 Trustee requested further information from the Borrower on certain events which could constitute Events of Default under the Bond Agreement. The Borrower sent a reply letter on 19 February 2014, inter alia informing the Bond Trustee of the

<<<

 following matters:
(a) That the Parent had failed to pay an amount of USD 18,843,750 that was due on 15 January 2014 under a corporate bond issued by the Parent in the amount of US$ 335,000,000 with Citibank N.A as trustee (the "Parent Bond

<<<

") and that, although no event of default has been declared under the terms of the Parent Bond, the Borrower has confirmed that this non-payment (if not remedied within any applicable grace period), together with suspension of certain additional

<<<

 credit facilities of the Parent, qualifies as an Event of Default under Clause 15.1(c) of the Bond Agreement.
(b) That the Parent had initiated discussions with certain bondholders in respect of the Parent Bond.
(c) That the bareboat hire for

<<<

 the month of February, which was due on 1 February 2014, has not been paid by the Parent, but that this hire will be paid by the Parent within 20 days (of the date of the notification); furthermore, the Parent intends to pay the monthly bareboat

<<<

 hire until the Vessel is employed under a new contract.
(d) That the Minister of Public Function of Mexico has determined that Federal Dependencies and Entities, the General Federal Attorney, and Mexican States, must not propose, or enter into

<<<

, any contract to or with Oceanografia for a period of one year, nine months and twelve days from the date of determination.
In the Borrower's reply letter of 19 February 2014, the Borrower requested the Bond Trustee not to declare an Event

<<<

 of Default until after 1 April 2014. A copy of the letter from the Bond Trustee to the Borrower dated 18 February 2014 and a copy of the reply letter from the Borrower dated 19 February 2014 is attached to this summons for reference.

NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
1. Declaration of Event of Default and enforcement of Security Interests
In light of

<<<

 the above circumstances, following the receipt by the Bond Trustee of binding instructions from certain Bondholders holding more than 50 per cent, of the principal amount outstanding of the Bonds (the "Instructing Bondholders"), the Bond Trustee

<<<

:
(1) declared the Outstanding Bonds to be in default and due for immediate payment in accordance with Clause 15.3 of the Bond Agreement (the Notice of Default and Acceleration has been posted on www.stamdata.no); and
(2) took action under the

<<<

 Issuer's Share charge to remove the existing directors of the Borrower, and appoint two independent directors to the Board of the Borrower.
The intention is that the independent directors would safeguard the interests of the Borrower's creditors

<<<

. Accordingly, subsequent to these steps, the Bareboat Charter has been terminated, and the current intention of the Instructing Bondholders is that steps should be taken between the Borrower and Bondholders to sell the Vessel and maximise recoveries

<<<

 for the Bondholders and other stakeholders o f the Borrower.
2. Bond Trustee Indemnity
In light of the occurrence of the Events of Default described above and the steps taken by the Bond Trustee, as is contemplated by the Bond Agreement, the

<<<

 Bond Trustee has been provided with an indemnity by certain of the Instructing Bondholders (the "Indemnity Agreement"). Each Bondholder who is not already a party to the Indemnity Agreement shall be entitled to enter into it; any Bondholder

<<<

 wishing to do so should contact the Bond Trustee.
Amongst other things, the Indemnity Agreement provides that:
(a) Instructing Bondholders together holding more than 50 per cent, of the principal amount outstanding of the Bonds may provide

<<<

 instructions to the Bond Trustee from time to time in connection with the preservation and enforcement of the rights and interests of Bondholders (the "Instructing Bondholder Mechanism");
(b) before the Bond Trustee demands payment under the

<<<

 indemnity granted by the indemnifying Bondholders, it will first resort to the funds standing to the credit of the Liquidity Account and the Debt Service Account (both of which are secured in favour of the Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders

<<<

), which together hold approximately US$ 8.9 million as at the date of this summons, and will, subject to a minimum liquidity buffer o f US$1,000,000 which shall be retained by the Bond Trustee in those accounts, apply those funds in satisfaction

<<<

 of amounts that would otherwise fall within the indemnification obligations of the indemnifying Bondholders (the "Application of Secured Funds"); and
(c) any amounts advanced to the Bond Trustee by the indemnifying Bondholders pursuant to their

<<<

 indemnification obligations in the Indemnify Agreement will be subject to:
(i) an interest rate of 15% per annum (the "Indemnity Funding Interest Rate"); and
(ii) a super priority ranking, pursuant to which any payments or funds with respect

<<<

 to the Bonds recovered or received by the Bond Trustee from the Borrower, the Guarantors or any other source (whether by way of receipt of
2

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
due and payable amounts, enforcement of Security Interests, legal

<<<

 action or any other means) are applied in repayment of the amounts advanced by Bondholders under the indemnity (pro rata amongst the indemnity providers) on a super priority basis ahead of any payment of principal, interest, premium or otherwise

<<<

 on the Bonds (the "Indemnity Funding Super Priority Status"), subject to the Super Priority Pari Passu Status (see below in section 4).
In connection with the provision of the indemnity to the Bond Trustee pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement

<<<

, Bondholders are hereby requested to approve the Instructing Bondholder Mechanism, the Application of Secured Funds, the Indemnity Funding Interest Rate and the Indemnity Funding Super Priority Status (together, the "Indemnity Approvals").

<<<


3. Bondholders' Expenses and funding
It is possible that additional funding may be required by the Borrower or the Bond Trustee in connection with maximising recoveries for Bondholders. Accordingly, the Bondholders' Meeting is requested to

<<<

 approve a funding mechanism for the purpose of meeting fees, costs, expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with the protection, preservation and/or enforcement of the Bondholders' rights and pursuing recoveries, as set out below

<<<

 (together, the "Recovery Expenses"), on a basis shared by all of the Bondholders. Recovery Expenses may include (but shall not be limited to) the following:
(a) fees, costs, expenses and disbursements incurred by the Bond Trustee, including

<<<

 in respect of its own advisers, agents, delegates and counsel, including (without limitation) BA-HR (as lead counsel of the Bond Trustee);
(b) the fees, costs, expenses and disbursements of the Bondholders' advisers, including, without limitation

<<<

, Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP and any financial adviser that may be appointed by the Bond Trustee to represent the interests o f the Bondholders; and
(c) the fees, costs, expenses and disbursements arising in respect of the operation, management

<<<

 and crewing of the Vessel.
The Bondholders are hereby requested to approve the following potential funding structures in respect of the Recovery Expenses:
(a) the borrowing of a loan by the Borrower or the issuance by the Borrower of a further

<<<

 issue of bonds, which would be offered for subscription to existing Bondholders on a pro rata basis (based on each Bondholder's holding of the Bonds at that time), the terms of which would be based on the terms of the Bond Agreement, subject

<<<

 to (i) negotiation in respect of (amongst other things) the maturity of the new bonds and (ii) the Bondholder Funding Interest Rate and the Bondholder Funding Super Priority Ranking (each as defined below) (the "Funding Bond Issue"); and/or

<<<


(b) a limited-recourse loan to the Bond Trustee (the "Bondholder Loan") provided by some or all of the Bondholders (where each Bondholder is entitled to participate in the Bondholder Loan on a pro rata basis, based on its holdings of the Bonds

<<<

 at that time) to be documented in a loan agreement on standard terms for a loan of this nature, subject to the Bondholder Funding Interest Rate and the Bondholder Funding Super Priority Ranking (each as defined below),
where the aggregate of

<<<

 the principal par value of the Funding Bond Issue and the principal amount of the Bondholder Loan may not exceed US$ 15 million (provided that Bondholders
3

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
holding more than 50% of the principal amount

<<<

 outstanding of the Bonds shall be entitled to increase this amount).
Both the Bondholder Loan and the Funding Bond Issue will be subject to (amongst other things) the following specific terms:
(a) an interest rate of 15% per annum on amounts

<<<

 funded from the time (the "Bondholder Funding Interest Rate"); and
(b) a super priority ranking, pursuant to which any payments or funds with respect to the Bonds recovered or received by the Bond Trustee from the Borrower, the Guarantors or

<<<

 any other source (whether by way of receipt of due and payable amounts, enforcement of Security Interests, legal action or any other means) are applied in repayment of the Funding Bond Issue or the Bondholder Loan (pro rata amongst the participating

<<<

 funding providers), as the case may be, on a super priority basis ahead of any payment of principal, interest, premium or otherwise on the Bonds (the "Bondholder Funding Super Priority Ranking").
4. Pari Passu Ranking Amongst Super Priority

<<<

 Facilities
Each of the Funding Bond Issue, the Bondholder Loan and amounts advanced to the Bond Trustee under the Indemnity Agreement (each a "Funding Facility") would be subject to a super priority ranking, but would rank amongst themselves

<<<

 pari passu, with any payments or funds with respect to the Bonds recovered or received by the Bond Trustee from the Borrower, the Guarantors or any other source (whether by way of receipt of due and payable amounts, enforcement of Security

<<<

 Interests, legal action or any other means) applied pro rata amongst the Funding Facilities (based on the principal amount outstanding o f each o f the Funding Facilities at the time of repayment) ahead of any payment of principal, interest

<<<

, premium or otherwise on the Bonds (the "Super Priority Pari Passu Status").
5. Proposal
Based on the above, the Bondholders are requested to approve the following proposal (the "Proposal"):
"The Bondholders:
