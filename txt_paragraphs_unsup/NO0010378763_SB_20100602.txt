"FRN Marine Accurate Well ASA Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012" with ISIN NO 001035580.3 (the "Secured Bond");

2. Background
The Borrower is a single-asset company with a semi-submersible rig (the "Rig") under construction at Cosco Shipyard Group in China. The Rig is a purpose built heavy well intervention and drilling unit targeted for world-wide

<<<

 operations, with special emphasis on the North Sea.
Due to the prevailing market conditions, and despite the extensive marketing efforts that the Borrower claims have been undertaken towards several prospective customers, the Borrower has been

<<<

 unable to secure a contract for the Rig.
In the Bondholders' meetings in the Loans held on 10 July 2009, the interest due on each of the Loans during the second half of 2009 was postponed in order to allow the Borrower to continue its efforts

<<<

 to secure a contract for the Rig. In the Bondholders' meeting held in the First Convertible Loan on 14 January 2010, the interest due on 9 January 2010 on the First Convertible Loan was postponed until 26 February 2010.
On 24 February 2010

<<<

, the Loan Trustee agreed to extend the grace period for payment of interest under the Loans to allow for discussions regarding a possible restructuring, and to maintain stability at the Borrower. The extension shall continue until the Loan

<<<

 Trustee gives two Banking Days' written notice of the expiry of the grace period.
In order to seek a solution to the immediate challenges facing the Borrower and its stakeholders, the Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to summon Bondholders

<<<

' meetings in each of the Loans to propose to the Bondholders a financial restructuring of the Borrower's debt through a conversion of the Loans into equity (the "Debt-to-Equity Swap"). In addition, the Borrower intends to conduct a share issue

<<<

 raising gross proceeds of between NOK 213.25 million and NOK 360 million (the "Share Issue", and together with the Debt-to-Equity Swap, the "Restructuring"). An underwriting consortium comprising certain existing shareholders and Bondholders

<<<

 has agreed to guarantee for NOK 213.25 million of the Share Issue at a subscription price of NOK 0.45 per Share.
The Borrower believes that the Restructuring is essential to enable the Borrower to meet its immediate funding requirements.
In

<<<

 addition to this summons letter, the Borrower has provided a separate document enclosed as Exhibit 1 to this summons, which gives an update of the Borrower's financial and operational status as well as the reasons for the Restructuring. Bondholders

<<<

 are encouraged to read both documents.
For further information about the Borrower, please refer to its web site at www.maracc.no.
3. The Debt-to-Equity Swap
The Debt-to-Equity Swap is proposed to be carried out as follows:
I) Conversion of

<<<

 the Secured Bond - The Borrower proposes that the full amount of the Outstanding Loan and all accrued and unpaid interest under the Secured Bond up to and including 31 May 2010 shall be converted into 522,179,257 new ordinary shares in the

<<<

 Borrower ("Shares"). For the purpose of calculating the Outstanding Loan and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon as of 31 May 2010 only, and subject to a completion of the Restructuring, the Borrower proposes for practical purposes that

<<<

 the coupon rate for the Secured Loan for the period from and including 27 May 2010 to 31 May 2010 shall be set to the same coupon rate that prevailed for the period from and including 26 February 2010 to 27 May 2010 (i.e. 5.25194% p.a.). Applying

<<<

 such coupon rate, the Outstanding Loan and the
2

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
w w w .rriKstcc.no
accrued and unpaid interest under the Secured Bond as at 31 May 2010 amounted to USD 130,544,814 (excluding Borrower's Bond in the principal amount

<<<

 USD 1.0 million held by the Borrower1), implying a conversion price of USD 0.25. Immediately after the conversion of the Loans, the Bondholders in the Secured Bond will in aggregate hold approximately 75.1% of all the Shares outstanding in

<<<

 the Borrower. For the purpose of effecting the conversion, the amount to be converted and the conversion price will be converted to NOK by applying the USD/NOK conversion price as at 31 May 2010 of 6.45 (the "Conversion Rate"). Consequently

<<<

, upon conversion of the Secured Loan an amount of NOK 842,014,052.50 will be converted into 522,179,257 new Shares at a conversion price of NOK 1.6125.
II) Conversion of the First Convertible Bond - As at 31 May 2010, the Outstanding Loan and

<<<

 the accrued and unpaid interest under the First Convertible Bond amounted to USD 94,398,121. The Borrower proposes that the full amount of the Outstanding Loan and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to and including 31 May 2010 shall

<<<

 be converted into 113,282,276 new Shares in the Borrower, implying a conversion price of USD 0.8333. Immediately after the conversion of the Loans, the Bondholders in the First Convertible Bond will in aggregate hold approximately 16.3% of

<<<

 all the Shares outstanding in the Borrower. For the purpose of effecting the conversion, the amount to be converted and the conversion price will be converted to NOK by applying the Conversion Rate. Consequently, upon conversion of the First

<<<

 Convertible Loan an amount of NOK 608,867,879.20 will be converted into 113,282,276 new Shares at a conversion price of NOK 5.3748.
III) Conversion of the Second Convertible Bond - As at 31 May 2010, the Outstanding Loan and the accrued and

<<<

 unpaid interest under the Second Convertible Bond amounted to USD 35,382,827. The Borrower proposes that the full amount of the Outstanding Loan and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to and including 31 May 2010 shall be converted

<<<

 into 42,461,090 new Shares in the Borrower, implying a conversion price of USD 0.8333. Immediately after the conversion of the Loans, the Bondholders in the Second Convertible Bond will in aggregate hold approximately 6.1% of all the Shares

<<<

 outstanding in the Borrower. For the purpose of effecting the conversion, the amount to be converted and the conversion price will be converted to NOK by applying the Conversion Rate. Consequently, upon conversion of the Second Convertible

<<<

 Loan an amount of NOK 228,219,230.90 will be converted into 42,461,090 new Shares at a conversion price of NOK 5.3748.
IV) Interest - In order to facilitate the Debt-to-Equity Swap, payment of interest on the Loans shall be postponed until

<<<

 30 July 2010. If the Debt-to-Equity Swap is approved at the Bondholders' meetings by 21 June 2010, and completion2 of the Restructuring (the "Completion") occurs prior to 30 July 2010, no further interest shall accrue on the Loan after 31 May

<<<

 2010. If the Bondholders' meeting in all of the Loans have not approved the Restructuring by 21 June 2010, or Completion has not occurred by 30 July 2010, overdue interest shall continue to accrue on the Outstanding Loans and the amount of

<<<

 any interest being overdue or postponed at the respective coupon rate for each Loan plus 5.00% per annum.
1All Borrower's Bonds held by the Borrower will be written down and discharged upon the completion of the Restructuring, and no Shares

<<<

 will be allotted to such Borrower's Bonds. 2 For the avoidance of doubt, "completion" shall in this context mean that (i) the increase of share capital (i.e. the Debtto-Equity Swap and the first tranche o f the Share Issue) o f the Borrower

<<<

 has been duly registered in the Brønnøysund Register Center and (ii) the second tranche of the Share Issue is fully subscripted (but not paid in).
3

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
w w w . m s s t e c '. n o
V) The new Shares to be issued upon the

<<<

 Debt-to-Equity Swap will be allotted to the holders of Bonds or unpaid interest claim under the Bond Agreements as registered as owners of bonds or claims by VPS on a record date which will be fixed by the Loan Trustee and the VPS prior to

<<<

 the completion of the Debt-to-Equity Swap.
VI) No fractional Shares - Upon the conversion of the Loans into Shares, no fractions of Shares will be issued, and the number of Shares issued to each Bondholder will be rounded down to the nearest

<<<

 whole new Share.
VII) Amendments to the Articles of Association - Article 5 of the Borrower's Articles of Association currently contain provisions requiring any acquirer that acquires more than 40% of the Shares to make a mandatory offer to

<<<

 the other shareholders. Furthermore, Article 6 of the Articles of Association requires that where an acquisition of Shares caused the acquirer upon acquisitions to cross certain ownership thresholds, the acquirer shall notify the Borrower's

<<<

 board of directors. As part of the Restructuring, Articles 5 and 6 will be deleted from the Articles of Association.
VIII) Conditions - The Debt-to-Equity Swap is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:
a. the approval

<<<

 of the Debt-to-Equity Swap by the Bondholders in each of the Loans;
b. the approval of the Restructuring by the general meeting of the Borrower, and the adoption of all resolutions required for the Restructuring to be consummated, including

<<<

 the approval of a reduction of the share capital in the Borrower in which the par value of the Shares is reduced from NOK 1.00 to NOK 0.10, and the deletion of Articles 5 and 6 of the Borrower's Articles of Association;
c. receipt of subscriptions

<<<

 for at least 473,888,889 new Shares in the Share Issue at a subscription price of NOK 0.45 per Share; and
d. the Completion occurring no later than 30 July 2010.
4. The Share Issue
In the Share Issue, the Borrower will issue between 473,88

<<<

8,889 and 800,000,000 new Shares at a subscription price of NOK 0.45 per Share, raising gross proceeds of between NOK 213.250 million and 360 million. Shareholders and Bondholders of record as at end of business on 16 June 2010 shall have preferential

<<<

 right to subscribe for and be allocated Shares in the Share Issue in proportion to the shareholding they would have had if the Debt-to-Equity Swap had been completed on such date (i.e., the Bondholders will be offered to participate in the

<<<

 Share Issue on an "as if converted" basis). The Borrower will use the net proceeds from the Share Issue for its general corporate purposes.
An underwriting consortium comprising certain existing shareholders and Bondholders has agreed to guarantee

<<<

 that a minimum of 473,888,889 new Shares will be issued in the Share Issue at a subscription price of NOK 0.45 per Share. In consideration of their underwriting, the members of the underwriting consortium will receive an aggregate of 35,54

<<<

1,000 warrants, each of which will entitle the holder to subscribe to one new Share at a price of NOK 0.45. The warrants will have a maturity of three years.
4
i

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
www.fmsrcc.no

The subscription period for the Share Issue

<<<

 will commence on or about 8 June 2010 and end on or about 21 June 2010 (unless closed earlier or extended at the Borrower's discretion). The Share Issue will be divided into two equal tranches of between NOK 106.625 million and NOK 180 million

<<<

. For the first tranche, the deadline for payment of the subscription amount will be on or about 21 June 2010, and for the second tranche the deadline for payment of the subscription amount will be 20 August 2010. Otherwise, the terms of the

<<<

 two tranches will be identical, including, but not limited to, the subscription period and the subscription price. All subscribers participating in the Share Issue will be required to participate with the same amount in each of the two tranches

<<<

.
Bondholders that wish to participate in the Share Issue should contact either of the Arrangers engaged by the Borrower (see section 8 for contact details). Any Bondholder that wishes to exercise its preferential rights to subscribe for Shares

<<<

 in the Share Issue will be required to provide satisfactory proof of ownership to its Bonds to the Arrangers.
5. Shareholdings after the Debt-to-Equity Swap and the Share Issue
5.1. Pre Share Issue
Upon completion of the Debt-to-Equity Swap

<<<

, an aggregate of approximately 677.9 million new Shares will be issued to the Bondholders, resulting in a total of approximately 695.6 million new Shares being outstanding after the Debt-to-Equity Swap, but before completion of the Share Issue

<<<

. The table below shows the shareholdings in the Borrower immediately following the Debt-toEquity Swap based on a 100% conversion of the Loans (as no fractions of Shares will be issued, the final numbers may be subject to minor adjustments)

In addition, the underwriting consortium will receive an aggregate of 35,541,000 warrants, each of which will entitle the holders to subscribe to one new Share at a price of NOK 0.45. The warrants

<<<

 will have a maturity of three years.
As a result of the amount of new Shares being issued as part of the Restructuring, the board has proposed to reduce the number of Shares outstanding by way of a consolidation of Shares. The board thus proposes

<<<

 that immediately following completion of the Restructuring, ten Shares of par value NOK 0.10 shall be consolidated into one new Share of par value NOK 1.00.

6. Evaluation of the Restructuring
6.1. The Borrower's evaluation
The Borrower has

<<<

 continuously been exploring alternatives to secure the required financing for the completion of the construction of the Rig, but has unfortunately not been successful within the available timeframe. Based on feedback from potential sources

<<<

 of financing, the board of the Borrower considers that a restructuring of the Borrower's balance sheet is necessary to facilitate the Borrower's chances of meeting its remaining funding requirements. After having sounded the interest to participate

<<<

 in an equity issue with certain of its principal shareholders and other potential investors, the Borrower has concluded that it will not be feasible to raise equity to repay principal and interest on the Bond Loans with the Borrower's current

<<<

 level of debt.

In the event the Debt-to-Equity Swap is not approved by the Bondholders, the Borrower's financial position suggests that it is likely that the Borrower would have to pursue formal insolvency proceedings. In an insolvency situation

<<<

, the Borrower believes the recovery will be very limited with regards to the Secured Bond, furthermore implying a zero recovery to the holders of First Convertible Bond and the Second Convertible Bond. In an insolvency situation, the amount

<<<

 of repayment to Bondholders in the Secured Bond will depend on the value that can be realized upon the sale of the assets securing the Secured Bond. The current market value of the Rig "as is" is difficult to assess. The combination of large

<<<

 remaining cap ex and remaining construction, makes a sale challenging and would likely require a large discount to contract value. Furthermore, in the Borrower's opinion, there are few potential buyers, if any, with a keen interest in the Rig

<<<

 at the current stage of the construction process. The fact that the existing contract with the yard is only for a fully equipped semi-submersible vessel, not including top-side drilling and well intervention

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA

<<<


WWW. D llN k T .n O

equipment (which equipment has not yet been delivered to the Borrower from its suppliers), may cause the value of the Rig at its current stage of completion to be even less. There will also be risks related to the shipyard

<<<

 in the event of a sale of the construction contract due to the fact that the shipyard has title to the Rig until delivery and is likely to detain the Rig pending payment of compensation for the breach of contract.

Following an exhaustive review

<<<

 of alternatives available to the Borrower, the board has concluded that the Restructuring as proposed will provide the best chances of recovery for all Bondholders and overall represents the best terms that are available to the Borrower to

<<<

 restructure the capital of the Borrower.

6.2. The Loan Trustee's evaluation
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether

<<<

 the proposed Debt-toEquity Swap is acceptable.

Even if the Restructuring is successfully completed, the Borrower will have considerable challenges going forward, and will be dependent on further financing and a contract for the Rig.

It is

<<<

 recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their own financial, legal and tax advisers as to the possible consequences of the Restructuring.

7. Indicative support from Bondholders

As at the date of this summons, the Borrower has received

<<<

 indications from Bondholders representing 67.0% of the Secured Bond, 68.3% of the First Convertible Bond and 99.7% of the Second Convertible Bond that they intend to vote in favour of the Debt-to-Equity Swap.

Situation assessment

m marace

 MARACC has for the last year worked along several tracks to fully finance the remaining

<<<

 unfunded capex requirement of ~USDm 260, however, efforts have proven unsuccessful mainly due to prevailing market conditions and lack of contract
 In response to the challenging situation, MARACC is proposing a solution of an intermediate

<<<

 financing of NOKm 213-360 through a directed equity issue, of which NOKm 213 is fully underwritten
- Underwriting conditional upon acceptance of the restructuring proposal and shareholders' approval - Proposed structure has also been welcomed

<<<

 by key suppliers which have agreed to revised payment schedules
conditional on a successful completion of the proposed restructuring and directed equity issue - Intermediate financing to ensure that construction can continue uninterrupted until

<<<

 4Q 2010
 Subject to new equity capital being raised, MARACC has been able to obtain amended payment schedules from certain key suppliers
 Possibility of entering into a turn-key contract with COSCO for delivery of a complete well intervention

<<<

 and drilling unit currently being explored
- Parallel activities of mechanical completion, commissioning and top-side installation to safeguard schedule - Defer payment of last installment to COSCO - Maintain turn-key responsibility with the

<<<

 yard - considered to be more efficient and reducing integration risks - COSCO has gained experience from top-side installation on Sevan Driller
 Debt restructuring by equitisation of all existing debt required to secure new equity capital


<<<

 MARACC to continue its effort to fully finance the project by end of 2010
- Restructuring believed to further enhance the possibility of addressing the remaining financing requirement through bank debt and / or bond issue

Background and considerations

m marace

 During the last year, MARACC has been working along several

<<<

 tracks to address the remaining financing requirement, including conventional bank and / or bond financing, as well as export credit agencies both in China and Norway
 However, none of these efforts have proven successful in light of the prevailing

<<<

 market conditions, perceived construction risk and lack of contract
 In MARACC's opinion, the only viable alternative is to raise short-term financing enabling MARACC to continue the construction process, and simultaneously continue its efforts

<<<

 to secure a contract and a financing solution for the remaining capex
 In the absence of any short-term financing, the board of directors will be compelled to pursue formal insolvency proceedings
 A potential sale of the project, especially

<<<

 in an insolvency situation, is believed to provide very limited recovery for stakeholders, including the secured bondholders
- Unit still ~2 years away from expected operation start-up - Significant construction work to be completed and financed

<<<


 MARACC firmly believes that the prospects for the highest recovery for all stakeholders is obtained through the proposed restructuring and contemplated directed equity issue, and for MARACC to continue working to obtain a contract and fully

<<<

 finance the project
 Noble Denton retained in February 2010 to provide a technical report assessing the status of the construction process and evaluating the completion date
- Noble Denton provided their report in April 2010; please see appendix

Brief overview of the restructuring proposal*
* PLEASE REFER TO THE SUMMONS DATED 2 JUNE 2010 FOR FURTHER DETAILS (AVAILABLE ON WWW.STAMDATA.NO)

U marace

 Restructuring proposal involves a full

<<<

 conversion of all outstanding bonds (including accrued interest) into equity in order to secure new equity financing - Senior secured bonds; 4.00 new shares issued in exchange for each $1.00 held (incl. accrued interest as per 31-May-10) -

<<<

 Convertible bonds; 1.20 new shares issued in exchange for each $1.00 held (incl. accrued interest as per 31-May-10) - no fractional shares to be issued (rounded down to the nearest whole new share)

 Restructuring proposal subject to certain

<<<

 conditions, including (i) minimum NOKm 213 being raised in new equity capital (gross proceeds) at an issue price of NOK 0.45 per share, (ii) approval of the proposed restructuring by all outstanding bond issues, and (iii) approval by existing

<<<

 shareholders

 Furthermore, provisions relating to mandatory offer obligations (40% ownership threshold) in MARACC's articles of association shall be deleted as part of the proposed restructuring

 All existing stakeholders will be invited

<<<

 to subscribe for their pro rata share of the directed equity issue (based on equity interest post restructuring), avoiding further dilution by such participation

 Senior secured bondholders to have an ownership of ~75% post restructuring

Risk factors

m marace

GENERAL Investing in MARACC involves inherent risks

<<<

. Prospective investors should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out below before making an investment decision. Any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on MARACC's business, financial condition

<<<

 and results of operations and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of any securities issued by MARACC and affect a prospective investor's investment. The information below does not purport to be exhaustive. Additional

<<<

 risks and uncertainties not presently known to MARACC or that MARACC currently deems immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on MARACC's business, financial condition and operating results.
An investment in MARACC is suitable only

<<<

 for investors who understand the risk factors associated with this type of investment and who can afford a loss of all or part of the investment. Such information is presented as of the date hereof and is subject to change, completion or amendment

<<<

 without notice.
OPERATIONAL AND CONSTRUCTION RISK
Construction risks MARACC's only rig is under construction. The construction process is complex and the yard constructing the fully equipped semi-submersible vessel to be used for the rig has

<<<

 limited experience in constructing offshore vessels. The process has already suffered some delays and cost overruns and this is not uncommon for new builds in the industry. Although MARACC is of the opinion that the construction process is

<<<

 under control and should be completed according to the revised schedule without any further increased costs, there can be no assurances that further delays and cost overruns will not occur.
MARACC has entered into fixed priced contracts on

<<<

 a pre-agreed scope in connection with the production of the rig. Should further change orders prove necessary, this may lead to increased costs and/or delays.
Several suppliers will deliver equipment and/or services in connection with the production

<<<

 of the rig. In addition the project will be dependent on a successful integration of different equipment packages and modules. MARACC itself is also responsible for certain parts of the production and utilises sub contractors in this regard

<<<

. Should Ma Ra CC, its suppliers or any other involved party not be able to satisfactory perform their duties under the construction agreements, this may lead to delays or increased costs, which again could have a negative affect on the value

<<<

 of the securities issued by MARACC.
Outsourced management MARACC relies on Island Offshore Management's ability to provide project management and management services to MARACC. Any failure in the provision of these services may have a material

<<<

 adverse impact on MARACC's business and MARACC's financial results and operations. As a consequence of the management agreement, the holders of securities issued by MARACC generally have limited possibilities to participate in and influence

<<<

 the management of MARACC.
Political and regulatory risks Changes in the legislative and fiscal framework governing the activities of the oil companies could have a material impact on exploration and development activity in general and could

<<<

 also affect MARACC's operations directly. In particular, changes in political regimes will constitute a material risk factor for MARACC's operations in foreign countries.
Risk of war, other armed conflicts and terrorist attacks War, military

<<<

 tension and terrorist attacks have caused instability in the world's financial and commercial markets. This has in turn significantly increased political and economic instability in some of the geographic markets in which MARACC operates (or

<<<

 may operate in the future) and has contributed to high levels of volatility in prices for among other things oil and gas. Continuing instability may contribute to even higher level of volatility in prices. In addition, acts of terrorism and

<<<

 threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which MARACC operates (or may operate in the future) could limit or disrupt MARACC's markets and operations, including disruptions from evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts

<<<

 or the loss of personnel or assets.
37

Risk factors (cont'd)

m marace

MARACC may assume substantial liabilities It should be emphasised that contracts in the offshore sector require high standards of safety, and it is important to note

<<<

 that all offshore contracts are associated with considerable risks and responsibilities. These include technical, operational, commercial, financial and political risks. MARACC will obtain insurances deemed adequate for its business, but it

<<<

 is impossible to insure against all applicable risks and liabilities. For instance, under some contracts MARACC may have unlimited liability for losses caused by its own gross negligence, whereas such liability in general will not be covered

<<<

 by insurance policies. MARACC may also incur liability for pollution and other environmental damage without being able to recover said liabilities through insurances.
Service life and technical risks The service life of a new rig is generally

<<<

 assumed to be more than 30 years, but will ultimately depend on its capability. There can be no assurance that MARACC's rigs will be successfully deployed for such period of time. There will always be some exposure to technical risks, with

<<<

 unforeseen operational problems leading to unexpectedly high operating costs and/or lost earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on the financial position of MARACC.
COMMERCIAL RISK
Drilling contracts and employment of rigs Even

<<<

 if MARACC will utilise its current resources in its endeavours to ensure that charter agreements with customers are secured for the rig, no such charter agreement has yet been secured and no assurances can be given that MARACC will be sufficiently

<<<

 successful in deploying its rig. A delay or failure in obtaining a contract for the rig may have a material adverse impact on the financial position of MARACC.
There is often considerable uncertainty as to the duration of offshore drilling

<<<

 contracts because the agreements may give the operator both extension and early cancellation options. There can also be off-hire periods between contracts. The cancellation or postponement of one or more contracts can have a material adverse

<<<

 impact on the earnings of drilling companies, including MARACC.
Oil prices Historically, demand for offshore exploration, development and production has been volatile and closely linked to the price of hydrocarbons. Low oil prices typically

<<<

 lead to a reduction in exploration drilling as the oil companies scale down their investment budgets. The sharp reduction in production costs on new oil fields and the increase in the use of drilling rigs for production drilling will probably

<<<

 to some extent reduce the strong historical correlation between rig rates and oil prices. Nevertheless, a decrease in the oil and gas prices may have a material adverse impact on the financial position of MARACC.
Limited operating history MARACC

<<<

 is a relatively recently formed entity and has limited operating history and only financial information for a limited period of time upon which prospective investors can evaluate MARACC's future performance.
Concentration MARACC has no restrictions

<<<

 relating to the diversification or concentration of its assets. However, as MARACC's assets are concentrated in a single industry, MARACC may be more vulnerable to particular economic, political, regulatory, environmental or other developments

<<<

 than a company holding a more diversified portfolio of assets, and the aggregate return of MARACC will be substantially adversely affected by unfavourable performance of its assets.
Intellectual property rights MARACC must observe third parties

<<<

' patent rights and intellectual rights. There is always an inherent risk of third parties claiming that the technology being utilised in the construction of MARACC's rigs or in its operations infringes third parties' patents or intellectual

<<<

 property rights, and any such claim, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on MARACC's results of operation.
38

Risk factors (cont'd)

m marace

FINANCIAL RISK
Funding of MARACC's rig MARACC has not yet obtained all the funding

<<<

 required for MARACC's investments in the rig and further substantial financing will be necessary in the future. Should MARACC not succeed in obtaining financing on satisfactory terms, this may adversely affect the value of an investor's investments

<<<

.
Interest rate and currency fluctuations MARACC will be exposed to risks due to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates. MARACC may attempt to minimise these risks by implementing hedging arrangements as appropriate, but will not be able

<<<

 to avoid these risks. Since MARACC's financial reporting is in NOK, while the income and expenses of MARACC are primarily in USD, currency fluctuations may influence the value of any securities issued by MARACC. The value of non-NOK currency

<<<

 denominated charter contracts and indebtedness will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations. Currency exchange rates are determined by forces of supply and demand in the currency exchange markets. These

<<<

 forces are affected by the international balance of payments, economic and financial conditions, government intervention, speculation and other factors. Changes in currency exchange rates relative to NOK may affect the NOK value of MARACC's

<<<

 assets and thereby impact upon MARACC's total return on such assets. Currency fluctuations relative to NOK of an investor's currency of reference may adversely affect the value of an investor's investments.
Borrowing and leverage Borrowings

<<<

 create leverage. To the extent income derived from assets obtained with borrowed funds exceeds the interest and other expenses that MARACC will have to pay, MARACC's net income will be greater than if borrowings were not made. Conversely, if

<<<

 the income from the assets obtained with borrowed funds is not sufficient to cover the cost of such borrowings, the net income of MARACC will be less than if borrowings were not made. MARACC will borrow only when it believes that such borrowings

<<<

 will benefit MARACC after taking into account considerations such as the costs of the borrowings and the likely returns on the assets purchased with the borrowed monies, but no assurances can be given that MARACC will be successful in this

<<<

 respect.
RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY MARACC
Investment and trading risks in general Any investment in securities issued by MARACC is associated with an element of risk. MARACC operates in a market featuring open and fierce

<<<

 competition, and a number of factors outside MARACC's control may affect its performance. The price of the securities will also be subject to fluctuations in line with general movements in the capital markets and the liquidity in the secondary

<<<

 market. Historically, the earnings of offshore service companies and the value of the equipment used have seen major fluctuations.
Price volatility of publicly traded securities The shares issued by MARACC are not listed on any stock exchange

<<<

 or similar market, and no plans currently exist to apply for any such listing. Although the shares have been registered on the Norwegian OtC market, there is no assurance that investors can realize any part of the value of their investments

<<<

. In addition, the liquidity and the market price of the shares may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for similar securities, MARACC's financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in its industry

<<<

 generally.
