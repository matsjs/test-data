 Unsecured Bond Issue 2010/2013

Oslo, 24 June 2013
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting regarding request for certain temporary waivers of gearing ratio covenants
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("Norsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee (the "Bond Trustee") for

<<<

 the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above bond issue (the "NOR05 Bond" or the "Bond") with Norwegian Energy Company ASA as issuer (the "Company", "Noreco" or the "Issuer"). The Bond is a NOK 700 million bond issue with ISIN NO 001 0

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 1 December 2010, as amended (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer

 is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 INTRODUCTION
The Company has taken important steps in addressing its financial position and capital structure through

<<<

 the recent equity issue and two new bond issues. Through 2013, the Company expects to make significant reductions in debt level and optimize the debt portfolio, driven both by cash flow from operations and the special tax refund of NOK 722

<<<

.7 million plus interest from discontinuation of the petroleum activities in the parent company, which will be refunded as part of the ordinary tax refund in December. This tax refund has been pre-approved by Norwegian tax authorities, and was

<<<

 in April finally claimed as part of the ordinary tax reporting for the Company.
Both the ordinary tax refund and this tax refund from discontinuation of the petroleum activities on parent level are expected to be refunded on or about 20 December

<<<

 2013. Given the maturity of the NOR05 Bond on 6 December 2013, there may be a liquidity gap of approximately 14 days, between receipt of such tax funds and the repayment date of the Bonds.
On the above basis, Noreco wishes to put forward a

<<<

 request to the Bondholders for a short extension of the Maturity Date in the NOR05 Bond in order to bridge any such potential cash shortfall. As compensation for such amendment, Noreco offers a fee to the Bondholders upon approval in the Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting to be held in the Bond.

PROPOSAL

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

2.1 Extension Proposal

<<<



In accordance with Clause 16.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Company has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting for the Bond in order to consider the Company's request for an extension of the Maturity Date, pursuant to

<<<

 the authority given to the Bondholders' Meeting under Clause 16.1 of the Bond Agreement.

Specifically, the Company proposes the following maturity extension (the "Extension Proposal"):

The Maturity Date shall be extended to 30 December 2

<<<

013, by amending the definition o f "Maturity Date" in the Bond Agreement to read as follows: "Maturity Date means 30 December 2013. Any further adjustment may be made according to the Business Day Convention."

2.2 Compensation Fee

As a compensation

<<<

 to the Bondholders for approving the Extension Proposal, the Company offers the Bondholders a one-time compensation fee of 0.25% (flat) of the face value of the Bonds, payable to the Bondholders (with record date on the end of business on the

<<<

 date of the Bondholders' Meeting) within ten (10) Business Days after the Bondholders' Meetings for the Bonds, provided that such Bondholder Meeting adopts the Extension Proposal with sufficient majority.

In the Company's opinion, the compensation

 fee offered to the Bondholders as a compensation for the extension is a fair and balanced proposal based on the short extension and the expected cash position taking into account the tax refunds to be received.
