Delphin Kreuzfahrten GmbH - summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Background
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee for the above mentioned bond issue (the "Loan") where Delphin Kreuzfahrten GmbH is the issuer (the "Company

<<<

").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement dated 27 February 2007 (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated.
The Loan is a fixed rate callable first lien bond issue with a coupon

<<<

 of 9.25 % p.a. Remaining Loan amount is NOK 120 million. The Loan is secured by i.a. the cruise ship MV Delphin (the "Vessel"). As informed to the Bondholders, the Company faces liquidity problems, and matured instalments and interest payments

<<<

 are not paid.
Reference is made to the notice from the Bondholders' meeting on 11 September 2008 whereas i.a it was decided that sale of the Vessel should be initiated, alternatively other acceptable solutions should be found.
According to

<<<

 information from the Company, it is not in position to redeem in full the Loan to day, or serve the Loan as scheduled. Any proceeds to the bondholders will be distributed from sale of the Vessel or similar solutions
The Company has been in

<<<

 negotiations with an Indian party willing to buy 70 % of the shares in the Company. The condition for the transaction is that the Loan is redeemed in full and the mortgage over the Vessel and any other security for the Loan are released. The

<<<

 price for the shares are  13 000 000 which will be part of the full redemption for the Bonds. In Addition comes the amount of 250 000 previously transferred to the escrow account. In total this corresponds to  13 250 000, which will be offered

<<<

 as the final settlement of the Loan.
The Company has appointed Feamleys Fonds ASA ("Fearnleys") as their financial advisors. The Loan Trustee and Feamleys have appointed a German shipbroker to find buyers for the Vessel. It has not been possible

<<<

 to find bona fide buyers who would pay an amount equal to the proceeds which will arise from the deal with the Indian party. Neither does it seem that a forced sale of the Vessel nor a bankruptcy of the Company will give a higher outcome.

In this situation, the offered sum of  13 250 000 for redemption of the Loan, is, in the Company's opinion the best solution they can offer the Bondholders. The request from the Company is put forward to the Bondholders without further

<<<

 evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed redemption offer are acceptable.
In this respect, the Company's proposal corresponds to a price of approximate 91 % per cent

<<<

 (based on exchange rate of EURNOK of 8.26) of the principal amount outstanding. (However, any cost for the Loan Trustee will be deducted pro rata between the bonds, as also decided on the last Bondholders' meeting.). This is, in the Company

<<<

's opinion the best solution they can offer the Bondholders.
The settlement procedure may be conducted as a discharge of the bonds or that the bonds will be transferred to the Indian buyer as new Bondholders, or any other way the Loan Trustee

<<<

 deems to be most appropriate. The settlement will be conducted as soon as practicably possible, however no later than November 15 2008.
