The rate of interest payable in respect of each Interest Period (the "Rate of Interest") will be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions, on the second Oslo Business

<<<

 Day (as defined below) prior to the commencement of each Interest Period (each, an "Interest Determination Date"):
(i) The Calculation Agent will ascertain the offered rate for three-month Norwegian Kroner deposits in the Oslo interbank market

<<<

 which appears on the Reuters Page NIBR as at 12:00 noon (Oslo time) on such Interest Determination Date. The Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be the rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate so determined by the Calculation

<<<

 Agent and the Margin (as defined below).
(ii) If the offered rate so appearing is replaced by the corresponding rates of more than one bank then subparagraph (i) shall be applied, with any necessary consequential changes, to the arithmetic

<<<

 mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the fifth decimal place) of the rates (being at least two) which so appear as determined by the Calculation Agent. If for any other reason such offered rate does not appear on the Reuters Page NIBR, or

<<<

 if the Reuters Page NIBR is unavailable, the Calculation Agent will request each of the banks whose offered rates would have been used for the purposes of the relevant page if the event leading to the application of this sub-paragraph (ii)

<<<

 had not happened or the principal Oslo office o f each of four major banks in the Oslo interbank market as selected by the Calculation Agent (the "Reference Banks") to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation (expressed as a

<<<

 rate per annum) for three- month Norwegian Kroner deposits to leading banks in the Oslo interbank market at approximately 12:00 noon (Oslo lime) on the Interest Determination Date in question. The Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall

<<<

 be the rate per annum equal to the sum of the arithmetic mean (rounded as aforesaid if necessary) of such offered quotations, as determined by the Calculation Agent, and the Margin.
(iii) If on any Interest Determination Date two or more but

<<<

 not all o f the Reference Banks provide the Calculation Agent with such quotations, the Rate of Interest for the relevant Interest Period shall be determined in accordance with sub-paragraph (ii) above on the basis of the quotations of those

<<<

 Reference Banks providing such quotations.
(iv) If on any Interest Determination Date one only or none of the Reference Banks provides the Calculation Agent with such offered quotations, the Rate of Interest for the relevant Interest Period

<<<

 shall be the rate per annum which tile Calculation Agent determined to be the sum of the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the fifth decimal place) of the lowest Norwegian Kroner offered rates which four major banks in Oslo selected

<<<

 by the Calculation Agent are quoting at approximately 12:00 noon (Oslo time) on such Interest Determination Date to leading European banks for a period of three months, and the Margin.
For the purposes hereof:
"Margin" means 4.00 per cent,

<<<

 per annum, in the case of Interest Periods ending before the Initial Call Date or 5.00 per cent, per annum in the case of Interest Periods ending after the Initial Call Date.
"Reuters Page NIBR" means the display designated as page no. NIBR

<<<

 on Reuters (or such other replacement page on that service for the purpose, inter alia, of displaying Oslo interbank offered rates for Norwegian Kroner deposits).
The Calculation Agent wilt, as soon as practicable after 12:00 noon (Oslo time

<<<

) on each Interest Determination Date, determine the Rate of Interest and calculate the amount of interest (the "Interest Amount") payable for the relevant Interest Period. The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Rate o f Interest

<<<

 to the principal amount of the Capital Securities, multiplying such product by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest Øre (half an Øre being rounded upwards

<<<

). The determination of the Rate o f Interest and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding upon all parties.
Where the Capital Securities are to be redeemed pursuant to "Redemption

<<<

 and Repurchase", Accrued Interest for the period ending on but excluding the due date of redemption shall be calculated as provided in "Optional Redemption" below.

 Securities as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Oslo Business Day thereafter. The notification of any rate or amount, if applicable, shall be made to the VPS in accordance with and subject to the

<<<

 VPS rules and regulations for the time being in effect.
If for any reason at any relevant time the Calculation Agent defaults in its obligation to determine the Rate of Interest, the VPS Trustee shall determine the Rate o f Interest at such

<<<

 rate as, in its absolute discretion (having such regard as it shall think fit to the foregoing provisions of this Condition), it shall deem fair and reasonable in all the circumstances or, as the case may be, the VPS Trustee shall calculate

<<<

 the Interest Amount in such manner as it shall deem fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and each such determination or calculation shall be deemed to have been made by the Calculation Agent.
All certificates, communications, opinions

<<<

, determinations, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this part "Calculation of Interest Rate", by the Calculation Agent, shall (in the absence of wilful default, bad

<<<

 faith or manifest error) be binding on all parties and (in the absence as aforesaid) no liability shall attach to the Calculation Agent or the VPS Trustee (if applicable) in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by it of its powers,

<<<

 duties and discretions pursuant to such provisions.
The Issuer shall procure that there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent for so long as any Capital Security is outstanding. If the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to act as

<<<

 such or if the Calculation Agent fails duly to establish the Rate of Interest for an Interest Period or to calculate any Interest Amount or to comply with any other requirement, the Issuer shall (with the prior approval of the VPS Trustee)

<<<

 appoint a leading bank or investment banking firm engaged in the Oslo interbank market to act as such in its place. The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties without a successor having been appointed as aforesaid.
Interest accruing after

 the due date for redemption in certain circumstances
Each Capital Security will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused, in which case it will continue to bear interest

Sufficiency o fAvailable Distributable Funds and interest payment restriction

<<<

<<<

 accrued but unpaid interest under the Capital Securities and any Parity Securities (in each case falling due on that Interest Payment Date), the Issuer will make partial payment of all accrued but unpaid interest under the Capital Securities

<<<

 and such Parity Securities pro rata to the extent of such Available Distributable Funds. If, and to the extent that, Available Distributable Funds are insufficient or non-existent and the Issuer makes partial payment of, or does not pay, accrued

<<<

 but unpaid interest, the right of the holders of the Capital Securities to receive accrued but unpaid interest in respect o f the relevant Interest Period will be lost. The Issuer will have no obligation to make such payments of unpaid interest

<<<

 or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned for any purpose.
Subject to the availability of

<<<

 payable on any Interest Payment Date which is not an Optional Interest Payment Date. Any interest in respect of the Capital Securities not paid on an Interest Payment Date, together with any other interest in respect thereof not paid on any

<<<

 other Interest Payment Date, shall (save where cancelled as described in "Sufficiency o fAvailable Distributable Funds and interest payment restriction"), so long as the same remains unpaid, constitute "Arrears of Interest" .
