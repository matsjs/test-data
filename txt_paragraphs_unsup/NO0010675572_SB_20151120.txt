ISIN: NO 001 067557.2 - "3mN+6.75 per cent Western Bulk Senior Unsecured Bond Issue

<<<

 2013/2017"
Oslo, 20 November 2015
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Trustee") for the holders of the Bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue with ISIN NO 001 067557.2 (the "Bond Issue

<<<

") issued by Western Bulk ASA (the "Issuer" or the "Company").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 17 April 2013 and amended 15 August 2014, made between the Trustee and the Issuer

<<<

 (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. References to Clauses and paragraphs are references to Clauses and paragraphs of the Bond Agreement.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided

<<<

 by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 BACKGROUND
Following a period with continuously challenging diy bulk market, the Company's revenues have been negatively affected

<<<

 over a long period of time. This has also affected the Company's book equity and cash position. As of 30 September 2015, Western Bulk had an adjusted equity of USD 50.9 million and an adjusted equity ratio of 28.6%. This is close to the financial

<<<

 covenant thresholds as set out in the Bond Agreement of minimum book equity of USD 50 million and a minimum book equity ratio of 25.00%. The Company expects to be in breach with these covenants on or about the next Calculation Date, 31 December

<<<

 2015.
The Company's business is divided into two business segments; WB Chartering and WB Shipholding. WB Chartering is delivering decent results despite the current market conditions. However, with an average charter-in rate of USD 13,500 per

<<<

 day on the Japanese leases in WB Shipholding, the Shipholding division is facing a negative margin. The Supramax spot rates are currently averaging a TC-equivalent of about USD 7,300/day (year-to-date 30 October 2015). The Company expects low

<<<

 rates to continue for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016.

2/12
The Company is however more optimistic with respect to its financial prospects from 2017 and onwards. This is due to the fact that the current downturn in the rates to a large

<<<

 extent is driven by an oversupply of new vessels that have been ordered in previous years, and rates have declined as the net fleet growth has been larger than the demand growth for transportation. The delivery of new vessels currently on order

<<<

 will continue in 2016, and the expected net fleet growth for 2016 is more or less equal to the expected demand growth. Consequently, low rates are expected also for 2016, but from 2017 the delivery of new vessels is expected to decline as very

<<<

 few new orders have been placed during 2015 for delivery in 2017 and onwards. Hence, the market balance is expected to start improving from 2017 unless the demand growth becomes very weak, or significant orders for new vessels are being placed

<<<

.
The Company is currently working on several arrangements and initiatives to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce its financial obligations going forward:
The Company is contemplating to raise the NOK equivalent to USD 15 million of new

<<<

 equity, subject to necessary corporate resolutions including approval by the extraordinary general meeting by requisite majority (the "Equity Issue").
The Company's single largest shareholder, Kistefos AS, has undertaken to guarantee and subscribe

<<<

 for an amount of USD 10 million in the Equity Issue, subject to the Proposal being accepted by the Bondholders' meeting. This is governed by a separate subscription and guarantee agreement between the Company and Kistefos AS, as further described

<<<

 in the Company's announcement on 20 November 2015. Under the guarantee agreement, Kistefos AS has also undertaken a lock-up on its shareholding in the Company until completion of the equity transaction and undertaken to vote in favour of the

<<<

 proposal for the equity transaction at the extraordinary general meeting. The implementation of the Proposal shall also be subject to evidence satisfactory to the Trustee that the subscription and guarantee agreement between Kistefos AS and

<<<

 Western Bulk ASA has been executed.
In WB Shipholding, the Issuer has already obtained agreement with counterparties for some of the Japanese leases giving rate reductions of about USD 1.5 million for 2016 and 1H17 against a similar rate increase

<<<

 paid in the following two years. The Issuer is in or is about to launch discussions with the other lease counterparties with the aim to achieve a further substantial rate reduction for 2016 and 2017. Also for the rest of the Japanese leases

<<<

, the Issuer expects that a subsequent rate increase for the years following 2017 is needed in order to be able to achieve the targeted rate reductions for 2016 and 2017.
The Company is also focused on margin improvement and operational cost

<<<

 cutting. During the last year, the following has been done:
o Significantly increased contract coverage for WB Chartering to reduce earnings risk.
o WB Chartering has seen a sharply improved base margin so far in 2015, and has also successfully

<<<

 achieved rate reductions on some of its chartered-in tonnage for 2016 and 2017.
o WB Chartering's Panamax business unit has been closed.
o A more efficient and improved vessel management system has been launched including upgraded routines

<<<

 and policies to work smarter and more efficient.
o Strengthened counterpart vetting, approval and monitoring procedures to have even tighter control of counterparty risk in a veiy challenging market environment.
o Headcount has been reduced

<<<

 from 130 to 112 currently and reduced office space in Oslo by 20%.
o Cost cutting program for bunker procurement, legal cost, consultancy cost etc.

3/12
o Through cost cutting and the weakening of the USD against the NOK, the Issuer's G&A

<<<

 is expected to decline by USD 7.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015.
2 PROPOSAL AND RATIONALE
In accordance with Clause 16.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting in order to obtain

<<<

 the Bondholders' approval to the proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement as described below, pursuant to the authority given to the Bondholders' Meeting under Clause 16.3 of the Bond Agreement.
The Issuer proposes the following (the "Proposal

<<<

"):
2.1 Amend the financial covenants in clause 13.7.1 as follows:
The Book Equity Ratio is proposed to be reduced to minimum 20% on a permanent basis for the Group (the current threshold is 25%, and is increasing to 30% from April 2016);
The

<<<

 minimum Book Equity Amount is proposed to be reduced to minimum USD 30 million for the Group on a permanent basis (the current threshold is USD 50 million);
The minimum Liquidity amount is proposed to be increased from USD 10 million to USD

<<<

 20 million for the Group. However, the amount shall be reduced if the Company buys back its own Bonds. The minimum Liquidity amount shall be reduced with the corresponding par value amount of the Issuer's Bonds being bought back and based on

<<<

 a NOKUSD FX of 6.06 which is the average FX swap rate that the Company has in place for the principal Bond amount (i.e. if the Company buys back USD 3 million of principal amount Bonds, then the minimum Liquidity amount shall be reduced to

<<<

 USD 17 million). The minimum Liquidity amount shall however never he less than USD 10 million; and
the Gearing Ratio is proposed to be removed on a permanent basis (currently maximum 3.75x for the Group).
Rationale: By issuing USD 15 million

<<<

 o f new equity, equalling approximately 40% o f the current market capitalization o f the Issuer, Western Bulk will strengthen its balance sheet considerably. The guaranteed amount o f USD 10 millionfrom the majority shareholder sends a strong

<<<

 signal in terms o f willingness to support the Issuer. This guaranteed amount equals Kistefos 'pro rata share o f USD 15 million (approx. USD 9.1 million) plus an additional approx. USD 0.9 million (subject to pro-rata allocation principles

<<<

 in accordance with the Norwegian Public Limited Company's act). In addition to the equity injection, the targeted modification on the Japanese leases and operational cost cutting will, if obtained, reduce cash outflow over the next two years

<<<

 significantly.
More flexibility on the financial covenants is however needed as the dry bulk market is expected to remain challenging through 2016. It is importantfor the Issuer's day to day business to avoid noise with respect to funding and

<<<

 covenant situation, and potential repeating covenant breaches are therefore unfortunate. The new covenant levels will allow the Issuer to operate within reasonable limits at the same time as the Bondholders'position is protected. With respects

<<<

 to the Gearing Ratio, the Company proposes to remove this covenant as EBITDA is negative, and expected to be negative throughout the tenor o f the Bonds, hence the covenant gives no meaning.
To ensure that the Company maintains free liquidity

<<<

 it has agreed to increase the Minimum Liquidity amount from USD 10 million to USD 20 million. The buy-back allowance will encourage the

4/12
Company to acquire Bonds in the market which will further reduce the amount o f Bonds to be refinanced

<<<

 at maturity,
2.2 Increase the frequency of covenant testing from semi-annually to quarterly
Today the financial statements of the Issuer are reported to the Bond Trustee semi-annually and the financial covenants are thus tested on a semi-annual

<<<

 basis. It is proposed that reporting and testing is done on a quarterly basis. The proposal implies that covenants shall apply at all times, be tested on the last day of each quarter and that the financial statements shall be reported within

<<<

 60 days after the end of each quarter, except for the annual financial statements which will be reported within 90 days after the end of the calendar year. In respect of the Minimum Book Equity Ratio, it is proposed that the Issuer will need

<<<

 to be in breach on the end of two consecutive quarters in order to be in default under the Bond Agreement.
Rationale: It is deemed that an increase o f the frequency o f reporting and testing financial covenants from a semi-annual basis to

<<<

 a quarterly basis will increase the transparency and further improve the Bondholders 'ability to monitor thefinancial state o f the Issuer.
2.3 No dividends or other distributions shall be allowed prior to final Maturity Date
No dividends,

<<<

 share buy-back or other distributions shall be allowed until final Maturity Date.
2.4 Company not to sell its own Bonds
The Company agrees not to sell nor discharge or cancel, until the Bonds mature, the Bonds it currently holds on its books

<<<

 amounting to NOK 29 million in par value. The same shall apply for any other Bonds acquired by the Group in the future.

5/12
2.5 New events to be included as an Event of Default
2.5.1 Failure to get approval on the extiAaordinary general

<<<

 meeting by 31 March 2016
It shall be an event of default if the extraordinary general meeting of the Company fails to approve the Equity Issue of the NOK equivalent to USD 15 million by 31 March 2016. As the equity issue will be in NOK, the

<<<

 NOK amount shall be based on the Norwegian Central Banks official exchange rate for NOK/USD on the date the board meeting approving the summons to the extraordinary general meeting (the "Exchange Rate").
2.5.2 Failure to allocate minimum USD

<<<

 10 million o f equity within 31 March 2016
It shall be an event of default if the Company fails to allocate shares for an amount of minimum the NOK equivalent to USD 10 million in the Equity Issue within 31 March 2016. As the equity issue will

<<<

 be in NOK, the NOK amount shall be based on the Exchange Rate.
2.6 Consequence if the Company fails to raise USD 15 million of Subordinated Capital
From the date of the Bondholder's Meeting approving the Proposal until the Company has allocated

<<<

 the NOK equivalent to USD 15 million of Subordinated Capital (Subordinated Capital to be defined as a combination of (a) the NOK equivalent to USD 10 million of guaranteed equity and (b) either (i) further equity or (ii) one or several fully

<<<

 subordinated loan(s)), the Group may not draw on any Credit Facility (as defined in the Bond Agreement). Such subordinated loans may be granted by Kistefos AS or any other related party. As the Equity Issue will be in NOK, the NOK amount shall

<<<

 be based on the Exchange Rate.
If the company fails to allocate the NOK equivalent to USD 15 million of Subordinated Capital by 31 March 2016 (based on the Exchange Rate), all Credit Facilities shall be terminated and no further Credit Facilities

<<<

 shall be established until after the maturity of the Bond and any security granted under any Credit Facility shall cease to exist.
For avoidance of doubt, the limitation above shall not limit the Issuer and the Chartering Group to establish

<<<

 customary set off arrangements, security over accounts receivables, bank accounts and/or cash securing bid bonds, performance bonds and bonds in connection with disputed claims, always provided that the amount of such security shall not exceed

<<<

 USD 10 million (which is in accordance with the existing Bond Agreement).
2.7 Amendment fee
As compensation to the Bondholders, the Issuer offers the Bondholders a one-time amendment fee of 1.00% (flat) of the Face Value of the Bonds, payable

<<<

 to the Bondholders registered in the VPS end-ofbusiness the date of the Bondholders' Meeting, within 10 Business Days after the Bondholders' Meeting, provided that the Bondholders' Meeting approves the proposed changes as set out in Clause

<<<

 2 of this summons.
The Proposal has been detailed in the Appendix to this summons where the proposed changes to the relevant clauses of the Bond Agreement have been set out.

6/12
3 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
3.1 The Issuer's evaluation

<<<


In the Issuer's opinion, the proposed amendments, together with the above mentioned initiatives, will maintain the Bondholders' position as creditor. The Issuer believes the proposed Equity Issue, the one-time waiver fee and the structural

<<<

 amendments together should be a fair compensation for the Bondholders to accept the Proposal.
The Issuer has engaged Pareto Securities AS as its financial advisor (the "Advisor") with respect to the Proposal. Accordingly, Bondholders may contact

<<<

 Pareto Securities AS Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70 for further information.

<<<

 related to such information givenfrom the Issuer.
