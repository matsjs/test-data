 described above issued by Thule Drilling AS (in bankruptcy ) (the "Company"). Following the event of default declared 13 March 2009, NTM has, based on its general power to safeguard the common interests derived from and in connection with the

 bond agreement taken various actions against the Company, pursued security rights, including the mortgages against the drilling rigs and equipment, the guarantee claims, and pursued claims for damages against inter alia members of the former

 board of directors of the Company. The Bondholders' meeting 30 March 2011 resolved that bondholders holding no less than a majority of the First Lien Bonds (the ad-hoc committee) at any given time could instruct the Loan Trustee in relation

 to the recovery. The ad-hoc committee specifically confirmed and approved of its support to the Loan Trustee's intention and decision to pursue recovery through legal proceedings against the former board members et al. on 14 April 2011. NTM

 filed the writ 14 April 2011 (case no. F2011-033684 Oslo Conciliation Board, case no. 11-164647TVI-OTIR/04 before the Oslo District Court, case no. 13-068997ASK-BORG/04). Subsequently, the defendants have contested the legal authority for NTM

<<<

 to pursue these claims for damages derived from actions linked to the loan and security interest. The defendants have also questioned whether the decision to take legal actions is appropriately and correctly resolved by the bondholders. Following

<<<

 the above, to avoid the alleged doubt, a Bondholders' meeting is convened to request the bondholders to confirm NTM's authority and the bondholders' legal position relating thereto.
