 EMS Seven Seas ASA Senior Unsecured Callable Bond Issue 2011/2014" with ISIN NO 001 062793.8 (the "Bond Issue"), whereby EMS Seven Seas ASA (the "Company") is the issuer.
All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this summons

<<<

 (the "Summons") shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the agreement (as amended) for the Bond Issue (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this Summons regarding the Company and market conditions is provided by the Company, and the

<<<

 Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 BACKGROUND AND CORPORATE UPDATE Based on the Company's current operations, financial position and cash flow as further described in the Company's unaudited

<<<

 Q4 2013 report published on 25 February 2014, the Company deems it necessary to restructure its balance sheet by reducing the Company's outstanding debt and payment obligations.
The Company is therefore contemplating to convene a general meeting

<<<

, scheduled to be held on or about 22 May 2014 (the "General Meeting"), with the proposal to resolve a share issue directed towards the Company's shareholders against consideration in cash or, to the extent subscription is made by Bondholders

<<<

, by bonds in the Bond Issue (the "Bonds"), combined with a right for the Company to convert remaining Bonds into shares, as further described below (the "Share Issue").
The Share Issue will have gross proceeds of up to approximately NOK 21

<<<

8.4 million and a subscription price of NOK 2 per share, which shall be payable in cash or with Bonds. Eligible shareholders of the Company as at close of trading on Oslo Børs on the date of the General Meeting will be granted tradable subscription

<<<

 rights in the Share Issue. The cash proceeds from the Share Issue will be used to repay Bonds. The Trustee, for and on behalf of the Bondholders, shall be allocated any shares not subscribed for by other subscribers in the Share Issue, by the

<<<

Bonds

<<<

 at par value with shares in the Company (or, as the case may be, in cash). The Trustee's obligation to subscribe for shares in the Share Issue, for and on behalf of the Bondholders, shall be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid any Bondholder

<<<

 triggering a mandatory offer obligation under the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
Based on preliminary estimates of the abovementioned limitation, the Company assumes that minimum NOK 184 million of the Bond Issue will be repaid or converted

<<<

 into shares in the Share Issue. After completion of the Share Issue, any remaining part of the Bond Issue shall be amended into standardized bilateral loan agreement(s) between the Company and the relevant bondholder(s), with inter alia a term

<<<

 of four years (maturity in October 2018) and a fixed interest rate of approximately 5%.
The Share Issue is expected to be carried out in May/June 2014, subject to necessary corporate resolutions and approval of a prospectus for the Share Issue

<<<

.
In order to facilitate that the Company has sufficient financing for the coming 12 months according to the current plan for operations, the Company is dependent on carrying out the Share Issue, that accrued interest under the Bond Agreement

<<<

 is waived, and that accrual of interest going forward until maturity of the Bond Issue is waived. On this basis, the Company requests the Bondholders to (i) waive all accrued and not paid interest under the Bond Agreement, (ii) waive all accrual

<<<

 of interest under the Bond Agreement going forward until the maturity of the Bond Issue, (iii) waive the 1% premium on the Company's call option under the Bond Agreement resulting in a call option at 100% of par value, and (iv) allow for the

<<<

 Company to choose to repay Bonds at par value with payment in kind in the form of shares in the Company through the Share Issue.
The Company has received letters of undertaking from certain Bondholders representing approximately 98% of the

<<<

 Bonds (the "Majority Bondholders") regarding the adoption of the Proposal. The Company has also received undertakings from the Majority Bondholders representing approximately 82% of the share capital of the Company to vote in favour of the

<<<

 Share Issue at the General Meeting.
For further details and Company update, reference is made to (i) stock exchange notices on www.newsweb.no under the ticker symbol "EMS", and (ii) the Company's unaudited Q4 2013 report published on 25 February

<<<

 2014. The Bondholders are encouraged to review such information and, if necessary, consult with the Company for any further details.
2 PROPOSAL The Company has resolved to propose (the "Proposal") that the bondholders' meeting adopts the necessary

<<<

 resolutions in order to amend the Bond Agreement to ensure that:
(a) all rights to receive interest under the Bond Issue:
(i) accrued and unpaid as at the date of the bondholders' meeting; and
(ii) from the date of the bondholders' meeting

<<<

,
are permanently waived;

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
(b) the Company shall be entitled to call all remaining outstanding amounts under the Bonds by either, or a combination of,:
(i) payment in cash at 100% of par value; or
(ii) payment

<<<

 in kind at 100% of par value by conversion of Bonds and delivery of new shares in the Company through the Share Issue, calculated based on the total number of Bonds held by each holder of Bonds rounded down to the nearest even number, provided

<<<

 that, no Bondholder shall be under an obligation to convert any Bonds to shares in the Company to the extent that such conversion would result in such Bondholder triggering a mandatory offer obligation under the Norwegian Securities Trading

<<<

 Act, in which case the relevant Bondholder shall convert a relatively smaller proportion of its Bonds to shares; and
(c) the Bondholders:
(1) instruct the Trustee (in consultation with its advisors) to do all things and take such steps on behalf

<<<

 of the Bondholders as may be necessary or desirable in connection with the implementation of the Proposal as described in the Summons, including, without limitation:
(i) to, for and on behalf of the Bondholders, subscribe for shares in the

<<<

 Company in the Share Issue as a prepayment of Bonds with payment-in kind in the form of shares in the Company; and
(ii) to take any and all other steps and actions expressly or impliedly required to be taken or that it would be desirable to

<<<

 take in order to implement the Proposal, including, without limitation, negotiating, documenting and entering into legal agreements, granting amendments and waivers and giving instructions, consents, approvals and directions, as contemplated

<<<

 by the Summons;
(2) agree that the Trustee may at its discretion consent to amendments to the terms of the Proposal on behalf of the Bondholders where such amendments (i) are of a minor or technical nature, (ii) are otherwise consistent with

<<<

 the Proposal and are required in order to implement the Proposal, or (iii) would not adversely affect the position of the Bondholders;
(3) agree that the Trustee may exercise (or refuse to exercise) any discretion, consent or approval required

<<<

 or contemplated in connection with the matters referred to in the Proposal; and
(4) agree that the Trustee shall have no liability whatsoever to any Bondholder or any other person in connection with the exercise (or non-exercise) of any such

<<<

 discretion which is exercised in good faith.
