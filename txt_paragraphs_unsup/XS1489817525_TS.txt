In particular, in June 2015, the FCA published the Product Intervention (Contingent Convertible Instruments and Mutual Society Shares) Instrument

<<<

 2015, which took effect from 1 October 2015 (the "PI Instrument"). Under the rules set out in the PI Instrument (as amended or replaced from time to time, the "PI Rules"), certain contingent write-down or convertible securities (including any

<<<

 beneficial interests therein), such as the Notes, must not be sold to retail clients in the EEA, and there must not be any communication or approval of an invitation or inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite such securities (or

<<<

 the beneficial interest in such securities) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the EEA (in each case, within the meaning of the PI Rules)

<<<

 client in the EEA (as defined in the PI Rules);

(A) sell or offer the Notes (or any beneficial interest therein) to retail clients in the EEA; or
(B) communicate (including the

<<<

 distribution of this document) or approve an invitation or inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a way

<<<

 that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the PI Rules),
in any such case other than (i) in relation to any sale or offer to sell the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein) to a

<<<

 retail client in or resident in the United Kingdom, in circumstances that do not and will not give rise to a contravention of the PI Rules by any person and/or (ii) in relation to any sale or offer to sell the Notes (or any beneficial interests

<<<

 therein) to a retail client in any EEA member state other than the United Kingdom, where (a) it has conducted an assessment and concluded that the relevant retail client understands the risks of an investment in the Notes (or such beneficial

<<<

 interests therein) and is able to bear the potential losses involved in an investment in the Notes (or such beneficial interests therein) and (b) it has at all times acted in relation to such sale or offer in compliance with the Markets in

<<<

 Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) ("MiFID") to the extent it applies to it or, to the extent MiFID does not apply to it, in a manner which would be in compliance with MiFID if it were to apply to it; and
(iii) it will at all times

<<<

 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside the EEA) relating to the promotion, offering, distribution and/or sale of the Notes (or any beneficial interests therein), including (without limitation

<<<

) any such laws, regulations and regulatory guidance relating to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in the Notes by investors in any relevant jurisdiction.
Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed

<<<

 client when purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers the foregoing representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings will be given by and be binding upon both the

<<<

 agent and its underlying client.

RISK FACTORS
Prospective investors should read the entire Prospectus and reach

<<<

 their own views prior to making any investment decision.
The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. All of these factors are contingencies that may or may not occur and the

<<<

 Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring.
Factors which the Issuer believes may be material for the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are also described

<<<

 below.
The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes for other

<<<

 reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it and which it may not currently be able to anticipate.
The following is a general discussion o f certain risks typically associated

<<<

 with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o f the Notes. In particular, it does not consider an investor's specific knowledge and/or understanding about risks typically associated with the Issuer and the acquisition and ownership o

<<<

 f the Notes, whether obtained through experience, training or otherwise, or the lack o f such specific knowledge and/or understanding, or circumstances that may apply to a particular investor.
Words and expressions defined in the "Terms and

<<<

 Conditions o f the Notes " below or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same meanings in this section, unless otherwise stated. References to a numbered "Condition" shall be to the relevant Condition in the Terms and Conditions o f the Notes

<<<

.
Risks relating to the Issuer and the Jyske Bank Group
The Issuer is regulated by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (the "Danish FSA"), which ensures a regulatory environment comparable to the regulatory environments of other Western

<<<

 European banks.
In the course of its business activities, the Issuer is exposed to a variety of risks. If the Issuer fails to manage this exposure, it may incur financial losses and its reputation may be damaged. The Issuer considers risk management

<<<

 one of its core competences and a critical prerequisite for prudent bank management. Risk management includes identifying and measuring risk as well as monitoring and reporting risks. The Supervisory Board of the Issuer defines total risk tolerance

<<<

 and lays down policies and guidelines for the measurement, monitoring and reporting of risk, and the different risks the Issuer is exposed to are managed at different organisational levels. The main categories of risk are set out below.
Credit

<<<

 risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss caused by borrowers or counterparties failing to fulfil their obligations to the Jyske Bank Group and the risk of such parties' credit quality deteriorating. Credit risk is also the risk that the Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group may be unable to assess the credit risk of potential borrowers and may provide loans and advances or mortgage loans to customers that increase the Jyske Bank Group's credit risk exposure more than intended. Credit risk is an inherent

<<<

 part of the Jyske Bank Group's business. Ordinary credit risk arises from the Issuer's loan portfolio, mortgage lending in BRFkredit A/S's ("BRFkredit") capital centres and from credit lines and guarantees. However, credit risk also arises

<<<

 from credit investments in Jyske Bank Group Treasury in, for example, senior bonds of other highly rated financial institutions, securitisations consisting primarily of AAA residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") or AAA or AA rated

<<<

 collateralised loan/debt obligations ("CLOs/CDO") and from trading and hedging activities in Jyske Markets, which is the trading unit of the Jyske Bank Group. Market-related counterparty credit risk arises from financial instruments including

<<<

 fixed income, equity and other investments that the Jyske Bank Group owns or is in another way exposed to. Settlement and payment risk arises from securities transactions, derivatives transactions and other transactions where payment is remitted

<<<

 before it can be confirmed that any corresponding payment has been made to the Jyske Bank Group.
13

Failure by the Jyske Bank Group to manage these risks could have an adverse effect on the Jyske Bank Group's business, results of operations

<<<

, financial position or prospects.
Market risk
The Jyske Bank Group faces market risks as an inherent part of its business. Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse developments in market values resulting from fluctuations in interest

<<<

 rates, pricing of credit, foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. The performance of financial markets may cause changes in the value of the Jyske Bank Group's investment and trading portfolios as well as affect other

<<<

 areas of the operations such as the availability of funding. A significant part of the Jyske Bank Group's market risk derives from changes in the value of its securities portfolio.
Any fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange

<<<

 rates, equity prices and fixed income prices could have an adverse effect on the Jyske Bank Group's business, results of operations, financial position or prospects.
Funding and liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of losses arising because

<<<

 funding costs become excessive, a lack of funding prevents the Jyske Bank Group from fulfilling its business model or a lack of funding prevents the Jyske Bank Group from fulfilling its payment obligations. Being a financial intermediary, liquidity

<<<

 risk is an inherent and unavoidable part of the Jyske Bank Group's banking operations. Liquidity risk arises from funding mismatches in the balance sheet as the average duration of a bank's loan portfolio is generally longer than the average

<<<

 duration of a bank's funding sources. Furthermore, most retail banks receive a high portion of their funding from customer deposits, and therefore they are also subject to the risk that depositors could withdraw their funds at a faster rate

<<<

 than the rate at which borrowers repay their loans, thus causing liquidity strains. Ready access to funds is essential to any banking business, including the Jyske Bank Group. If the Jyske Bank Group is unable to access funds or to access the

<<<

 markets from which the Jyske Bank Group raises funds, it could have an adverse effect on the Jyske Bank Group's ability to meet its obligations as they fall due and impede the Jyske Bank Group's ability to finance its operations adequately

<<<

. These and other factors could also lead creditors to form a negative view of the Jyske Bank Group's liquidity, which could result in higher borrowing costs and decreased access to various funding sources which could have an adverse effect

<<<

 on the Jyske Bank Group's business, results of operations, financial position or prospects.
Pursuant to the "balance principle" set out in the Danish Executive Order no. 1425 of 16 December 2014 on the Issuance of Bonds, Balance Principle and

<<<

 Risk Management, BRFkredit is subject to limits on its exposure to liquidity risk. BRFkredit's mortgage borrowers are required to make their mortgage payments no later than the day before the date on which coupon payments on the mortgage bonds

<<<

 are due. Liquidity risk relating to mortgage bonds is therefore only incurred on late payments. In case of any non-payment by borrowers lasting for longer periods of time, BRFkredit may not be able to pay holders of mortgage bonds in full,

<<<

 and as a consequence this could have an adverse effect on the Jyske Bank Group's business, results of operations, financial position or prospects.
Risks relating to the credit ratings of Jyske Bank
The Issuer's credit ratings have an impact

<<<

 on the Issuer's funding costs, its ability to access international capital markets, and on the number of counterparties willing to enter into transactions with the Issuer. As at the date of this Prospectus, the Issuer has a rating agreement

<<<

 with S&P, and any senior debt or subordinated notes (such as the Notes) issued by the Issuer will only be rated (on a solicited basis) by S&P. As at 30 June 2016, the Issuer's S&P ratings were a Stand Alone Credit Profile ("SACP") of A-, a

<<<

 long-term rating of A-, and a short-term rating of A-2. The outlook of the ratings is stable.
S&P bases the ratings and the stable outlook on the Jyske Bank Group's "adequate" business position as Denmark's fourth largest banking group, and

<<<

 the assessment of the Jyske Bank Group's capital and earnings position as "strong" is based on S&P's belief that the bank will achieve a RAC ratio of 10.5 per cent. - 11 per cent. by year-end 2016 and keep it sustainable above 10 per cent.

<<<

 in the future.
14

S&P assesses the Jyske Bank Group's risk position as "adequate", reflecting improved diversification following the merger with BRFkredit, in combination with declining risks of further provisions as the Danish economy improves

<<<

. It views the Jyske Bank Group's funding as "average" and liquidity as "adequate", reflecting continued measures to improve the maturity profile of BRFkredit's covered bond funding.
S&P could consider a downgrade if the Jyske Bank Group is

<<<

 unable to maintain progress in terms of asset quality metrics. In particular, a reversal of the recent improvements in loan impairments could lead to a reassessment of the Jyske Bank Group's risk position or a change in S&P's capital projections

<<<

 of the RAC to a level below the anticipated stable level solidly above 10 per cent. S&P will also continue to monitor the improvements in the refinancing risk for Denmark's mortgage institutions, including Jyske Bank's subsidiary, BRFkredit

<<<

, and could lower the Jyske Bank Group's rating if the trend of improvement in the funding and liquidity profile (S&P's Stable Funding Ratio ("SFR")) were to reverse. The Jyske Bank Group SFR is below 100 per cent. as at the end of 2015 due

<<<

 to BRFkredit's funding structure and the relatively large proportion of 1-year adjustable rate mortgage loans.
The Issuer decided to terminate its rating agreement with Moody's rating agency in 2013. However, due to the Issuer's systemic importance

<<<

 in Denmark, Moody's continues to rate the Issuer on an unsolicited basis based only on publicly available information. Moody's sector reports on the Danish financial sector in general and specific reports on the Danish banking sector will therefore

<<<

 include an unsolicited rating of the Issuer.
Any reduction in the credit rating of the Issuer by S&P or potentially even a change in the unsolicited shadow rating by Moody's, could cause a deterioration in the market's perception of the Issuer

<<<

's financial resilience, which could significantly increase its borrowing costs and/or limit the Issuer's access to the capital markets. This could materially adversely affect the Issuer's access to liquidity, especially in the short term money

<<<

 market (such as the market for issuance of commercial paper). As a result, this could adversely affecting the Issuer's competitive position, increase its funding costs and, hence, have an adverse effect on the Issuer's business, results of

<<<

 operations, financial position or prospects.
Risks relating to the Jyske Bank Group's participation in the Deposit Guarantee Scheme
In Denmark and other jurisdictions, deposit guarantee schemes and similar funds (each, a "Deposit Guarantee

<<<

 Scheme") have been implemented from which compensation for deposits may become payable to customers of financial services firms in the event that such financial services firm is unable to pay, or unlikely to pay, claims against it. In many

<<<

 jurisdictions, these Deposit Guarantee Schemes are funded, directly or indirectly, by financial services firms which operate and/or are licensed in the relevant jurisdiction. Revised legislation regarding the Danish Deposit Guarantee Scheme

<<<

 redefines the Danish scheme as a premium based scheme funded by the banking sector itself, such that the participating banks' payments into the scheme will be more stable every year in profit and loss terms. The calculation of premium will

<<<

 be based on each participating bank's covered deposits and the relevant bank's risk profile. The premium payments will stop when a target level of 0.8 per cent. of covered deposits has been reached. According to the annual report 2015 of Finansiel

<<<

 Stabilitet, which administrates the Danish Deposit Guarantee Scheme, no further premium payments are expected in 2016. The resolution fund's capital must amount to 1 per cent. of the covered deposits of all Danish credit institutions to be

<<<

 reached by 31 December 2024. The future target level of funds to be accumulated in Deposit Guarantee Schemes and resolution funds across different EU countries may exceed the minimum levels provided for in the BRRD, Directive 2014/49/EU (the

<<<

 "Revised Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive") and in EU Regulation No 806/2014 and EU Regulation No 81/2015 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions

<<<

 and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund (the latter of which will be relevant should Denmark choose to participate in the Single Resolution Mechanism). Both the BRRD and the

<<<

 Revised Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive are implemented in Danish law as referred to in "Resolution tools and powers under the BRRD" below and by Consolidated Act no. 917 of 8 July 2015 on Depositor and Investor Guarantee Scheme as amended

<<<

 from time to time.
It is still unclear whether Denmark, despite being outside the Eurozone, will join the European Banking Union and therefore be part of the Single Resolution Mechanism. It therefore remains unclear which costs the Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group will incur in the coming year in relation to payments to deposit guarantee funds and/or resolution funds on a national or European level.
15

Risks relating to operational, business and reputational risks
The nature of the Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group's business entails operational risks, including the risk of fraud by management, employees or third parties, clerical or record keeping errors, errors resulting from failures in information technology ("IT") or telecommunications systems

<<<

, failure to obtain proper internal authorisation, failure to comply with regulatory requirements and codes of conduct or adverse effects of external events that may affect the operations and reputation of the Jyske Bank Group. Although the

<<<

 Jyske Bank Group has implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures and training staff, it is not possible to implement procedures which are fully effective in

<<<

 controlling each of the operational risks. Business risk is the risk of losses caused by changes in external circumstances or events that harm the Jyske Bank Group's image or operational performance. Business risk includes strategic risk and

<<<

 reputational risk.
Failure by the Jyske Bank Group to identify and manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Jyske Bank Group's business, results of operations, financial position or prospects.
Risks relating to pending

<<<

 orpotential litigation and other regulatory risks
The Jyske Bank Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to potentially significant litigation and regulatory risks. As a result, the Jyske Bank Group is and may become

<<<

 involved in various disputes and legal proceedings in Denmark and other jurisdictions, including litigation and regulatory investigations. Such disputes and legal proceedings are subject to many uncertainties, and their outcomes are often difficult

<<<

 to predict, particularly in the earlier stages of a case or investigation.
As at the date of the Prospectus there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which

<<<

 the Issuer is aware of) which may have significant effects on the Issuer and/or the Jyske Bank Group's financial position or results of operations.
Risks related to the general economic and geopolitical conditions in Denmark
The Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group's performance is significantly influenced by the general economic conditions in the countries in which it operates, in particular in Denmark where the Issuer focuses its operations. The Danish economy is a small open economy that is closely

<<<

 linked to the global economy and especially the macroeconomic conditions in Europe. Since mid-2013, the Danish economy has been in a slow upturn with modest GDP-growth, increasing employment and rising house prices. Exports have been negatively

<<<

 affected throughout 2015 by weaker global trends, but low interest rates and real wage growth are likely to continue to support domestic demand going forward. The slow upturn is likely to continue in the following years and may even pick up

<<<

 a little. However, there is a risk that the upturn in the Danish economy will come to a halt if the global economy slows further as a result of setbacks in China or the US. This could intensify consolidation in Europe (including Denmark) and

<<<

 also increase the risk of a real deflationary trend.
The operations, financial condition and prospects of the Jyske Bank Group could be materially adversely impacted by a weaker or longer than expected recovery in the Danish economy driven

<<<

 by either lack of improvement in domestic demand or a weaker, or longer than anticipated, recovery in the global economy, especially the Euro zone countries. Any such adverse development could lead to lower than expected revenues, caused by

<<<

 further declines in net interest margins, widening of credit spreads, continued negative loan portfolio growth, persistent high or even increasing loan impairment charges for the Jyske Bank Group due to deteriorating credit quality, as well

<<<

 as further corrections in prices of real estate and other property held as collateral for loans, which may also lead to additional loan impairment charges, putting pressure on the Jyske Bank Group's business, results of operations, financial

<<<

 position or prospects.
General regulatory risk
The Issuer is subject to financial services laws, regulations, administrative actions and policies in Denmark and in each other jurisdiction in which the Issuer carries on business. Regulatory

<<<

 risk is the risk that changes in supervision and regulation, in particular in Denmark, could materially affect the Issuer's business, the products and services offered or the value of its assets. Although the Issuer works closely with its regulators

<<<

 and
16

continually monitors the situation, future changes in regulation, fiscal or other policies can be unpredictable and are beyond the control of the Issuer.
Regulatory risk may also arise from a failure by the Jyske Bank Group to comply

<<<

 with laws and regulations, which could lead to civil liability, disciplinary action, the imposition of fines and/or the revocation of the licence, permission or authorisation to conduct the Jyske Bank Group's business in the jurisdictions in

<<<

 which the Jyske Bank Group operates.
Various aspects of banking regulations are still under debate internationally, including, inter alia, proposals to review standardised approaches for capital requirements for credit, market and operational

<<<

 risk (together with a proposed capital floor based on the revised approaches for banks using internal models) as well as proposals to increase a financial institution's ability to absorb losses in a situation where it is deemed no longer viable

<<<

.
Regulatory capital risks
The CRD IV Directive and the CRR have both come into force in Denmark in 2014, the CRD IV Directive through implementation in the Danish Financial Business Act whereas the CRR applies directly without implementation

<<<

 in national law (see "Legislative and Regulatory Review" below).
The CRD IV/CRR framework implements among other things the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (the "Basel Committee") proposals imposing stricter capital and liquidity requirements

<<<

 upon banks ("Basel III") in the EU. Each of the CRR and the CRD IV Directive covers a wide range of prudent requirements for banks across EU member states, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, risk exposure

<<<

 amounts ("REA"), leverage ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding requirements. The CRD IV Directive covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual risk assessment) and other measures such as

<<<

 the combined capital buffer requirements, systematically important financial institution ("SIFI") definition, governance and remuneration requirements.
The European Banking Authority ("EBA") will continue to propose detailed rules through binding

<<<

 technical standards, guidelines, recommendations and/or opinions in respect of many areas, including liquidity requirements and certain aspects of capital requirements. Thus some uncertainty still exists in relation to the EBA's technical standards

<<<

 for the implementation of the new rules that are to be finalised by the end of 2016. As a consequence, the Group is subject to the risk of possible interpretational changes. Given the uncertainty of the exact wording of the technical standards

<<<

, they could potentially lead to a reduction in the regulatory capital or an increase in the REA of the Jyske Bank Group. Furthermore, the CRD IV Directive contains rules which enable the competent authorities to increase capital requirements

<<<

 to previously unforeseen levels which potentially could limit the Jyske Bank Group's ability to fulfil its present strategy, leading to lower than expected earnings and/or higher than expected REA.
There can be no assurance that the European

<<<

 Commission and/or the Danish FSA will not implement other reforms in a manner that is different from that which is currently envisaged, or that they may impose additional capital and liquidity requirements on Danish banks.
If the regulatory

<<<

 capital requirements, liquidity restrictions or ratios applied to the Jyske Bank Group are increased in the future, any failure of the Jyske Bank Group to maintain such increased capital and liquidity ratios could result in administrative actions

<<<

 or sanctions, which may have an adverse effect on the Jyske Bank Group's results of operations.
Risks related to the structure of the Notes
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are subordinated
Subject to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following

<<<

 a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), the Notes will constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer as described in Condition 4 (Status of the Notes).
17

The Issuer may issue other obligations

<<<

 or capital instruments that rank or are expressed to rank senior to the Notes or pari passu to the Notes, in each case as regards the right to receive periodic payments (to the extent any such periodic payment has not been cancelled) on a liquidation

<<<

 or bankruptcy of the Issuer and the right to receive repayment of capital on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Issuer will be required to pay (i) its depositors, (ii) its

<<<

 other unsubordinated creditors and (iii) its other subordinated creditors other than the present or future claims of creditors that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes in full before it can make any payments

<<<

 on the Notes. If this occurs, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining after these payments are made to pay amounts due under the Notes. In addition, in the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, to the extent the Issuer

<<<

 has assets remaining after paying its creditors who rank senior to the Notes, payments relating to other obligations or capital instruments of the Issuer that rank or are expressed to rank pari passu with the Notes may, if there are insufficient

<<<

 assets to satisfy the claims of all of the Issuer's pari passu creditors, further reduce the assets available to pay amounts due under the Notes on a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
Loss absorptionfollowing a Trigger Event
The Notes

<<<

 are being issued for regulatory capital adequacy purposes with the intention and purpose of being eligible as Additional Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer and the Group. Such eligibility depends upon a number of conditions being satisfied, which

<<<

 are reflected in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and which, in particular, require the Notes and the proceeds of their issue to be available to absorb any losses of the Issuer and/or the Group.
Accordingly, if at any time the Common Equity

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and the Group has fallen below 7.00 per cent., the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall be reduced as described below and in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes

<<<

).
Noteholders may lose all or some of their investment as a result of such a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts. In the case of any such reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts, in compliance with the CRD IV and BRRD requirements

<<<

 and subject to the Loss Absorption Minimum Amount, the amount of the relevant reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts on the Write Down Date will be equal to the amount of a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts on the Write

<<<

 Down Date that would restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, to at least the Trigger Event Threshold at the point of such reduction, taking into account the amount of Common Equity Tier

<<<

 1 Capital (if any) of the Issuer and/or the Group, as the case may be, generated on or prior to the Write Down Date by the pro rata reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal

<<<

 amount of all Other Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) outstanding at such time.
It is possible that, following a material decrease in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, a Trigger Event could occur simultaneously

<<<

 with a trigger event in relation to one or more Other Loss Absorbing Instruments having a higher or, as the case may be, lower trigger level than the Trigger Event Threshold in respect of the Notes. In such circumstances, investors should note

<<<

 that, with respect to each such Other Loss Absorbing Instrument (if any), Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) provides that the pro rata reduction or, as the case may be, conversion shall only be taken into account as

<<<

 described above to the extent required to restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, to the Trigger Event Threshold or, if lower, such Other Loss Absorbing Instrument's trigger level. Once

<<<

 the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable, has been restored to at least the Trigger Event Threshold at the point of the relevant reduction, the Issuer expects that any additional amounts of Common

<<<

 Equity Tier 1 Capital which are required to cure a trigger event in relation to any Other Loss Absorbing Instruments with a higher trigger level ("Higher Trigger Other Loss Absorbing Instruments") than the Trigger Event Threshold will only

<<<

 be generated by the further reduction to, or, as the case may be, further conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of such Higher Trigger Other Loss Absorbing Instruments, in each case in accordance

<<<

 with the terms of such Higher Trigger Other Loss Absorbing Instruments and the CRD IV requirements.
Investors should also note that, if the Issuer issues any Full Loss Absorbing Instruments, the Issuer expects that such Full Loss Absorbing

<<<

 Instruments shall be treated for the purposes of determining the relevant pro rata amounts to be taken into account as described above and in Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger
18

Event) as if their terms permitted partial

<<<

 reduction or, as the case may be, partial conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments.
In addition, investors should note that in Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) provides that, to the extent the reduction

<<<

 to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing Instrument is not, or by the Write Down Date will not be, effective for any reason:
(A) the ineffectiveness

<<<

 of any such reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments shall not prejudice the requirement to effect a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption

<<<

 Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes); and
(B) the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing Instrument which is not

<<<

, or by the Write Down Date will not be, effective shall not be taken into account in determining the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event).
Therefore (i) the reduction

<<<

 to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing Instruments is not a condition to a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts and (ii) as a result

<<<

 of any failure to reduce or, as the case may be, convert into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments the principal amount of any Other Loss Absorbing Instruments, the amount of the reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts may therefore

<<<

 be higher than expected and, furthermore, may be higher than the amount of the reduction of the principal amount of any other Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments.
As any such reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts is subject to

<<<

 compliance with the CRD IV and BRRD requirements, the reduction provisions described above and in Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) are subject to, and will be interpreted in light of, any applicable changes to any such

<<<

 requirements. Notwithstanding any of the provisions relating to a reduction of the Notes as described above, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will not determine that the CRD IV requirements require a reduction to the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts to be calculated and determined in a different manner than as described above and in Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event). Investors should note that, in the case of any such reduction to the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts pursuant to Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event), the Issuer's determination of the relevant amount of such reduction shall be binding on all parties.
Any such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts shall

<<<

 not constitute an event of default under the terms of the Notes and, following such reduction, Noteholders' claims in respect of principal will, in all cases, be based on the reduced Outstanding Principal Amounts to the extent the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amounts have not subsequently been reinstated as described in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes).
In addition, following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described

<<<

 above, interest can only continue to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amounts following such reduction, which will be lower than the Original Principal Amount of the Notes.
Following any such reduction, the Issuer will not in any circumstances

<<<

 be obliged to reinstate the Outstanding Principal Amounts, but any reinstatement must be undertaken, subject to compliance with CRD IV requirements and the Reinstatement Limit described in Condition 7.2 (Reinstatement of the Notes), on a pro

<<<

 rata basis with all other Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) which would, following such reinstatement, constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital and feature similar reinstatement provisions. Investors should note that, while the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions of the Notes provide for a pro rata reinstatement as described in the preceding sentence, there is no guarantee (including as regards the timing of the relevant reinstatement) how a reinstatement of the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts would be conducted when compared to any proposed reinstatement of any obligations or capital instruments of the Issuer (i) with a similar principal loss absorption mechanism but with a
19

higher or lower trigger level compared to

<<<

 the Trigger Event Threshold and (ii) which include similar reinstatement provisions.
Investors should note that, while such a reduction is not common, it is an appreciable risk and is not limited to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer

<<<

.
Resolution tools andpowers under the BRRD
On 15 May 2014, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted a directive providing for the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions

<<<

 and investment firms (Directive 2014/59/EU) (the "BRRD"). The BRRD, including the general bail-in tool and MREL (as defined below) has been implemented into Danish law with effect as of 1 June 2015 by Consolidated Act No. 333 of 31 March 2

<<<

015 on Restructuring and Resolution of Certain Financial Undertakings as amended from time to time (the "Danish Resolution Act") and by amendments to the Danish Financial Business Act.
The BRRD is designed to provide authorities designated by

<<<

 Member States with a credible set of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in an unsound or failing credit institutions or investment firms (each, an "institution") to ensure the continuity of the institution's critical financial

<<<

 and economic functions while minimising the impact of an institution's failure on the economy and financial system.
The BRRD contains four resolution powers which may be used alone or in combination where the relevant resolution authority considers

<<<

 that (a) an institution is failing or likely to fail, (b) there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures would prevent the failure of such institution within a reasonable timeframe, and (c) a resolution action

<<<

 is in the public interest, the relevant resolution authority may use the following resolution tools and powers alone or in combination without the consent of the institution's creditors: (i) sale of business - which enables resolution authorities

<<<

 to direct the sale of the institution or the whole or part of its business on commercial terms; (ii) bridge institution - which enables resolution authorities to transfer all or part of the business of the institution to a "bridge institution

<<<

" (an entity created for this purpose that is wholly or partially in public control), which may limit the capacity of the institution to meet its repayment obligations; (iii) asset separation - which enables resolution authorities to transfer

<<<

 impaired or problem assets to one or more publicly owned asset management vehicles to allow them to be managed with a view to maximising their value through eventual sale or orderly wind-down (this can be used together with another resolution

<<<

 tool only); and (iv) bail-in relating to eligible liabilities - which gives resolution authorities the power to write down certain claims of unsecured creditors of a failing institution (which write-down may result in the reduction of such

<<<

 claims to zero) and to convert certain unsecured debt claims (including the Notes) to equity or other instruments of ownership (the "general bail-in tool"), which equity or other instruments could also be subject to any future application of

<<<

 the general bail-in tool.
The BRRD also provides for a Member State as a last resort, after having assessed and exploited the above resolution tools to the maximum extent possible whilst maintaining financial stability, to be able to provide

<<<

 extraordinary public financial support through additional financial stabilisation tools. These consist of public equity support and temporary public ownership tools. Any such extraordinary financial support must be provided in accordance with

<<<

 the EU state aid framework.
An institution will be considered as failing or likely to fail when either: (i) it is, or is likely in the near future to be, in breach of its requirements for continuing authorisation; its assets are, or are likely

<<<

 in the near future to be, less than its liabilities; (ii) it is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) it requires extraordinary public financial support (except in limited circumstances)

<<<

.
In addition to the general bail-in tool, the BRRD provides for resolution authorities to have the further power to permanently write-down or convert into equity, capital instruments (such as the Notes), at the point of non viability and before

<<<

 any other resolution action is taken ("non-viability loss absorption"). Any shares issued to Noteholders upon any such conversion into equity may also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool.
Any application of the general

<<<

 bail-in tool and, in the case of the Notes, non-viability loss absorption under the BRRD shall be in accordance with the hierarchy of claims in normal insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, the
20

impact of such application on Noteholders will

<<<

 depend on their ranking in accordance with such hierarchy, including any priority given to other creditors such as depositors.
To the extent any resulting treatment of Noteholders pursuant to the exercise of the general bail-in tool is less

<<<

 favourable than would have been the case under such hierarchy in normal insolvency proceedings, a Noteholder has a right to compensation under the BRRD based on an independent valuation of the firm (which is referred to as the "no creditor

<<<

 worse o ff' principle under the BRRD). Any such compensation is unlikely to compensate that holder for the losses it has actually incurred and there is likely to be a considerable delay in the recovery of such compensation. Compensation payments

<<<

 (if any) are also likely to be made considerably later than when amounts may otherwise have been due under the Notes.
For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point of non-viability under the BRRD

<<<

 is the point at which the relevant authority determines that the institution or group meets the applicable conditions for resolution (but no resolution action has yet been taken) or that the institution or group will no longer be viable unless

<<<

 the relevant capital instruments (such as the Notes) are written-down or converted or extraordinary public support is to be provided and without such support the appropriate authority determines that the institution or group would no longer

<<<

 be viable. A group shall be deemed to be failing or likely to fail where the group infringes or there are objective elements to support a determination that the group, in the near future, will infringe its consolidated solvency requirements

<<<

 in a way that would justify action by the relevant authority including, but not limited to, where the group has incurred or is likely to incur losses that will deplete all or a significant amount of its own funds (as defined in the CRR).
The

<<<

 BRRD (and thereby also the Danish Resolution Act) also provides resolution authorities with broader powers to implement other resolution measures with respect to distressed banks, which may include (without limitation) the replacement or substitution

<<<

 o f the bank as obligor in respect o f debt instruments, modifications to the terms of debt instruments (including altering the amount of interest payable and/or imposing a temporary suspension on payments) and discontinuing the listing and

<<<

 admission to trading o f financial instruments.
With the implementation of the BRRD, European banks are required to have bail in-able resources in order to fulfil the Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities ("MREL"). There

<<<

 is no minimum EU wide level of MREL - each resolution authority is required to make a separate determination of the appropriate MREL requirement for each resolution group within its jurisdiction, depending on the resolvability, risk profile

<<<

, systemic importance and other characteristics o f each institution. The requirement for Danish institutions is expected to be based on the EBA methodology. The authorities are expected to determine the exact MREL requirement for the largest

<<<

 Danish banks during 2016 in conjunction with the preparation of their resolution plans. This may require Danish SIFIs and other banks to issue debt that can be bailed in. If an institution does not fulfil the MREL requirement, the relevant

<<<

 authority may withdraw its banking licence. Also, a comparable concept for loss absorption, Total Loss Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC"), is under discussion internationally, and these discussions and their outcome could influence the implementation

<<<

 o f MREL.
The powers set out in the BRRD will impact how credit institutions and investment firms are managed, as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights o f creditors.
The Noteholders may be subject to the application of the general

<<<

 bail-in tool and/or non-viability loss absorption and/or statutory resolution powers, which may result in such Noteholders losing some or all of their investment. As a result, the exercise o f any power under the Danish Resolution Act or any

<<<

 suggestion o f such exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the rights o f Noteholders, the price or value o f their investment in the Notes and/or the ability o f the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.
Depositor

<<<

 preference
As part o f the reforms required by the BRRD, amendments have been made to relevant legislation in Denmark to establish a preference in the insolvency hierarchy for certain deposits that are eligible for protection by the Danish

<<<

 Deposit Guarantee Scheme and the uninsured element of such deposits and, in certain circumstances, deposits made in non-EEA branches. In addition, the Danish implementation of the Revised Deposit Guarantee Scheme increased the nature and quantum

<<<

 o f insured deposits to cover a wide range o f deposits, including certain corporate deposits (unless the depositor is a public sector body or financial institution) and some temporary high
21

value deposits. The effect of these changes is

<<<

 to increase the size of the class of preferred creditors. All such preferred deposits will rank in the insolvency hierarchy ahead of all other unsecured creditors of the Issuer, including the Noteholders. Furthermore, insured deposits are excluded

<<<

 from the scope of the general bail-in tool. As a result, if the general bail-in tool were exercised by the relevant resolution authority, the Notes would be more likely to be bailed-in than certain other unsubordinated liabilities of the Issuer

<<<

 such as other preferred deposits.

No scheduled redemption

The Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for redemption. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Notes at any time (except as provided in Condition 8 (Redemption

<<<

 and Purchase) and, in any such case, subject always to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.)). There will be no redemption at the option of the Noteholders in any circumstances. Therefore, prospective investors in the Notes should be

<<<

 aware that they will be required to bear the financial risks associated with an investment in long term securities.

Cancellation o f Interest

Subject as provided in Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), any payment of interest in respect of

<<<

 the Notes shall be payable only out of the Issuer's Distributable Items and:

(i)

may be cancelled, at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer in its sole discretion;

or

(ii)

will be mandatorily cancelled, in whole or

<<<

 in part, to the extent:

(A) that, if the relevant payment were so made, the amount of such payment, when aggregated together with other distributions of the kind referred to in Article 141(2) of the CRD IV Directive (or, as the case may be

<<<

, any provision of Danish law transposing or implementing Article 141 (2) of the CRD IV Directive), or any successor thereto, would cause a breach of any regulatory restriction or prohibition on payments on Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments

<<<

 relating to any applicable Maximum Distributable Amount; or

(B) otherwise so required by CRD IV, including the applicable criteria for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, or where the Relevant Regulator requires the Issuer to cancel the

<<<

 relevant payment in whole or in part.

The CRD IV requirements currently provide that discretionary payments in respect of certain capital instruments (including payments of interest on the Notes, which would include, for the avoidance of doubt

<<<

, any Additional Amounts in respect of interest which may be payable under Condition 10 (Taxation)) will be required to be cancelled, in whole or in part, to the extent that:

(i)

the Issuer's Distributable Items are insufficient to make the

<<<

 relevant payment(s); or

(ii)

the combined buffer requirement is not met and, if the relevant payment(s) were made, the

amount of such payment(s) would exceed the Maximum Distributable Amount.

The Issuer also expects to cancel any such discretionary

<<<

 payment to the extent that the CRD IV prescribes and/or, as the case may be, the Relevant Regulator requires that the relevant payment(s) shall be cancelled.

The Issuer's Distributable Items will depend to a large extent on the net income

<<<

 earned by the Issuer. The determination of the Maximum Distributable Amount is subject to some uncertainty. See further the risk factor entitled "Additional Capital Buffer Requirements'"below.

As discussed above, the Issuer is entitled to

<<<

 cancel payments of interest in its sole discretion and it is permitted to do so even if it could make such payments without exceeding the limits described in the paragraph immediately above. Notwithstanding the above expectations, payments

<<<

 of interest on the Notes may be cancelled even if (i) holders of the Issuer's shares continue to receive dividends and/or (ii) Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes (if any) remain outstanding and holders of those Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital

<<<

 Notes continue to receive interest
22

payments. It is the Issuer's current intention that, whenever exercising its discretion to propose any dividend in respect of the Issuer's shares, or the payment of interest to holders of outstanding

<<<

 Existing Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes (if any) or its discretion to cancel payments of interest on the Notes, the Issuer will take into account the relative ranking of these instruments in its capital structure. However, the Issuer may at any

<<<

 time depart from this policy at its sole discretion.
Following any cancellation of interest as described above, the right of Noteholders to receive accrued interest in respect of the relevant Interest Period will terminate and the Issuer will

<<<

 have no further obligation to pay such interest or to pay interest thereon, whether or not payments of interest in respect of subsequent Interest Periods are made, and such unpaid interest will not be deemed to have "accrued" or been earned

<<<

 for any purpose nor will the non-payment of such interest constitute an event of default under the Notes.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest payments will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition

<<<

, as a result of the interest cancellation provision of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may

<<<

 be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the financial condition of the Issuer and/or the Group. Noteholders should be aware that any announcement relating to the future cancellation of interest payments or any actual cancellation

<<<

 of interest payments may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. Noteholders may find it difficult to sell their Notes in such circumstances, or may only be able to sell their Notes at a price which may be significantly lower

<<<

 than the price at which they purchased their Notes. In such event, Noteholders may lose some or substantially all of their investment in the Notes.
Notes subject to optional redemption by the Issuer or upon the occurrence o f a Special Event

<<<


Subject as provided herein, in particular to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes on the First Call Date or on any Interest Payment Date thereafter at their

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled. Subject as aforesaid, upon the occurrence of a Special Event, the Issuer may also, at its option on any Interest Payment Date redeem

<<<

 all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes at their Outstanding Principal Amounts, together with accrued interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled.
Noteholders should note that the Issuer may redeem the Notes as described

<<<

 in the previous paragraph even if (i) the Outstanding Principal Amounts have been so reduced and (ii) the principal amount of the Notes has not been fully reinstated to the original principal amount of the Notes.
An optional redemption feature

<<<

 is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also

<<<

 may be true prior to any redemption period.
The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption

<<<

 proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments

<<<

 available at that time.
Substitution and variation o f the Notes without Noteholder consent
Subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), if a Special Event has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer may, at its option, and without

<<<

 the consent or approval of the Noteholders, elect either (i) to substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes or (ii) to vary the terms of all (but not some only) of the Notes, so that they become or remain Qualifying Capital Notes.
Qualifying

<<<

 Capital Notes are securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer that have, inter alia, terms not materially less favorable to the Noteholders (as a class) than the terms of the Notes (provided that the Issuer shall have delivered a certificate

<<<

 to that effect signed by two of its Directors to the Principal Paying Agent). See Condition 8.6 (Substitution and variation). There can be no assurance that, due to the particular circumstances of each Noteholder, any Qualifying Capital Notes

<<<

 will be as favourable to each Noteholder in all respects or that, if it were entitled to do so, a particular Noteholder would make the same determination as the Issuer as to whether the
23

terms of the relevant Qualifying Capital Notes are

<<<

 not materially less favourable to Noteholders than the terms of the Notes. The Issuer bears no responsibility towards the Noteholders for any adverse effects of such substitution or variation (including, without limitation, with respect to

<<<

 any adverse tax consequences suffered by any Noteholder).
No events o f default and limited enforcement rights available to Noteholders
The terms of the Notes do not provide for any events of default. Noteholders may not at any time demand

<<<

 repayment or redemption of their Notes, and enforcement rights for any payment are limited to the claim of Noteholders in a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer. In a liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer, a Noteholder may prove or claim

<<<

 in such proceedings in respect of such Note, such claim being for payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount of such Note at the time of commencement of such liquidation or bankruptcy together with any interest accrued and unpaid on such Note

<<<

 (to the extent that the same is not cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Notes) from (and including) the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding commencement of such liquidation or bankruptcy and any other amounts payable on such

<<<

 Note under the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.
According to Section 17(2) of Consolidated Act No. 11 of 6 January 2014, as amended or replaced from time to time (the "Danish Bankruptcy Act") (in Danish: konkursloven), a debtor is insolvent

<<<

, if it cannot meet its obligations as and when they fall due, unless the inability to meet such obligations may be considered to be temporary. However, according to Section 234(2) of the Danish Financial Business Act, notwithstanding Section

<<<

 17(2) of the Danish Bankruptcy Act, if the Issuer cannot meet its obligations regarding capital raised as Additional Tier 1 Capital, which as of the date hereof will include the Notes, the Issuer is not considered insolvent. Therefore, even

<<<

 if the Issuer cannot meet its obligations regarding capital raised as Additional Tier 1 Capital, the Issuer will not be considered insolvent. Accordingly, a Noteholder may not itself file for the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer.
If

<<<

 proceedings with respect to the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer should occur, the Noteholders would be required to pursue their claims on the Notes in proceedings with respect to the Issuer in Denmark. In addition, to the extent that

<<<

 the holders are entitled to any recovery with respect to the Notes in any such Danish bankruptcy proceedings, such holders would be entitled to a recovery in Danish Kroner or, as the case may be, other currencies, which would be based on the

<<<

 relevant conversion rate in effect on the date the Issuer entered into such liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings.
The market price and liquidity o f the Notes may be volatile and will be affected by a number offactors, many of which may be

<<<

 outside the Issuer's control
The market price and liquidity of the Notes is expected to be affected by fluctuations in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group. Any indication that the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital

<<<

 Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group is trending towards 7.00 per cent. may have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes. The level of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group may significantly

<<<

 affect the trading price of the Notes.
The occurrence of a Trigger Event and, therefore a write-down of the Original Principal Amounts, is inherently unpredictable and depends on a number of factors, many of which may be outside the Issuer

<<<

's control. Because the Relevant Regulator may require the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios to be calculated as of any date, a Trigger Event could occur at any time. The calculation of the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios of the Issuer

<<<

 and/or the Group could be affected by a wide range of factors, including, among other things, factors affecting the level of the Issuer's and/or the Group's earnings or dividend payments, the mix of businesses, the ability to effectively manage

<<<

 the risk exposure amounts in both the ongoing businesses and those the Issuer and/or the Group may seek to exit, losses in commercial banking, investment banking or other businesses, changes in the Group's structure or organisation, or any

<<<

 of the factors described in "Description of Jyske Bank A/S and the Jyske Bank Group" The calculation of the ratios also may be affected by changes in applicable accounting rules and the manner in which accounting policies are applied, including

<<<

 the manner in which permitted discretion is under the applicable accounting rules is exercised.
24

Due to the uncertainty regarding whether a Trigger Event will occur, it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, the Notes may be written

<<<

 down. Accordingly, the trading behaviour of the Notes may not necessarily follow the trading behaviour of other types of subordinated securities. Any indication that the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group is approaching

<<<

 the level that would trigger a Trigger Event or that the Maximum Distributable Amount may have been, or is likely to be, exceeded may have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Notes. Under such circumstances, investors

<<<

 may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to more conventional investments.
Uncertainties remain regarding the manner in which CRD IV will be interpreted
The defined terms in the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions of the Notes will depend in some cases on the final interpretation of CRD IV. CRD IV is a recently-adopted set of rules and regulations that imposes a series of new requirements, many of which will be phased in over a number

<<<

 of years. Certain portions of the CRD IV Directive required transposition into Danish law, and although the CRR will be directly applicable in each Member State, the CRR leaves a number of important interpretational issues to be resolved through

<<<

 binding technical standards that have been adopted, and will be adopted in the future, and leaves certain other matters to the discretion of the Relevant Regulator. The manner in which the framework and requirements under CRD IV will be applied

<<<

 to the Issuer and the Group remains uncertain to a degree.
The determination of the Maximum Distributable Amount is particularly complex. The Maximum Distributable Amount imposes a cap on the Issuer's ability to pay interest on the Notes, and

<<<

 on the Issuer's ability to reinstate the principal amounts of the Notes following a reduction upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event.
Additional capital buffer requirements
Under CRD IV, institutions are required to hold a minimum amount of

<<<

 regulatory capital equal to 8 per cent. of Risk Exposure Amounts (of which at least 4.5 per cent. must be Common Equity Tier 1 Capital). In addition to these so-called minimum own funds Pillar 1 requirements (the "minimum own funds requirements

<<<

"), CRD IV (including but not limited to, Article 128) also introduces capital buffer requirements that are in addition to the minimum "own funds" requirements and are required to be met with Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. It introduces five

<<<

 new capital buffers: (i) the capital conservation buffer, (ii) the institution-specific counter-cyclical buffer, (iii) the global systemically important institutions buffer, (iv) the other systemically important institutions buffer and (v)

<<<

 the systemic risk buffer. The Danish implementation of the capital buffer requirements does not include implementation of the other systemically important institutions buffer. At the time of issuance, no Danish credit institutions have been

<<<

 appointed as a global systemically important institution. Subject as aforesaid and to transitional provisions, these capital buffers, are, at the time of issuance, expected to apply to the Issuer on a solo basis and the Group on a consolidated

<<<

 basis.
Under Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive, EU Member States must require that institutions that fail to meet (the "combined buffer requirement") (broadly, the combination of the capital conservation buffer, the institutionspecific counter

<<<

-cyclical buffer and the higher of (depending on the institution), the systemic risk buffer, the global systemically important institutions buffer and, in general, the other systemically important institution buffer, in each case as applicable

<<<

 to the institution) will be subject to restricted "discretionary payments" (which are defined broadly by CRD IV as distributions in connection with Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, payments on Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments and, under certain

<<<

 conditions, payments of variable remuneration). The restrictions will be scaled according to the extent of the breach of the combined buffer requirement and calculated as a percentage of the profits of the institution since the most recent

<<<

 decision on the distribution of profits or discretionary payment. Such calculation will result in a "maximum distributable amount" in each relevant period. As an example, the scaling is such that in the bottom quartile of the combined buffer

<<<

 requirement, no discretionary distributions will be permitted to be paid. As a consequence, in the event of breach of the combined buffer requirement it may be necessary to reduce discretionary payments, including potentially exercising the

<<<

 discretion to cancel (in whole or in part) interest payments in respect of the Notes. Moreover in the event that the combined buffer requirement is no longer met by the credit institution it will be required to submit a capital conservation

<<<

 plan to the Relevant Regulator and if the capital conservation plan is not approved by the Relevant Regulator more stringent restrictions on distributions, than those required subject to Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive, can be imposed on

<<<

 the credit institution. Further, there can be no assurance that any of the combined buffer
25

requirements applicable to the Issuer and/or the Group will not be increased in the future, which may exacerbate the risk that discretionary payments

<<<

, including payments of interest on the Notes, are cancelled.
In addition to the minimum own funds requirements described above, CRD IV (including but not limited to Article 104(1)(a) of the CRD IV Directive) contemplates that competent authorities

<<<

 may require additional "Pillar 2" capital to be maintained by an institution relating to elements of risks which are not fully captured by the minimum own funds requirements (the "additional own funds requirements" or the "individual solvency

<<<

 requirement") or to address macro-prudential requirements.
The national implementation of Article 104(1)(a) of the CRD IV Directive in Denmark currently envisages that "Pillar 2" capital requirements imposed thereunder should not be considered

<<<

 to comprise part of an institution's minimum own funds requirements; however there can be no assurance that any future legislation would not result in an increase to the amount of capital required by an institution in order to comply with the

<<<

 applicable combined buffer requirement and the additional own funds requirement.
The EBA published guidelines on 19 December 2014 addressed to national supervisors on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation

<<<

 process ("SREP") which contained guidelines proposing a common approach to determining the amount and composition of additional own funds requirements and which was to be implemented by 1 January 2016. Under these guidelines, national supervisors

<<<

 should set a composition requirement for the additional own funds requirements to cover certain risks of at least 56 per cent. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and at least 75 per cent. Tier 1 capital. The guidelines also contemplate that national

<<<

 supervisors should not set additional own funds requirements in respect of risks which are already covered by capital buffer requirements and/or additional macro-prudential requirements; and, accordingly, the combined buffer requirement is

<<<

 in addition to the minimum own funds requirement and to the additional own funds requirement. The SREP was implemented in Denmark with effect as of 1 January 2016 by Executive Order no. 1587 of 3 December 2015 on Capital to Fulfil the Individual

<<<

 Solvency Requirement of Credit Institutions. According hereto credit institutions' additional own funds requirement shall be met with at least 56 per cent. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and at least 75 per cent. Tier 1 capital. The remaining

<<<

 25 per cent. of the additional own funds requirement may be fulfilled with Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Additional Tier 1 Capital or Tier 2 capital. Additional Tier 1 Capital or Tier 2 capital instruments issued prior to 31 December 2015 that

<<<

 until 31 December 2015 were eligible to cover credit institutions' additional own funds requirements will be grandfathered until 31 December 2021.
As set out in the "Opinion of the European Banking Authority on the interaction of Pillar 1,

<<<

 Pillar 2 and combined buffer requirements and restrictions on distributions" published on 16 December 2015 (the "December 2015 EBA Opinion"), in the EBA's opinion competent authorities should ensure that the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to

<<<

 be taken into account in determining the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital available to meet the "combined buffer requirement" for the purposes of the Maximum Distributable Amount calculation is limited to the amount not used to meet the "Pillar

<<<

 1" and "Pillar 2" own funds requirements of the institution. In addition, the December 2015 EBA Opinion advises the European Commission (i) to review Article 141 of the CRD IV Directive with a view to avoiding differing interpretations of Article

<<<

 141(6) and ensure greater consistency between the maximum distributable amount framework and the capital stacking order described in the opinion and in the EBA's SREP guidelines and (ii) to review the prohibition on distributions in all circumstances

<<<

 where an institution fails to meet the "combined buffer requirement" and no profits are made in any given year, notably insofar as it relates to Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments.
In line with the approach recommended in the December 2

<<<

015 EBA Opinion, the European Central Bank published a presentation on its SREP methodology on 19 February 2016 (the "SREP Booklet") in which it outlined that only Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in excess of that used to meet an institution's

<<<

 "Pillar 1" and "Pillar 2" Common Equity Tier 1 Capital requirements will be taken into account for determining the "maximum distributable amount". Further, in March 2016, it was widely reported that, in the context of its wider review of the

<<<

 CRR and CRD IV, an expert group of the European Commission was considering, among other things, clarifications to the operation of automatic restrictions on earnings distributions such that if an institution meets the sum of its "Pillar 1"

<<<

 capital requirements, "Pillar 2" capital requirements and combined buffer requirements, but does not meet its "Pillar 2" capital guidance, it shall not be subject to such automatic restrictions (including on payments of interest on Additional

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital instruments). In accordance with such expert group
26

considerations, the informal "Pillar 2" capital guidance may be provided by competent authorities if they suspect that an institution may not be able to meet its capital

<<<

 requirements at all times. Such guidance may involve: recommendations to have additional capital, request for a credible capital plan, imposition of other supervisory measures or a stepping-up of supervisory monitoring and competent authorities

<<<

 may, nevertheless, transform them in "Pillar 2" capital requirements. There can be no assurance as to how and when binding effect will be given to the December 2015 EBA Opinion in Denmark, including as to the consequences for an institution

<<<

 of its capital levels falling below those necessary to meet these requirements.
There can be no assurance as to the relationship between any of the aforementioned or future incremental additional own funds requirements, the combined buffer

<<<

 requirement and the restrictions on discretionary payments, including as to the consequences for an institution of its capital levels falling below the combined buffer requirement, the additional own funds requirement and the minimum own funds

<<<

 requirement referred to above. There can also be no assurance as to the manner in which additional own funds requirements may be disclosed publicly in the future and under Danish law certain disclosure rules already apply. A Danish credit institution

<<<

 is required to disclose its additional own funds requirement either twice a year or each quarter. Furthermore, any additional own funds requirement laid down by the Danish FSA is required to be published on the website of the relevant credit

<<<

 institution.
The capital requirements applicable to the Issuer and/or the Group are, by their nature, calculated by reference to a number of factors any one of which or combination of which may not be easily observable or capable of calculation

<<<

 by investors. Noteholders may not be able to predict accurately the proximity of the risk of discretionary payments (of Interest and principal) on the Notes being prohibited from time to time as a result of the operation of Article 141 of the

<<<

 CRD IV Directive as implemented in Denmark.
In addition, CRD IV includes a requirement for credit institutions to calculate, report, monitor and publish their leverage ratios, defined as their Tier 1 capital as a percentage of their total exposure

<<<

 measure. The leverage ratio is required to be maintained at a level of at least 3 per cent. This requirement will be harmonised at EU level from 1 January 2018, until which date regulators may apply such measures as they consider appropriate

<<<

.
The Danish authorities are contemplating potential implementation of a leverage ratio requirement ahead of the finalisation of EU standards. To this end, an expert group was established in 2014, which published its report in December 2015

<<<

. The recommendation of the expert group was, inter alia, that the Danish government shall await harmonised EU standards before any further leverage ratio requirement is implemented into Danish law.
There can be no assurance, however, that the

<<<

 leverage ratio specified above, or any of the minimum own funds Pillar 1 requirements, additional own funds requirements or buffer capital requirements applicable to the Issuer and/or the Group will not be amended in the future to include new

<<<

 and more onerous capital requirements, which in turn may affect the Issuer's capacity to make payments of interest on the Notes. See further the risk factors entitled "Cancellation o fInterest".
Interest rate risks
The Notes will bear interest

<<<

 at a floating rate from and including the Issue Date. The floating rate will be payable quarterly, and will be set immediately prior to any floating Interest Period to the then prevailing STIBOR rate plus the Margin.
Noteholders should be aware

<<<

 that the floating rate interest income is subject to changes to the STIBOR and therefore cannot be anticipated. Hence, Noteholders are not able to determine a definite yield of the Notes at the time of purchase, so that their return on investment

<<<

 cannot be compared with that of investments in simple fixed rate (i.e. fixed rate coupons only) instruments.
In addition, Noteholders are exposed to reinvestment risk with respect to proceeds from coupon payments or early redemptions by the

<<<

 Issuer. If the market yield declines, and if Noteholders want to invest such proceeds in comparable transactions, Noteholders will only be able to reinvest such proceeds in comparable transactions at the then prevailing lower market yields

<<<

.
27

Risks related to the Notes generally
Because the Notes are held by or on behalf o f Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on the clearing system proceduresfor transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer

<<<


The Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in the Global Notes, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are in global form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case

<<<

 may be.
While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to a common depositary. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and

<<<

/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in such a Global Note.
Meetings

<<<

 o fNoteholders and modification
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders

<<<

 including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
In addition, the Issuer may, subject to Condition 8.7 (Conditions to redemption etc.), make any modification

<<<

 to the Notes, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the Agency Agreement and/or the Deed of Covenant which is not prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders without the consent of the Noteholders. Any such modification shall be binding

<<<

 on the Noteholders.
Credit ratings
The Notes are expected to be rated BB+ by S&P. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect

<<<

 the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.
In addition, rating agencies other than S&P may assign unsolicited

<<<

 ratings to the Notes. In such circumstances there can be no assurance that the unsolicited rating(s) will not be lower than the comparable ratings assigned to the Notes by S&P, which could adversely affect the market value and liquidity of

<<<

 the Notes.
The Issuer's credit ratings are important to its business. There can be no assurance that S&P or any other relevant rating agency will not downgrade the ratings of the Issuer or the ratings of the Issuer's debt instruments (including

<<<

 the Notes) either as a result of the financial position of the Jyske Bank Group or changes to applicable rating methodologies used by S&P or any other relevant rating agency. A rating agency's evaluation of the Issuer may also be based on a

<<<

 number of factors not entirely within the control of the Issuer, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Any reduction in the Issuer's credit ratings or the ratings of its debt instruments, including any unsolicited

<<<

 credit rating, could adversely affect its liquidity and competitive position, undermine confidence in the Issuer and the Jyske Bank Group, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets, or limit the range of counterparties

<<<

 willing to enter into transactions with the Issuer and the Jyske Bank Group. Such development could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer and the Jyske Bank Group's business, financial situation, results of operations, liquidity and

<<<

/or prospects.
In general, European regulated investors are restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered

<<<

 under the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended, subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending). Such general restriction will also

<<<

 apply in the case of credit ratings issued by non-EU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant
28

credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with

<<<

 the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered and certified rating agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation

<<<

 is not conclusive evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the updated ESMA list

<<<

. Certain information with respect to the credit rating agencies and ratings is set out on the cover of this Prospectus.
Change o f law
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of this Prospectus

<<<

, save for the provisions of Condition 4 (Status of the Notes), Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes), Condition 8.2 (Early redemption upon the occurrence

<<<

 of a Special Event), and Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) which will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of Denmark. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change

<<<

 to English, Danish or other applicable laws, regulations or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.
Notes where denominations involve integral multiples: Definitive Notes
The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum

<<<

 denomination of SEK2,000,000 plus one or more higher integral multiples of SEK1,000,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples of SEK2,000,000. In such a case a Noteholder who, as a result of

<<<

 trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than SEK2,000,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the remainder of such holding without first purchasing a principal amount of the Notes at or in

<<<

 excess of SEK2,000,000 such that its holding amounts to SEK2,000,000 or above. Further, a Noteholder who, as a result of trading such amount, holds an amount which is less than SEK2,000,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at

<<<

 the relevant time may not receive a Definitive Note in respect of such holding (should Definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of the Notes at or in excess of SEK2,000,000 such that its holding amounts to

<<<

 a denomination.
If Definitive Notes are issued, Noteholders should be aware that Definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of SEK2,000,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Risks related to the market

<<<

 generally
The secondary market generally
The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, the market price and liquidity of the Notes

<<<

 may be adversely affected. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid and any liquidity in such market could be significantly affected by any purchase and cancellation of the Notes by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries as provided

<<<

 in Condition 8. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. This is particularly the case for Notes

<<<

 that are especially sensitive to interest rate, currency or market risks, are designed for specific investment objectives or strategies or have been structured to meet the investment requirements of limited categories of investors. Illiquidity

<<<

 may have an adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.
Exchange rate risks and exchange controls
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in Swedish Krona. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if

<<<

 an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than Swedish Krona. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to

<<<

 devaluation of Swedish Krona or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency

<<<

 relative to Swedish Krona would
29

decrease (1) the Investor's Currency equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency equivalent market value

<<<

 of the Notes. Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected

<<<

, or no interest or principal. Euro and Eurozone Risk Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could

<<<

 adversely affect the value of the Notes. As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, in particular in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Financial

<<<

 Stability Mechanism to provide funding to Eurozone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. Despite these measures, some residual concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries, particularly Greece

<<<

, and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. These and other

<<<

 concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Member States, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning

<<<

 these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The United Kingdom's proposed exitfrom the EU On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum to decide on the United Kingdom's membership of the EU. The result

<<<

 of the vote was to leave the EU. There are a number of uncertainties in connection with the future of the United Kingdom and its relationship with the EU. The negotiation of the United Kingdom's exit terms is likely to take a number of years

<<<

. Until the terms and timing of the United Kingdom's exit from the EU are clearer, it is not possible to determine the impact that the referendum, the United Kingdom's departure from the EU and/or any related matters may have on the business

<<<

 of the Issuer. As such, no assurance can be given that such matters would not adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes and/or the market value and/or the liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market

<<<

OVERVIEW OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES

<<<

 WHILE IN GLOBAL FORM
Words and expressions defined in "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes " herein shall have the same meanings in this "Overview o fProvisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form ".
Temporary Global Note exchangeable

<<<

 for Permanent Global Note
The Notes will initially be in the form of the Temporary Global Note, without Coupons, which will be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Interests

<<<

 in the Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable, in whole or in part, for interests in the Permanent Global Note, without Coupons, which will also be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

, Luxembourg, on or after the Exchange Date, upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership. Interest payments in respect of the Notes cannot be collected without such certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership.
Whenever any interest

<<<

 in the Temporary Global Note is to be exchanged for an interest in the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer shall procure (in the case of first exchange) the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of the Permanent Global Note, duly authenticated

<<<

, to the bearer of the Temporary Global Note or (in the case of any subsequent exchange of a part of the Temporary Global Note) an increase in the principal amount of the Permanent Global Note in accordance with its terms against:
(i) presentation

<<<

 and (in the case of final exchange) surrender of the Temporary Global Note to or to the order of the Issuing Agent; and
(ii) in either case, receipt by the Issuing Agent of a certificate or certificates of non-U.S. beneficial ownership,
within

<<<

 seven days of the bearer requesting such exchange.
The Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note shall be equal to the aggregate of the original principal amounts specified in the certificates of non

<<<

-U.S. beneficial ownership as adjusted to reflect any reduction and/or reinstatement pursuant to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) and/or any reduction as otherwise required by then current

<<<

 legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer; provided, however, that in no circumstances shall the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note exceed the initial principal amount of the Temporary

<<<

 Global Note.
Permanent Global Note exchangeable for Definitive Notes
Interests in the Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable, in whole but not in part only and at the request of the bearer of the Permanent Global Note, for Definitive Notes

<<<

, if:
(i) Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other relevant clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention permanently to cease business

<<<

 or in fact does so; or
(ii) any of the circumstances described in Condition 11 (Enforcement Events) occurs.
Interests in the Permanent Global Note will also become exchangeable, in whole but not in part only and at the request of the Issuer

<<<

, for Definitive Notes if, by reason of any change in the laws of Denmark, the Issuer will be required to make any withholding or deduction from any payment in respect of the Notes which would not be required if the Notes are in definitive form

<<<

.
Definitive Notes will have attached thereto at the time of their initial delivery Coupons. Definitive Notes will also, if necessary, have attached thereto at the time of their initial delivery Talons and the expression Coupons shall, where

<<<

 the context so requires, include Talons.
Whenever the Permanent Global Note is to be exchanged for Definitive Notes, the Issuer shall procure the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of such Definitive Notes, duly authenticated and

<<<

 with Coupons and, if
34

necessary, Talons attached, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note to the bearer of the Permanent Global Note against the surrender

<<<

 of the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Issuing Agent within thirty days of the bearer requesting such exchange.
Each Definitive Note shall state that its Outstanding Principal Amount may be reduced and/or reinstated pursuant

<<<

 to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event and Reinstatement of the Notes) or reduced as otherwise required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Issuer and that details thereof may be obtained during

<<<

 normal business hours at the Specified Office of the Issuing Agent.
The Permanent Global Note also provides, inter alia, that:
(i) if Definitive Notes have not been delivered in accordance with the terms of the Permanent Global Note by 6.0

<<<

0 p.m. (London time) on the thirtieth day after the day on which such Permanent Global Note becomes due to be exchanged; or
(ii) if the Permanent Global Note (or any part thereof) becomes due and payable in accordance with the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 or the date for final redemption of the Permanent Global Note has occurred, and, in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due with all accrued interest thereon has not been made on the due date for payment by 6.00

<<<

 p.m. (London time) on such due date,
then the Permanent Global Note will become void in accordance with its terms but without prejudice to the rights conferred by the Deed of Covenant.
Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes
The Terms

<<<

 and Conditions applicable to any Definitive Note will be endorsed on that Note and will consist of the Terms and Conditions set out under "Terms and Conditions of the Notes" below.
The Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes represented

<<<

 by one or more Global Notes will differ from those Terms and Conditions which would apply to the Notes were they in definitive form to the extent described in this "Overview o fProvisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form"
Each Global

<<<

 Note will contain provisions which modify the Terms and Conditions of the Notes as they apply to the relevant Global Note. The following is a summary of certain of those provisions:
Payments: The holder of a Global Note shall be the only person

<<<

 entitled to receive payments in respect of the Notes represented by such Global Note and the Issuer will be discharged by payment to, or to the order of, the holder of such Global Note in respect of each amount so paid. Each of the persons

<<<

 shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the beneficial holder of a particular nominal amount of the Notes represented by such Global Note must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be,

<<<

 for his share of each payment so made by the Issuer to, or to the order of, the holder of such Global Note. For the purpose of any payments made in respect of a Global Note, the relevant place of presentation shall be disregarded in the definition

<<<

 of "Payment Business Day" set out in Condition 2.1 (Definitions).
Notices: Notwithstanding Condition 16 (Notices), while all the Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes and such Global Note(s) are held in their entirety on behalf

<<<

 of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system, the requirement in Condition 16 (Notices) for a notice to be published in a leading English language daily newspaper having general circulation in Europe

<<<

 shall not apply and notices to Noteholders may instead be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system for communication by them to the persons shown in their

<<<

 respective records as having interests therein and, in any case, such notices shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (Notices) on the date of delivery to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg

<<<

 and/or any other relevant clearing system.
Legend concerning United States persons
Permanent Global Notes, Definitive Notes and any Coupons and Talons appertaining thereto will bear a legend to the following effect:
35

"Any United States

<<<

 person who holds this obligation will be subject to limitations under the United States income tax laws, including the limitations provided in Sections 165(j) and 1287(a) of the Internal Revenue Code." Clearing Systems Any reference herein

<<<

 to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, shall, whenever the context so permits, be deemed to include a reference to any additional or alternative clearing system approved by the Issuer, the Principal Paying Agent and

<<<

 the Noteholders.
36

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES
Thefollowing is the text o f the Terms and Conditions o f the Notes which will be endorsed on each Definitive Note. The Terms and Conditions applicable to any Global Note will differ from

<<<

 those Terms and Conditions which would apply to a Definitive Note to the extent described under "Overview o f Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form " above.

1.

Introduction

The SEK1,250,000,000 Floating Rate Perpetual Non

<<<

-cumulative Additional Tier 1 Capital Notes (the "Notes") are issued by Jyske Bank A/S (the "Issuer").

The Notes and the Coupons (as defined below) are issued with the benefit of an Agency Agreement (the "Agency Agreement") dated 16 September

<<<

 2016 between the Issuer and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as issuing agent (in such capacity, the "Issuing Agent", which expression shall include any successor issuing agent) and as principal paying agent (in such capacity, the

<<<

 "Principal Paying Agent", which expression shall include any additional or successor principal paying agent, and together with any additional or successor paying agents, the "Paying Agents").
The Notes and the Coupons are issued with the benefit

<<<

 of a deed of covenant entered into by the Issuer in favour of the Noteholders (as defined below) dated 16 September 2016 (the "Deed of Covenant").

Certain provisions of these Terms and Conditions (the "Conditions") are summaries of the Agency

<<<

 Agreement and the Deed of Covenant and are subject to their detailed provisions. The holders of the Notes (the "Noteholders") and the holders of the interest coupons (the "Couponholders" and the "Coupons", respectively) are bound by, and are

<<<

 deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the Agency Agreement and the Deed of Covenant applicable to them.

Copies of the Agency Agreement and the Deed of Covenant are available for inspection by Noteholders during normal business hours

<<<

 at the specified office of each of the Paying Agents.

 point of such reduction, taking into account the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (if any) of the Issuer and/or the Group, as the case may be, generated on or prior to the Write Down Date by the pro rata reduction to, or, as the case

<<<

 may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal amount of all Other Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) outstanding at such time,

provided that:

(a)

with respect to each such Other Loss Absorbing Instrument

<<<

 (if any), such pro rata

reduction or, as the case may be, conversion shall only be taken into account as

described above to the extent required to restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital

Ratio of the Issuer and/or the Group, as applicable

<<<

, to the Trigger Event Threshold or,

if lower, such Other Loss Absorbing Instrument's trigger level; and

(b)

to the extent the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity

Tier 1 Capital instruments of, the principal

<<<

 amount of any Other Loss Absorbing

Instrument is not, or by the relevant Write Down Date will not be, effective for any

reason:

(x)

the ineffectiveness of any such reduction or, as the case may be, conversion

into Common Equity Tier 1

<<<

 Capital instruments shall not prejudice the

requirement to effect a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts

pursuant to this Condition 7.1; and

(y)

the reduction to, or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity

Tier 1 Capital

<<<

 instruments of, the principal amount of any Other Loss

Absorbing Instrument which is not, or by the Write Down Date will not be,

46

effective shall not be taken into account in determining such reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts

<<<

,
and
(ii) the amount of a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts that would reduce the Outstanding Principal Amounts to the Loss Absorption Minimum Amount.
If, in connection with the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts or

<<<

 the calculation of the amount of the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts, there are any Other Loss Absorbing Instruments that may be reduced, or, as the case may be, converted into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments in full

<<<

 (save for any floor equivalent to the Loss Absorption Minimum Amount) but not in part only ("Full Loss Absorbing Instruments"), then:
(I) the requirement that a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1 shall

<<<

 be effected pro rata with the reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments, as the case may be, of any Other Loss Absorbing Instruments shall not be construed as requiring the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts to be reduced in full simply by virtue of the fact that any Full Loss Absorbing Instruments will be reduced or, as the case may be, converted in full; and
(II) for the purposes of calculating the reduction of the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts, any Full Loss Absorbing Instruments will be treated (for the purposes only of determining the reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments among the Notes and all Other Loss Absorbing Instruments

<<<

 on a pro rata basis) as if their terms permitted partial reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments, such that the reduction or, as the case may be, conversion into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital

<<<

 instruments of such Full Loss Absorbing Instruments shall be deemed to occur in two concurrent stages:
(A) the principal amount of such Full Loss Absorbing Instruments shall be reduced or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments

<<<

 pro rata with the Notes and all Other Loss Absorbing Instruments (in each case subject to and as provided in this Condition 7.1) to the extent necessary to restore each of the Issuer and/or the Group's (as the case may be) Common Equity Tier

<<<

 1 Capital Ratio to at least the Trigger Event Threshold; and
(B) the balance (if any) of the principal amount of such Full Loss Absorbing Instruments remaining following (A) above shall be reduced or, as the case may be, converted into Common

<<<

 Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments with the effect of increasing the Issuer's and/or the Group's, as the case may be, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio above the minimum required level under (A) above.
The Issuer's determination of the relevant

<<<

 amount of a reduction to the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1 shall be binding on all parties.
Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts as described above, interest will continue to accrue on the

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amounts following such reduction, and will be subject to Condition 6 and Condition 7.2 as described herein.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note shall, upon the reduction of the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amounts described above, be reduced on a likewise pro rata basis.
Any reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts pursuant to this Condition 7.1 shall not constitute an event of default under the Notes.
47

7.2 Reinstatement of

<<<

 the Notes: Following a reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts in accordance with Condition 7.1, the Issuer may, at its discretion, reinstate some or all of the principal amount of the Notes, subject to compliance with the CRD IV requirements

<<<

 and the Reinstatement Limit, on a pro rata basis with all other Parity Trigger Loss Absorbing Instruments (if any) which would, following such reinstatement, constitute Additional Tier 1 Capital and feature similar write down and reinstatement

<<<

 provisions.
7.3 Reinstatement Limit: Any reinstatement of some or all of the principal amount of all relevant outstanding Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, where the principal amount of such Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments has been

<<<

 reduced, may not at any time exceed the reinstatement limit applicable to the Issuer and the Group at such time (the "Reinstatement Limit"). Subject to Condition 7.5, the Reinstatement Limit will be the lower of the Available Reinstatement

<<<

 Amounts calculated for each of the Issuer and the Group in accordance with Condition 7.4.
7.4 Available Reinstatement Amounts: The "Available Reinstatement Amount" for each of the Issuer and the Group will be calculated as the amount equal

<<<

 to the profits of (in the case of the calculation of the Issuer's Available Reinstatement Amount) the Issuer or (in the case of the Group's Available Reinstatement Amount) the Group, in each case after the Issuer or the Group, as the case may

<<<

 be, has taken a formal decision confirming its final profits, multiplied by the ratio of the Original Principal Amount of all relevant outstanding Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, where the principal amount of such Additional Tier 1 Capital

<<<

 instruments has been reduced, divided by the total Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer or the Group, as the case may be, in each case at the date of the relevant reinstatement, less:
(1) with respect to any relevant Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments

<<<

, where the principal amount has been reduced, the sum of any principal amounts that have already been reinstated during the period to which such profits relate; and
(ii) the sum of any amounts of interest or, as the case may be, other periodic

<<<

 distributions in respect of any relevant Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments, where the principal amount has been reduced, and which were paid or have been calculated (but disregarding any such interest which has been cancelled) during the

<<<

 period to which such profits relate on the basis of an outstanding principal amount which is lower than the Original Principal Amount of such Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments.
7.5 Maximum Distributable Amount restriction: A reinstatement

<<<

 as described above shall not be effected in circumstances which (when aggregated together with distributions of the kind referred to in Article 141 (2) of the CRD IV Directive or, as the case may be, any provision of Danish law transposing

<<<

 or implementing Article 141 (2) of the CRD IV Directive, or any successor thereto) would cause a breach of any regulatory restriction or prohibition on payments on Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments relating to any Maximum Distributable

<<<

 Amount.
7.6 Miscellaneous provisions applicable to reinstatement: For the avoidance of doubt, at no time may the Outstanding Principal Amounts exceed the Original Principal Amount of the Notes.
To the extent that the principal amount of the

<<<

 Notes has been reinstated as described above, interest shall begin to accrue on the reinstated principal amount of the Notes, and become payable in accordance with the Conditions, as from the date of the relevant reinstatement.
7.7 No liability

<<<

: None of the Issuing Agent and any Paying Agent shall have any responsibility for, or liability or obligation in respect of, any loss, claim or demand incurred as a result of or in connection with a Trigger Event or any consequent write-down

<<<

, reduction and/or cancellation of the Notes or of any claims in respect thereof. None of the Issuing Agent and any Paying Agent shall be responsible for any calculation or determination, or the verification of any calculation or determination

<<<

, in connection with the same.

<<<

 of the Issuer in respect of any such Notes shall be discharged.

8.6 Substitution and variation: Subject to Condition 8.7 and having given no less than thirty nor more than sixty days' notice to the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition

 16) and the Principal Paying Agent, if a Special Event has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer may substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes or vary the terms of all (but not some only) of the Notes, without any requirement for the

<<<

 consent or approval of the Noteholders, so that they become or remain Qualifying Capital Notes.

Any such notice shall specify the relevant details of the manner in which such substitution or variation shall take effect and where the Noteholders

<<<

 Issuer has delivered a certificate signed by two of its directors to the Principal Paying Agent (and copies thereof will be available at the Principal Paying Agent's specified office during its normal business hours) not less than 5 Business

<<<

 Days prior to the date set for redemption that such Special Event has occurred or will occur no more than ninety days following the date fixed for redemption, as the case may be.

In addition, if the Issuer has elected to substitute or vary

<<<

<<<

 in Section 1471(b) of the Code or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, or (without prejudice to Condition 10) any law implementing

<<<

 an intergovernmental approach thereto. No commissions or expenses shall be charged to the Noteholders in respect of such payments.

<<<

 in respect of any such delay.
9.6 Payments other than in respect of matured Coupons: Payments of interest other than in respect of matured Coupons shall be made only against presentation of the relevant Notes at the specified office of any

<<<

, or any political sub-division of, or any authority in, or of, the Kingdom of Denmark having power to tax, unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required by law. In that event, in the case of a payment of interest only, the Issuer

<<<

 destroyed, it may be replaced, subject to applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange or other relevant authority regulations, at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Paying Agent, as the case may be, as may

<<<

 from time to time be designated by the Issuer for the purpose and notice of whose designation is given to Noteholders, in each case on payment by the claimant of the fees and costs incurred in connection therewith and on such terms as to evidence

<<<

, security and indemnity (which may provide, inter alia, that if the allegedly lost, stolen or destroyed Note, Coupon or Talon is subsequently presented for payment or, as the case may be, for exchange for further Coupons, there shall be paid

<<<

 to the Issuer on demand the amount payable by the Issuer in respect of such Notes, Coupons or further Coupons) and otherwise as the Issuer may require. Mutilated or defaced Notes, Coupons or Talons must be surrendered before replacements will

<<<

 be issued.
14. Appointment of Agents
The Issuing Agent, Principal Paying Agent and the Paying Agents initially appointed by the Issuer and their respective specified offices are listed below. The Issuing Agent, Principal Paying Agent and the

<<<

 Paying Agents act solely as agents of the Issuer and do not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any Noteholder or Couponholder. The Issuer is entitled (a) to vary or terminate the appointment of the Issuing

<<<

 Agent, the Principal Paying Agent or any other Paying Agent, (b) to appoint additional or other Paying Agents and/or (c) to approve any changes in the specified office through which any such entity acts, provided that: (i) the Issuer shall

Notice of any such change or any change of any specified office shall promptly be given to the Noteholders.
15. Meetings of Noteholders; Modification
15.1 Meetings of Noteholders: The Agency Agreement

<<<

 contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders to consider any matter affecting their interests, including the modification by Extraordinary Resolution of any of these Conditions. The quorum at any meeting for passing an Extraordinary

<<<

 Resolution will be two or more persons present holding or representing a clear majority in the Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting, one or more persons present whatever the

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes held or represented by him or them, except that at any meeting, the business of which includes the modification of certain of these Conditions in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Agency

<<<

 Agreement, the necessary quorum for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons present holding or representing not less than three-quarters (or at any adjourned meeting, one-quarter) of the Outstanding Principal Amounts

<<<

 of the Notes for the time being outstanding. An Extraordinary Resolution passed at any meeting of the Noteholders will be binding on all Noteholders, whether or not they are present at the meeting, and on all Couponholders.
The Agency Agreement

<<<

 provides that a resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of the holders of not less than 90 per cent. in Outstanding Principal Amounts of the Notes shall for all purposes be as valid and effective as an Extraordinary Resolution passed at

<<<

 a meeting of Noteholders duly convened and held. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders.
15.2 Modification of Notes: The Issuer

<<<

 may make, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders:
(i) any modification to the Notes, the Conditions, the Agency Agreement and/or the Deed of Covenant to correct a manifest error; or
(ii) subject to Condition 8.7, any modification

<<<

 to the Notes, the Conditions, the Agency Agreement and/or the Deed of Covenant which, in the sole opinion of the Issuer, is not prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders and the Couponholders.
52

Any such modification to the Agency

<<<

 Agreement shall be subject to the agreement of the Principal Paying Agent. Subject as provided in the Conditions, no other modification may be made to the Notes, the Conditions, the Agency Agreement or the Deed of Covenant except with the sanction

<<<

 of an Extraordinary Resolution and, in the case of a modification to the Agency Agreement, the consent of the Principal Paying Agent.
Any such modification shall be binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders and any such modification

<<<

 shall be notified to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 as soon as practicable thereafter.
16. Notices
Notices to the Noteholders shall be valid if published in a leading daily newspaper of general circulation in Europe (which

<<<

 is expected to be the Financial Times) and (so long as the Notes are admitted to listing on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc's market for listed securities) in a leading newspaper

<<<

 having general circulation in London (which is expected to be the Financial Times). The Issuer shall also ensure that notices are duly published in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of the London Stock Exchange (so long

<<<

 as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on its Regulated Market) or any other stock exchange on which the Notes are for the time being listed. Any such notice will be deemed to have

<<<

 been given on the date of publication or, if published more than once on different dates, on the date of first publication. If publication as provided above is not practicable, notice will be validly given if published in another leading daily

<<<

 English language newspaper with general circulation in Europe.
Couponholders shall be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the Noteholders in accordance with this Condition 16.
17. Contracts (Rights

<<<

18. Governing Law and Jurisdiction; Statutory Resolution Power
18.1 Governing

<<<

 Law: The Notes, the Agency Agreement and the Deed of Covenant, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with them are governed by, and will be construed in accordance with, English law, save for Condition 4, Condition

<<<

 6, Condition 7, Condition 8.2 and Condition 11 which are governed by, and will be construed in accordance with, the laws of the Kingdom of Denmark.
18.2 Jurisdiction: The courts of England are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes that

<<<

 may arise out of or in connection with the Notes or Coupons and, accordingly, any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Notes or Coupons ("Proceedings") may be brought in such courts. The Issuer irrevocably submits

<<<

 to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to Proceedings in such courts on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of each

<<<

 of the Noteholders and Couponholders and shall not affect the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings

<<<

 in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).
18.3 Service of Process: The Issuer irrevocably appoints Kromann Reumert, 42 New Broad Street, London EC2M 1JD, England as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings

<<<

 in England based on any of the Notes or Coupons. If, for any reason, the Issuer does not have such agent in England, it will promptly appoint a substitute process agent and notify the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 of such appointment

<<<

. Nothing herein shall affect the right to service process in any other manner permitted by law.
53

18.4 Statutory Resolution Power: By its acquisition of the Notes, each Noteholder (which, for these purposes, includes each holder of a beneficial

<<<

 interest in the Notes) also acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the exercise of, any Bail-in Power by the relevant Danish resolution authority that may result in the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amounts of, or distributions on, the Notes and/or the conversion of all, or a portion, of the Outstanding Principal Amounts of, or distributions on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of the Issuer or another person

<<<

, including by means of a variation to the terms of the Notes to give effect to the exercise by the relevant Danish resolution authority of such Bail-in Power. Each Noteholder (which, for these purposes, includes each holder of a beneficial

<<<

 interest in the Notes) further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the Noteholders are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, so as to give effect to, the exercise of any Bail-in Power by the relevant Danish resolution authority

<<<

.
For the avoidance of doubt, the potential reduction or cancellation of all or a portion of the Outstanding Principal Amounts of, or distributions on, the Notes or the conversion of the Notes into shares, other securities or other obligations

<<<

 in connection with the exercise of any Bail-in Power by the relevant Danish resolution authority is separate and distinct from a conversion or reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts following a Trigger Event although these events may

<<<

 occur consecutively.
For these purposes, a "Bail-in Power" means any statutory reduction and/or conversion power existing from time to time under any laws, regulations, rules or requirements relating to the resolution of credit institutions

<<<

, investment firms and/or Group Entities incorporated in the relevant Member State of the European Union in effect and applicable in the relevant Member State of the European Union to the Issuer and/or other Group Entities, including but not

<<<

 limited to any such laws, regulations, rules or requirements that are implemented, adopted or enacted within the context of any European Union directive or regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for

<<<

 the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and/or within the context of a relevant Member State of the European Union's resolution regime or otherwise, pursuant to which liabilities of a credit institution, investment

<<<

 firm and/or any Group Entities can be reduced, cancelled and/or converted into shares or other notes or obligations of the obligor or any other person.
Upon the Issuer being informed or notified by the relevant Danish resolution authority of

<<<

 the actual exercise of the date from which the Bail-in Power is effective with respect to the Notes, the Issuer shall notify the Noteholders without delay. Any delay or failure by the Issuer to give notice shall not affect the validity and

<<<

 enforceability of the Bail-in Power nor the effects on the Notes described in this clause.
The exercise of the Bail-in Power by the relevant Danish resolution authority with respect to the Notes shall not constitute an Enforcement Event or

<<<

 an event of default under the Notes and the terms and conditions of the Notes shall continue to apply in relation to the Outstanding Principal Amounts of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, the Notes, subject to any modification of

<<<

 the amount of distributions payable to reflect the reduction of the Outstanding Principal Amounts, and any further modification of the terms and conditions of the Notes that the relevant Danish resolution authority may decide in accordance

<<<

 with applicable laws and regulations relating to the resolution of credit institutions, investment firms and/or Group Entities incorporated in the relevant Member State of the European Union.
Each Noteholder also acknowledges and agrees that

<<<

 this provision is exhaustive on the matters described herein to the exclusion of any other agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the application of any Bail-in Power to the Notes.
54

USE OF PROCEEDS The issue of the Notes

<<<

 will form part of the Issuer's capital base and the net proceeds of the issue of the Notes will be applied by the Issuer for general corporate purposes.

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REVIEW
Systemically Important Financial Institutions In

<<<

 June 2014, the Danish FSA appointed six Danish SIFIs: Danske Bank A/S ("Danske"), Nykredit Realkredit A/S ("Nykredit"), Nordea Bank Danmark A/S ("Nordea"), the Issuer, Sydbank A/S and DLR Kredit A/S. The SIFIs were identified in accordance

<<<

 with Section 308 of the Danish Financial Business Act. On 26 June 2015 and on 29 June 2016, the Issuer was re-appointed as a SIFI. Institution-specific SIFI buffers (the systemic risk buffers) between 1 and 3 per cent. were set according to

<<<

 quantitative SIFI criteria and will be phased in gradually from 2015 to 2019. The additional CET1 (as defined below) requirement of the Jyske Bank Group, beyond the requirement as per CRD IV (the SIFI buffer), was set at 1.5 per cent.
According

<<<

 to the political agreement on SIFIs from October 2013, the final capital requirements imposed on Danish SIFIs must be on a par with the requirements set in other comparable European countries. Consequently, the final level of the Danish SIFI

<<<

 capital requirements will be assessed no later than 2017 after evaluating a basket of comparable final SIFI requirements set by other European countries.
Danish implementation of the CRD IV Directive and CRR In line with other European banks

<<<

, Danish banks must also comply with the CRD IV Directive and the CRR. Both have come into force in Denmark in 2014, the CRD IV Directive through implementation of the Danish Financial Business Act, whereas the CRR applies directly without implementation

<<<

 in national law. The phase-in of the capital requirements is expected to follow the path in the CRR until 2018 unless already required under applicable Danish legislation. The CRR and CRD IV Directive framework implements, among other things

<<<

, the Basel III reforms in the European Union covering a wide range of prudential requirements, including capital requirements, stricter and aligned definitions of capital, REA, leverage ratio, large exposure framework and liquidity and funding

<<<

 requirements. The CRD IV Directive covers the overall supervisory framework for banks (including the individual Pillar II risk assessment) and other measures such as the combined capital buffer requirements, SIFI definition, governance and

<<<

 remuneration requirements. The EBA will propose (or in some cases, has already proposed) detailed rules through binding technical standards during the period from 2013 to 2016 for many areas including, inter alia, liquidity requirements and

<<<

 certain aspects of capital requirements.
Capital requirements Under the CRD IV Directive and the CRR, the minimum capital requirement for Common Equity Tier 1 capital ("CET1" or "Common Equity Tier 1 Capital") will be phased in gradually to

<<<

 9.5 per cent. of REA over the period from 2014 until 2019. The 9.5 per cent. requirement includes a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5 per cent. and a counter-cyclical buffer requirement of up to 2.5 per cent. in addition to the

<<<

 minimum requirement of 4.5 per cent. The counter-cyclical buffer requirement will apply in periods of excess lending growth in the economy and can vary for each jurisdiction. If a bank does not maintain these buffers, in excess of the 4.5 per

<<<

 cent. CET1 minimum requirement, certain restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and make other payments.
For each SIFI there will be an additional CET1 capital requirement, a so-called SIFI buffer

<<<

 or systemic risk buffer, on top of the minimum requirements. The SIFI buffer is set individually on a national level according to the systemic importance of the bank. Apart from the breakdown of capital into the minimum CET1 requirement of

<<<

 4.5 per cent. and the combined buffer requirement (capital conservation, counter-cyclical and SIFI buffer), the CRD IV Directive distinguishes between Pillar I and Pillar II capital requirements. The Pillar I capital requirement was fully implemented

<<<

 by 2015 and set at 8 per cent. of REA, consisting of the minimum of 4.5 per cent. of CET1, up to 1.5 per cent. of Additional Tier 1 Capital and up to 2 per cent. of Tier 2 capital. The Pillar II requirement is the difference between an institution

<<<

's individual solvency requirement and the 8 per cent. Pillar I requirement. In Denmark, the Danish FSA pile the Pillar II requirement up on top of the Pillar I requirement of 8 per cent. as a cushion below the combined buffers.
56

In addition

<<<

 to the higher capital requirements, the CRR has a stricter criteria for determining the quality of capital that may count as Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 capital. Additional Tier 1 Capital must therefore be converted into CET1 at a

<<<

 trigger point of 5.125 per cent. of CET1, and Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 capital must have no incentive to be redeemed before the contractual maturity, which means any capital including step-up structures is not accepted as Tier 

<<<

2 under the CRR. Furthermore, CRR also implies stricter requirements for the calculation of REA. The CRR includes grandfathering rules for Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments and Tier 2 instruments issued before 31 December 2011. Any Additional

<<<

 Tier 1 Capital instruments or Tier 2 instruments issued after 31 December 2011, which are not compliant with CRR will not be eligible for grandfathering under the CRR. The phasing out of old Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments and Tier 2

<<<

 capital instruments eligible for grandfathering are based on a stepwise reduction of 20 per cent. in 2014 and subsequent 10 per cent. annual reductions until 2022, by which point any such capital instruments will have been completely phased

<<<

 out. The grandfathering bucket for each of the years from 2014 until 2021 is calculated based on the total nominal amount of outstanding and grandfathering compliant Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments and Tier 2 instruments as per 31 December

<<<

 2012. The CRD IV Directive and the CRR include a requirement for credit institutions to calculate, report and monitor their leverage ratios, defined as their CET1 and Additional Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of total non-weighted exposure

<<<

. The leverage ratios will be assessed under Pillar II (as defined under Basel III) while awaiting a subsequent political decision in the European Union on whether this should be a Pillar I (as defined under Basel III) assessment. The leverage

<<<

 ratio is a risk-neutral measure for the maximum extent of the balance-sheet leverage. A high leverage ratio may cause an institution to be exposed to risks linked to sudden changes in market conditions and significant price falls on assets

<<<

 with ensuing losses. At present, no statutory requirement has been established based on the leverage ratio, but the decision on such a requirement must be taken by the end of 2016. A requirement of a maximum leverage ratio will, if necessary

<<<

, be introduced to take effect as of 2018. So far, an indicative benchmark of 3 per cent. has been indicated, corresponding to a maximum leverage of 33 times an institution's core capital. Liquidity requirements The Net Stable Funding Ratio

<<<

 (the "NSFR") is intended to ensure a sound funding structure by promoting an increase in long-dated funding of financial institutions. The NSFR stipulates that at all times financial institutions must have stable funding equal to the amount

<<<

 of their illiquid assets for one year ahead. The focus of the NSFR is to minimise the duration mismatch in the balance sheets of the relevant bank. The Basel Committee published a final revised version of the 2010 proposal of the NSFR in October

<<<

 2014 and it is expected that it will be gradually implemented from 2018. On 15 December 2015, the EBA published a report on the impact assessment and calibration of the NSFR, recommending the introduction of the NSFR in the EU to ensure stable

<<<

 funding structures and as a way of properly mitigating funding risk in banks.

DESCRIPTION OF JYSKE BANK A/S AND THE JYSKE BANK GROUP
The Issuer The Jyske Bank Group is the fourth largest financial service provider on the Danish market

<<<

. The corporate structure of the Jyske Bank Group (with the most significant 100 per cent. owned subsidiaries) is shown below:
Jyske Bank A/S is the parent company of the Jyske Bank Group and, measured by total assets, is the third largest bank

<<<

 in the Danish market for bank lending and the second largest Danish-owned bank. BRFkredit is the fourth largest Danish mortgage institution. As at the end of June 2016, the Jyske Bank Group's total assets amounted to DKK 564.5 billion and the

<<<

 Jyske Bank Group employed approximately 3,977 full-time employees. The Jyske Bank Group also comprises the leasing company Jyske Finans A/S, as well as international interests in the form of a branch in Hamburg and the provision of investment

<<<

 advice to international private banking clients in Gibraltar, Cannes and Copenhagen. The Jyske Bank Group has a strong nationwide market presence in Denmark with a market share of around 10 per cent. in terms of total bank lending to customers

<<<

, total bank deposits from customers and aggregate Danish mortgage lending. In Denmark, the Jyske Bank Group (as at the end of June 2016) operates 96 branches focusing on retail clients, 30 branches specialised in small and medium enterprises

<<<

 ("SME") and corporate clients and 10 private banking branches. Leasing activities are performed by the Bank's subsidiary Jyske Finans. The Bank's registered and head office is situated at Vestergade 8-16, DK 8600 Silkeborg. Its telephone number

<<<

 is +45 89 89 89 89 and the Bank is registered with the Danish Business Authority under CVR number 17616617. History and development The Bank was established as a public limited company on 7 July 1967 following the merger of four banks based

<<<

 in central Jutland. Through further mergers the Bank achieved nationwide retail branch coverage in the 1980s. During the post financial crisis years, Jyske Bank strengthened its market position in Denmark by acquiring smaller bank lending portfolios

<<<

, such as the leasing activities of Finans Nord A/S and Easyfleet A/S and the purchase of the profitable parts of Fjordbank Mors from the Financial Stability Cooperation in 2011. In 2013, Jyske Bank acquired all of the small regional bank Sparekassen

<<<

 Lolland A/S's banking activities. In 2012, Jyske Bank and BRFkredit signed an agreement on joint funding. The agreement gave Jyske Bank access to cost efficient long-term financing of the residential bank loan products "Jyske Prioritet home

<<<

 loans" granted on the basis of collateral in the homeowner's house, through the issue of Danish mortgage bonds ("SDO") by BRFkredit.
58

In 2014, the Jyske Bank Group took the largest step in its corporate history to strengthen its market

<<<

 position by merging with BRFkredit. The purchase price for all shares in BRFkredit was determined at DKK 7.1 billion, of which DKK 100 million was paid in cash and the rest by issuance of new shares in Jyske Bank to BRF Holding A/S which became

<<<

 the largest shareholder in Jyske Bank A/S with an ownership stake of 25 per cent. The merger doubled the size of the balance sheet of the Jyske Bank Group and tripled its lending portfolio. Furthermore, it improved diversification of the balance

<<<

 sheet, thereby lowering the risk profile for the total earnings.
BRFkredit's activities date back to 1959. The main activity of BRFkredit is mortgage lending secured against real property in Denmark.
During 2014, Jyske Bank divested two non

<<<

-core activities, selling (i) its wholly-owned subsidiary Silkeborg Data A/S, a leading provider of payroll and staff administration systems to the public sector, and (ii) its 60 per cent. stake in the investment company, Berben's Effectenkantoor

<<<

 B.V., in the Netherlands.
In February 2015, Jyske Bank and Nykredit entered into an agreement on the specific terms and conditions for Jyske Bank's exit from the Totalkredit cooperation, including sale of the Jyske Bank's shares in Pengeinstitutternes

<<<

 Realkreditselskab A/S ("PRAS"). PRAS is a company that owns shares in Nykredit Holding A/S and DLR Kredit A/S.
In March 2015, a decision was made to wind up Jyske Bank Schweiz which has been owned by Jyske Bank since 1981. The unit no longer

<<<

 met the Jyske Bank Group's required rate of return, and there were no prospects for future improvement of profitability. All banking activities in Switzerland have been discontinued, and the banking licence was returned in February 2016.
The

<<<

 Danish Banking Sector
As at the end of 2015, there were a total of 78 banks and 6 mortgage institutions regulated by the Danish FSA present in the Danish market. The Danish banking sector is both highly concentrated and fragmented and consists

<<<

 of several different types of financial groups, banks and mortgage institutions.
The Danish market is dominated by four financial services groups and first-tier banks and mortgage institutions, Danske, Nordea, Nykredit and the Bank. Danske

<<<

 and Nordea are both pan-Nordic financial conglomerates, and their mortgage activities in Denmark are carried out via its subsidiaries Realkredit Danmark A/S and Nordea Kredit Realkreditaktieselskab respectively. Danske is the largest financial

<<<

 conglomerate in Denmark, whereas Nordea is the largest financial conglomerate in the Nordic region, with Danske being the second largest. Nykredit is the largest Danish mortgage institution and its banking activities are conducted via its subsidiary

<<<

 Nykredit Bank A/S. The Jyske Bank Group is the fourth largest financial services group in the Danish market, and its mortgage activities are carried out via its subsidiary BRFkredit.
The second-tier Danish banks are Sydbank A/S and Spar Nord

<<<

 Bank A/S. Foreign competition in the Danish banking market is primarily from Handelsbanken (branch of Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ)) and a Copenhagen based branch of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB ("SEB"). The rest of the market for bank

<<<

 lending is highly fragmented, comprising many small and medium-sized regional banks with strong local franchises and niche strategies, and individual market shares around or significantly below 1 per cent. of total bank lending.
The Danish

<<<

 mortgage lending market is the biggest lending market in Denmark with total mortgage lending of DKK 2,634 billion as of 31 December 2015, including lending from the independent and specialised mortgage institution DLR Kredit A/S. In comparison

<<<

, total bank lending of Danish commercial banks to domestic Danish SME, corporates and private household clients totalled DKK 852 million as at the end of 2015.

Strategy & core business areas Since Jyske Bank achieved national coverage in the 1980s, the Jyske Bank Group

<<<

's strategy has been to focus its business activities primarily on Danish SME and retail clients, via the retail and commercial banking activities and the strong Danish branch network, with selected niche activities outside of Denmark in private

<<<

 banking via foreign subsidiaries. Over the last few decades the Jyske Bank Group has also built up considerable trading and investment activities based on client transactions and asset management via the division Jyske Markets, also servicing

<<<

 larger institutional and corporate clients. Finally, following the merger with BRFkredit at the end of April 2014, the Jyske Bank Group achieved significant activities in Danish mortgage lending and became a significant player in the Danish

<<<

 financial sector.
Overall the Jyske Bank Group's business model and strategy build on rendering advice and delivering financial services that are simple, forward-looking and responsible to private individuals, businesses and institutions.
The

<<<

 Jyske Bank Group offers financial products and other related products and services primarily in Denmark. The Jyske Bank Group is a full-line supplier of financial products for all client groups and holds continued organic growth potential.

<<<


The Jyske Bank Group's business model involves strategic sourcing of partnerships in key areas, including life insurance products through PFA Pension, insurance products from GF Forsikring A/S, mortgage products within agriculture through DLR

<<<

 Kredit A/S as well as payment cards via SEB. Similarly, since 2011, the Jyske Bank Group is a member of Foreningen Bankdata, which delivers essential parts of Jyske Bank's IT development and IT solutions, and Jyske Bank's IT operations have

<<<

 been performed at JN Data A/S since 2002.The strategic initiatives in the recent years during and following the financial crisis have focused on the strengthening of the income base through selective acquisitions and cost reductions, strengthening

<<<

 of the capital base via capital increases in 2009 and 2012 and divesture of non-core activities.
Following the merger with BRFkredit in 2014, there is and will continue to be a strong strategic focus in the Jyske Bank Group on the financing

<<<

 of real property. Through the two-brand strategy, enhanced distribution strength and an extended client base, active efforts are made to gain even more full-service clients for the Jyske Bank Group. The new "Jyske home loan products" are, together

<<<

 with BRFkredits' direct mortgage activities, key drivers of the Jyske Bank Group's future growth and strengthening of the Jyske Bank Group's overall market position in Denmark during a period of time when the general demand for bank loans is

<<<

 still weak. The overall strategic vision of the Jyske Bank Group is to become "the preferred bank for the Danish homeowner". The aimed synergies related to the merger with BRFkredit of DKK 600 mio. per year were realised at the end of the first

<<<

 half of 2016. The Jyske Bank Group will keep continued strategic focus on cost reductions through the optimisation of IT, business processes and overlapping functions.
As of end of June 2016, the volume of the new Jyske home loans initially

<<<

 launched in December 2013 amounted to DKK 68bn. BRKkredit has also experienced increasing activities during first half of 2016 which supports the Jyske Bank Group's expectations of growth in housing-related loans by DKK 18bn-20bn in 2016. The

<<<

 objective is to increase the Jyske Bank Group's housing-related loans by DKK 100bn. In respect of corporate clients, the objective is that the Jyske Bank Group will see a growth in mortgage loans in the amount of DKK 20bn over a 5-year period

<<<

.
Banking activities
Jyske Bank's retail and commercial banking activities in Denmark focus primarily on Danish individuals, families, SMEs, as well as local and regional public institutions and state institutions. Customers are serviced
62

<<<



via the nationwide branch network and via the Internet and mobile phone banking platforms. Jyske Bank offers a full range of financial services in connection with financial solutions, including leasing, financing and mortgage lending activities

<<<

, partly via its own subsidiaries (Jyske Finans A/S and BRFkredit) or via sourcing agreements with external strategic partners.
Trading and investment activities incl. of asset management and international private banking
Investment advice and

<<<

 asset management services, including trading in fixed-income products, foreign currency, bonds, shares, commodities and derivatives based on client transactions and aimed at national and international investors, partly through the activities

<<<

 in Jyske Markets in DK-Silkeborg, and partly through the Private Banking entities in Gibraltar and Copenhagen.
BRFkredit mortgage lending activities
Mortgage lending activities, specialising in owner-occupied homes, vacation homes, commercial

<<<

 properties, subsidised housing and joint funding. Mortgage products are distributed via Jyske Bank's retail branches, partners, an online web-platform and a mobile sales force.
Jyske Bank Group Risk Management The Jyske Bank Group assumes financial

<<<

 risks within established limits and to the extent the risk-adjusted return contributes to the Jyske Bank Group's financial goal, but to the greatest possible extent the Jyske Bank Group attempts to minimise financial risks considering the related

<<<

 costs. Risk management is a key element in the Jyske Bank Group's daily operations and is anchored in the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board and the Jyske Bank Group Executive Board. The total risks are always adjusted to the Jyske Bank Group

<<<

's risk profile and capital structure according to the Jyske Bank Group's capital management objective.
The largest financial risks related to the Jyske Bank Group's operations are credit risks which mainly arise from credit granting, market

<<<

 risks predominantly in the form of interest-rate risk and finally liquidity risk which arises as an integrated part of the banking activities, and the role of maturity transformation. In addition to these risks, the Jyske Bank Group's activities

<<<

 also involve counterparty risk related to trading of derivatives and operational and business risks driven by the general activities and operations of the Jyske Bank Group.
Risk Management organisation The Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board

<<<

 lays down the general principles for risk and capital management as well as for the Jyske Bank Group's risk profile, and implements these in the Jyske Bank Group by adopting a number of risk policies and instructions. Together with the Jyske

<<<

 Bank Group Executive Board, the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board is responsible for ensuring that the Jyske Bank Group has an organisational structure that will secure a distinct allocation of responsibility and include an appropriate separation

<<<

 of functions between development units, operating units and control units in the daily monitoring and management of the Jyske Bank Group's risks.
The Jyske Bank Group Executive Board is responsible for the day-to-day risk management and the

<<<

 management of the Jyske Bank Group and will ensure that policies and instructions are operationalised and complied with. The Jyske Bank Group Executive Board has appointed a group chief risk officer, who is the director of the Finance and Risk

<<<

 Management Unit. The responsibilities of the unit include activities involving risks across areas of risk and organisational units.
To achieve efficient risk management close to the mortgage-credit business, the Jyske Bank Group has appointed

<<<

 a risk officer at BRFkredit. The risk officer and his employees form an integral part of the unit Finance and Risk Management to ensure that the group chief risk officer has a complete overview of the entire Jyske Bank Group's risks. The organisational

<<<

 structure of the Jyske Bank Group, ensures that the unit "Finance and Risk Management" is separated from the risk-taking units and remains independent of business-oriented activities.
63

Risk management organisation
Risk committees Several

<<<

 committees consider and process risk-related issues. Members of the Jyske Bank Group Audit Committee are appointed from the members of the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board. The committee checks whether the Jyske Bank Group's internal management

<<<

 and risk management systems function effectively. These tasks are carried out, amongst other things, through written and oral reporting to the committee as well as the committee's consideration of the relevant audit reports. The Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group Risk Committee is a Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board committee that carries out the preliminary consideration of risk-related issues before the final consideration by the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board at quarterly meetings. The

<<<

 main task of the monthly Jyske Bank Group Treasury Committee is to ensure that the Jyske Bank Group's actual market risk profile is in line with the assessment of market expectations and the intended risk profile. The Jyske Bank Group's liquidity

<<<

 risk profile, balancesheet development and financial structure are assessed by the Jyske Bank Group Balance Sheet Committee, which at its quarterly meetings ensures a continuously adequate liquidity-risk profile and balance-sheet structure

<<<

 according to the general guidelines. Credit Risk Management Both Jyske Bank and BRFkredit are approved by the Danish FSA as advanced financial institutions under CRD IV and use Advanced Internal Ratings Based ("AIRB") models for the calculation

<<<

 of the capital base requirements for credit risk. Credit policy and responsibility Jyske Bank's Group Supervisory Board lays down the overall guidelines for credit granting within the Jyske Bank Group, and the largest exposures are presented

<<<

 to the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board for approval. The Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board delegates limits to the members of the Jyske Bank Group Executive Board. Credit risk is managed through Jyske Bank's credit policy, of which the

<<<

 objective is to keep the Jyske Bank Group credit risk at an acceptable level in relation to the capital base and business volume o f the Jyske Bank Group, given the general trend in the Danish economy. Client transactions with the Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group must generate a satisfactory long-term return according to other Risk Adjustment Return on Capital ("RAROC") principles. Specific credit policies have been formulated for all areas in which the Jyske Bank Group assumes credit risk, and

<<<

 credit risk levels and undesirable types o f business have been identified. The policies are regularly adjusted to meet current requirements and adapted to the management tools available to account

managers and the monitoring functions

<<<

. Credit risk is managed on the basis of the Jyske Bank Group's credit risk models. Limits and authorisation Jyske Bank has a decentralised credit-authorisation process with a limit structure in line with the below hierarchy. For each level

<<<

 it is clearly stated which amounts, instances and segments are covered by the limit.
Day-to-day management of credit risk is undertaken by account managers as well as the Credit Division with due regard to credit policies and credit instructions

<<<

. Limits are delegated to account managers individually on the basis of perceived competence and need. Decisions about applications over and above the limits delegated to account managers are made by the Credit Division. Credit-related decisions

<<<

 relating to the Credit Division's limits are made by the Jyske Bank Group Executive Board for credit cases at Jyske Bank A/S, whereas the Supervisory Boards for the individual subsidiaries authorise cases involving clients of the subsidiaries

<<<

. The credit process and monitoring The basis of each authorisation of credit is the client's ability to repay the loan. A central element in the assessment of the creditworthiness of corporate clients is their ability to service debt out of

<<<

 cash flows from operations in combination with their financial strength. In respect of personal clients, their debt servicing ability, as reflected in budgets and disposable income (before and after the raising of the loan), is decisive. The

<<<

 extent of data and analyses depend on the client's financial situation and the complexity of the case and may therefore vary from case to case. All the Jyske Bank Group's credit risk positions are monitored by two departments, Risk Management

<<<

 and Risk as well as Credit Risk Supervision. Both departments are separate from client-oriented functions. The exposure of the Jyske Bank Group by size, sector and geographical area is monitored and analysed on an on going basis with a view

<<<

 to reducing the risk associated with specific high-risk sectors and geographical areas and ensuring satisfactory diversification of the portfolio. Monitoring is executed by means of quantitative models at portfolio level - the credit quality

<<<

 of each branch is monitored, and selected large commitments are reviewed. Moreover, risk monitoring includes qualitative as well as quantitative control of data used in risk and RAROC calculations. The Jyske Bank Group's internal credit ratings

<<<

 and the mapped BRFkredit ratings aim to assess the credit risk in a one-year perspective, while external ratings (Aaa - C) aim to assess the credit risk in a longer perspective. If the credit rating calculated by the model is considered to

<<<

 be inadequate, independent credit experts may review the credit rating of corporate clients at the request of the relevant account manager.
65

Credit exposure Credit exposures are quantified by means of exposure at default ("EAD"). EAD reflects

<<<

 the exposure at default in the event of the client defaulting in the course of the next twelve months. A client's overall EAD depends on client-specific factors and the specific products held by the client. For most product types, EAD is calculated

<<<

 on the basis of statistical models, while a few product types are based on expert models.
Collateral The provision of collateral is a material element in credit granting in order to limit credit risk and minimise the Jyske Bank Group's future

<<<

 losses. The need to demand collateral will be considered for each exposure on its merits, but as a main rule, clients are required to provide full or partial collateral for their exposures. The Jyske Bank Group's mortgage loans are always secured

<<<

 by mortgages on immovable property, and also in a large number of cases, guarantees are provided by third parties in connection with cooperation with other financial institutions. Collateral received is a main element of the Jyske Bank Group

<<<

's assessment of Loss Given Default ("LGD"). LGD is the part of the Jyske Bank Group's total exposure to a client which the Jyske Bank Group expects to lose in the event o f the client defaulting within the next twelve months. A client's LGD

<<<

 depends on specific factors concerning the client, but also on the commitment and the collateral provided. Overall, LGD also depends on Jyske Bank's ability to collect receivables and liquidate collateral.
Market risk management The Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group uses the standardised approach for calculation of the capital base requirements for market risk under the CRD IV.
Market risk is the risk that the Jyske Bank Group will incur losses arising from position-taking in the financial markets

<<<

 or from the general banking and mortgage banking operations. The dominant market risk component is interest rate risk, caused by changes in market interest rates. In addition, the Jyske Bank Group also faces exchange rate risk, equity risk

<<<

 and commodity risk caused by changes in exchange rates, equity prices or commodity prices as well as volatility risk caused by changes in volatility levels. Every risk type has its own characteristics and is managed by means of individual risk

<<<

 measurements as well as through the Jyske Bank Group's Value-at-Risk model and supplemented by risk measurements developed in accordance with conventional option theory, i.e. by calculating the delta, gamma and vega risks of the positions.

<<<


Jyske Bank has three business areas that manage and are allowed to assume significant market risk. Strategic market risks are managed by Jyske Bank Group Treasury, and investments are in general based on macroeconomic principles and thus of

<<<

 a long-term nature. Jyske Markets and BRFkredit manage short-term market risks as part of the servicing of clients daily trade volume with financial instruments and as part of clients' repayment and raising of mortgage loans. The Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group Supervisory Board lays down the market risk policy and relevant guidelines stating the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board's risk profile for the area of market risk. The policy is specified in a number of limits delegated to the Jyske

<<<

 Bank Group Executive Board. The limits are further limited before being delegated to the three heads of Jyske Markets, Jyske Bank Group Treasury and BRFkredit, respectively. Operations in accordance with the respective limits are supported

<<<

 by detailed procedures. The Jyske Bank Group Treasury Committee follows market developments closely and is therefore able to adjust for any discrepancies between the Jyske Bank Group's actual risk profile and its desired risk profile.
All risk

<<<

 positions are monitored daily. The Jyske Bank Group Executive Board is notified immediately o f any positions which exceed the pre-determined limits or are in conflict with the risk management policy. The Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board

<<<

 and Internal Audit are notified immediately if positions exceed the overall authority of the Jyske Bank Group Executive Board. The development of the market risk exposure of the various units is reported monthly to the Jyske Bank Group Executive

<<<

 Board and the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board. Monitoring and reporting of market risk take place through a risk-management system which is developed by Jyske Bank and integrated with Jyske Bank's trading systems as well as other systems

<<<

 for the handling of Jyske Bank's regular banking and mortgage operations.
66

Operational Risk Management The Jyske Bank Group uses the standardised approach for calculation of the capital base requirements for operational risk under the CRD

<<<

 IV.
Operational risk relates to all internal processes such as the risk of Jyske Bank being exposed to potential losses as a result of inexpedient processes, human errors, IT errors as well as fraud. Operational risk can therefore not be eliminated

<<<

, yet attempts are made to minimise this risk. The Jyske Bank Group monitors and actively manages operational risk to reduce the risk of operational events resulting in material loss and damage to reputation. Jyske Bank's Group Supervisory Board

<<<

 sets out a policy for operational risk, which states the framework for identification, assessment, monitoring and management of the operational risk as well as the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board's risk profile for the area. The purpose

<<<

 of the policy is to keep operational risks at an acceptable level in respect of the Jyske Bank Group's overall objectives and the cost associated with reducing the risks.
Developments in operational risk are monitored to ensure the best possible

<<<

 basis for risk management. Monitoring is based on continuous dialogue with management to ensure that all the material operational risks of the Jyske Bank Group are reflected in the risk scenarios. Risk scenarios, risk exposure and control environment

<<<

 are evaluated annually in cooperation with the business units.
The Jyske Bank Group Executive Board and the relevant business unit directors are in charge of operational risk management. This management is an integral part of daily operations

<<<

 through policies and controls established with the object of securing the best possible processing environment. On the basis of scenario analyses and regular reporting of the Jyske Bank Group's operational risks, management considers the Jyske

<<<

 Bank Group's risk exposure on an ongoing basis and decides whether to introduce initiatives to reduce operational risks. Every year the Jyske Bank Group Executive Board and the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board receive a comprehensive report

<<<

 that describes the development of the Jyske Bank Group's operational risks accompanied by error statistics from the error registry. If the Jyske Bank Group's operational risks change materially, this is reported immediately to the Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group Executive Board. Transgressions of defined risk targets are also reported to the Jyske Bank Group Executive Board and the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board.
Liquidity Risk Management & Funding Structure Liquidity risk occurs due to funding

<<<

 mismatch in the balance sheet. The Jyske Bank Group's liquidity risk can primarily be attributed to its bank lending activities as the Jyske Bank Group's bank loan portfolio has a longer contractual duration than its average funding sources

<<<

. The liquidity risk at BRFkredit is very limited as the liquidity flow at BRFkredit takes place predominantly in a closed circuit linked to the balance principle and the statutory protection of SDOs.
Objective and overall setup The Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group Supervisory Board determines the liquidity profile expressed as the balance between the risk level and the Jyske Bank Group's costs of managing liquidity risk. The risk levels are re-assessed on an on-going basis in consideration of the

<<<

 current market-related and economic conditions in Denmark and the financial sector. The overall development in lending and deposits in the Danish banking sector, the rating agencies' assessment of the Jyske Bank Group's liquidity and funding

<<<

 risks as well as changes in statutory requirements will of course cause a reassessment of which risk levels can be deemed satisfactory.
Jyske Bank's liquidity management must ensure adequate short and long-term liquidity so the Jyske Bank Group

<<<

 can in due time honour its payment obligations by having reasonable funding costs. This is ensured through the following sub-objectives and policies:
1. a strong and stable deposit basis which ensures stable long-term funding of the Jyske Bank

<<<

 Group's lending activities;
2. continued high credit ratings by international rating agencies; 67

3. active participation in the international money markets and permanent access to international capital markets through capital market programmes

<<<

 which give access to a diversified and professional funding base; and
4. maintenance of a considerable buffer of highly liquid securities reflecting the run-off risk of more volatile price and credit sensitive funding sources. The liquidity

<<<

 buffer ensures that Jyske Bank can eliminate the effect of an adverse liquidity situation.
Management and monitoring The Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board has adopted a liquidity policy which, among other things, defines a specific critical

<<<

 survival horizon for the Jyske Bank Group during an adverse stress scenario to ensure that the Jyske Bank Group can at all times meet its obligations and pursue its operations for a specific time horizon, in case a crisis occurs during which

<<<

 the Jyske Bank Group is unable to use a substantial part of its normal funding sources. On the basis of the general limits, the Jyske Bank Group Executive Board has defined specific operational limits and policies for Jyske Bank Group Treasury

<<<

, Jyske Markets and BRFkredit. Jyske Markets and BRFkredit manage the short term operational liquidity flows, within the defined operational limits, whereas Jyske Bank Group Treasury monitors and manages the strategic liquidity risk in accordance

<<<

 with the limits and liquidity policies adopted. The effect on liquidity from the limited amount of `free' liquidity flows at BRFkredit is included in the group internal control at Jyske Bank Group Treasury.
Strategic liquidity management Strategic

<<<

 liquidity management in the Jyske Bank Group Treasury is based on measurement of the Jyske Bank Group's liquidity position in various stress scenarios. The asset side of the liquidity balance is broken down and grouped in order of liquidity

<<<

, whereas the financial liabilities side is grouped according to expected contractual or assumed behavioural run-off risk in various scenarios, and the liquidity buffer is used to cover negative payment gaps in the scenarios. Jyske Bank Group

<<<

 Treasury is responsible for ensuring that the Jyske Bank Group holds a liquidity buffer sufficient to ensure that the Jyske Bank Group can at all times withstand the assumed run-off of the credit sensitive funding sources and be able to meet

<<<

 the critical survival horizons in the three scenarios used in strategic management. All scenarios assume, as a minimum failure, to obtain refinancing in the capital markets through inter-bank loans, commercial paper ("CP") and euro medium term

<<<

 note ("EMTN") issues (senior issues as well as senior secured).
Scenario 1 is a severe Jyske Bank Group-specific stress scenario which is monitored daily and is included as the key ratio in the limit structure of delegated authority with a

<<<

 short critical survival horizon of 60 days: the Jyske Bank Group must be able to withstand run-off of all large demand and term deposits from the corporate and retail client segments in addition to being cut-off from refinancing in the capital

<<<

 markets.
Scenario 2 is a broad general capital and money-market sector crisis stress scenario which is monitored on a regular basis as part of the internal liquidity management with a target survival horizon of six months: in addition to not

<<<

 being able to re-finance on the capital markets, the Jyske Bank Group must be able to withstand drawdowns by large corporate customers of unutilised lines and commitments, while at the same time facing stagnation in deposit growth.
Scenario

<<<

 3 is a pure "no access to capital markets funding" stress scenario which is monitored on a regular basis as part of the internal liquidity management and has a survival horizon of at least one year. Currently based on the state of the Danish

<<<

 economy, an unchanged volume of deposits as well as loans and advances is presumed.
Liquidity contingency plan The liquidity contingency plan comes into force if the Jyske Bank Group can only meet the internally delegated limits at very high

<<<

 costs or is ultimately unable to do so within the critical horizons. The
68

contingency plan stipulates a detailed set of management reports, and it determines a broad range of initiatives that can be used to strengthen the Jyske Bank Group

<<<

's liquidity position.
The Jyske Bank Group's liquidity buffer Jyske Bank Group's liquidity buffer consists solely of assets which are not pledged or used as collateral in the day-to-day operations of the Jyske Bank Group, but can be sold immediately

<<<

 or pledged or used as collateral for loans and thereby represent a swift and efficient source of liquidity. The measurement of the Jyske Bank Group's liquidity buffer takes into account haircuts of the relevant assets. The Jyske Bank Group

<<<

's holding of securities is divided into three groups in order of liquidity: 1) ultra-liquid assets denominated in DKK, which can be used in repo transactions with the Danish central bank; 2) very liquid assets denominated in EUR, which can

<<<

 be used in repo transactions with the European Central Bank; 3) assets on which loans cannot be raised with central banks.
Jyske Bank Group has adopted a general policy for the size and quality of its liquidity buffer, which is adjusted to

<<<

 suit the Jyske Bank Group's balance sheet composition and risk profile. In practice, the liquidity buffer policy implies that the liquidity buffer consists predominantly of assets from liquidity groups 1 and 2. It is thus Jyske Bank Group's

<<<

 policy that it must be able to meet the limit of the survival horizon of stress scenario 1 merely by freeing assets from liquidity groups 1 and 2.
Funding and balance sheet structure From the perspective of liquidity risk, Jyske Bank Group

<<<

.

69

The Jyske Bank Group's net holdings of securities3 are currently primarily funded through the deposit surplus and also though the issue of bonds under capital market programmes. The responsibility for issuing bonds in the capital markets

<<<

 (senior debt as well as the capital base) is centralised in Jyske Bank Group Treasury, which can then, when necessary, distribute liquidity or capital to BRFkredit. To manage the long term strategic liquidity risk profile, a CP and an EMTN

<<<

 programme are utilised to ensure maximum flexibility with regard to maturity, currency, interest rate (fixed/floating) and investor base.
The French-regulated CP programme (limit EUR5 billion) ensures diversification and depth in the Jyske

<<<

 Bank Group's short-term and medium-term liquidity management so as to comply with the limit structure of the Jyske Bank Group. Funding under the programme may have a term of up to one year, but will typically have a term of 3 months. Jyske

<<<

 Bank has established strong investor recognition of the Jyske Bank Group's CP programme both in and outside France, and as end of June 2016 the outstanding volume under the programme was DKK 22.7 billion (EUR 3.1 billion).
For long-term funding

<<<

 in the international capital markets, Jyske Bank uses an EMTN Programme to issue Notes with a typical maturity of between two and ten years. The primary investor segment for the Notes is well diversified throughout Europe, and it is a cornerstone

<<<

 in the Jyske Bank Group's risk management policy to maintain on-going activities in the market for public benchmark issues by issuing at least one annual benchmark bond (EUR 500 million) each year in addition to selected activities in "private

<<<

 placements". The distribution of the Bank's last three benchmark bond issues show that the Bank has built up strong access to the European investor base, with 81 per cent., 92 per cent. and 74 per cent. of the bonds placed outside Denmark in

<<<

 the benchmark transactions in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, ensuring diversification in the funding structure. At the end of June 2016, senior bond issues under the programme amounted to DKK 19.1 billion (EUR 2.6 billion)
A part of the

<<<

 net Jyske Bank Group holdings of securities is a function of Jyske Market's activities in the interbank and wholesale fixed-term market carried out as part of the short-term operational liquidity management in the Jyske Bank Group. In addition

<<<

, Jyske Markets funds its own wholesale-related activities by taking up unsecured loans in the wholesale fixed-term and inter-bank markets. Jyske Markets is active in the international money markets as a trader in all major currencies and related

<<<

 derivatives and as a marketmaker in the Nordic inter-bank money markets. Continuous activity in the above-mentioned markets is paramount to ensure on-going access to refinancing short-term positions and a natural part of the business of Jyske

<<<

 Markets.
New liquidity risk legislation The liquidity coverage requirement ("LCR") came into force on 1 October 2015. The LCR is a short-term (30 days) idiosyncratic stress scenario. The critical survival horizon for the Jyske Bank Group's

<<<

 stress scenario 1 has been the anchor in the Jyske Bank Group's limit structure on a daily basis since 2007. In the wake of the implementation of the LCR as a statutory requirement, the plan is that stress scenario 1 will remain a part of overall

<<<

 liquidity risk management. However the key short-term limit on stress scenario 1 is to be replaced by an adjusted version of the LCR on a daily basis with the aim of achieving clarity in the monitoring and in the limits set. Being a Danish

<<<

 SIFI, the Jyske Bank Group was required to be 100 per cent. compliant with the LCR requirement from 1 October 2015. The LCR requires that at least 30 per cent. of the total liquid LCR reserves must be government bonds. The remaining part of

<<<

 the LCR reserve (max. 70 per cent.) may consist of mortgage bonds, of which the most liquid ones in 'Level 1b' are included with a haircut of 7 per cent.. In the course of 2015, Jyske Bank as well as BRFkredit gradually recalibrated the liquidity

<<<

 buffer (increased the holding of Level 1a assets), adjusted repo positions, and enhanced the core liquidity position to ensure compliance with the LCR. At end of December 2015, the LCR was 174 per cent. and end
In the above illustration, repo

<<<

 holdings have been netted, i.e. repo has been deducted and repo reverse added and adjustments have been made for loans with central banks.
70

of June 2016 the LCR was 357 per cent. At the end of the first half of 2016, the LCR level was extraordinarily

<<<

 high due to the markedly lower net outflow, but at a normal level for the outflow, it would still be substantially above the internal objective. Currently, the Jyske Bank Group's internal objective is a minimum target for the LCR of 150 per

<<<

 cent., with some flexibility regarding the actual composition of the buffer. The primary focus in the management of the Jyske Bank Group's LCR buffer is on the total amount of LCR eligible Level 1 and Level 2 assets. The split between Level

<<<

 1a and other eligible LCR assets is of secondary importance. Capital Management & capital ratios The objective of capital management is to optimise the Jyske Bank Group's capital structure given the adopted risk profile, and to maintain a solvency

<<<

 ratio sufficient for the Jyske Bank Group to continue its lending activities during a period of difficult business conditions. The capital adequacy is assessed on the basis of both internal and statutory capital base requirements. The Group

<<<

 must fulfil the minimum regulatory capital base requirements which are set according to the risk types of credit, market and operational risk. Furthermore the Group must fulfil the individual solvency requirement, the "Pillar II" requirement

<<<

. The Pillar II requirement for the Group is determined as the higher of the requirements based on the Group's internally calculated adequate capital base (according to the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP")) and the adequate

<<<

 capital base according to the Danish FSA's 8+ method as well as statutory limits. At end June 2016, the Group determined an individual solvency requirement of 10.3 per cent., representing a Pillar II requirement of 2.3 per cent. (10.3 per cent

<<<

. - 8 per cent. minimum Pillar I requirement) equalling the solvency requirement according to the method of internal calculation (ICAAP), 0.60 per cent. add on from the gradual phasing in of the institution specific SIFI buffer and 0.6 per cent

<<<

. add on of the capital conservation buffer. Capital management objectives and capital structure From 1 January 2014, the Group must comply with the capital requirement regulations, CRR, and CRD IV, which phase in tighter capital base requirements

<<<

 over the coming years. Jyske Bank Group is designated as a Danish SIFI, which entails the gradual phasing in of a 1.5 per cent. SIFI supplement to the capital base requirement that reflects the Jyske Bank Group's systemic importance. The below

<<<

 graph illustrates an estimate of the fully loaded CRD IV and SIFI requirements by 2019 (total capital ratio as well as CET1 requirements) assuming both a 2.5 per cent. capital conservation buffer as well as a 2.5 per cent. countercyclical buffer

<<<

, and a Pillar II of 2.3 per cent. (in line with the requirement as of end June 20164) compared to the current capital levels as at end of June 2016. The Danish Ministry of Business & Growth has set the countercyclical capital buffer at 0 per

<<<

 cent. for 2015 and 2016.
Pillar II is not statutory but institution specific. It is dynamic and must be calculated and published on a quarterly basis. The Group has estimated that the requirement will be in the range of 1.5 per cent. to 3

5 per cent. over the coming years.

 issued the first subordinated debt in 10 years - a Tier 2 of SEK 1bn (10NC5).
In June 2016 the Jyske Bank Group announced an additional share buy-back programme of DKK 500m to be executed from 1 July 2016 until end of December 2016. This share

 buy-back programme was subsequently increased to DKK 1bn at the announcement of the Jyske Bank Group's half year results on 18 August 2016.
The Jyske Bank Group has no pre-set payout ratio. The Jyske Bank Group will pay out amounts not needed

 to sustain business strategy and growth, taking into consideration potential negative capital effects from new or proposed regulation such as Basel IV, and the Jyske Bank Group's rating. Maintenance of a "strong" S&P RAC ratio remains a cornerstone

.
Basel IV's proposed new Advanced Internal Rating Based ("AIRB") method and the proposed new standardised floors for credit risk may, based on the Jyske Bank Group's preliminary estimates from June 2016 of the most recent Basel Committee drafts

<<<

 from Spring 2016, have a negative effect of around 4 per cent. of the Jyske Bank Group's capital ratios. Based on management's earnings objectives of an after tax RoE of 8-12 per cent. for the years up to the planned implementation of Basel

<<<

 IV by 2020, positive net consolidation is expected to ensure the necessary capital buffer to absorb the potential future negative effects of the new AIRB and standardised floors. Furthermore, the Jyske Bank Group expects that a substantial

 part of the estimated AT1 and AT2 issuance of 3.5 per cent. of REA will be accomplished by the end of 2017.
As of the end of June 2016, Available Distributable Items ("ADI") of Jyske Bank A/S represent DKK 26,950 mio. out of total equity of

Leverage ratio The CRR introduces the leverage ratio, which is a risk-neutral measure for the maximum extent of the balance-sheet leverage (see "Legislative and Regulatory Review"). The Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board has

<<<

 adopted a policy for maximum leverage, splitting the Jyske Bank Group's balance sheet into two sub portfolios as it is assessed that the Jyske Bank Group's banking and mortgage activities have different adequate leverage levels. The banking

<<<

 activities of the Jyske Bank Group involve a higher risk in respect of liquidity and capital than do the Jyske Bank Group's mortgage activities, and therefore a higher acceptable leverage is applied to the mortgage activities than to the banking

<<<

 activities. Jyske Bank monitors the leverage with a view to avoiding excessive leverage risk. The development of the leverage ratio is determined monthly and any adjusting actions are discussed with due regard to the Jyske Bank Group's strategy

<<<

 and capital structure. The development of the levels of leverage in the Jyske Bank Group is reported on a quarterly basis to the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board and the Jyske Bank Group Risk Committee.

 ratio for the Jyske Bank Group was 5.1 per cent. The calculation of the leverage ratio was made according to current guidelines in the CRR at the end of 2015 and was based on endof-year figures.
Jyske Bank Group recovery plan
The BRRD requires

<<<

 banks to draw up recovery plans which should be used in the unlikely event that the bank encounters serious financial trouble. Jyske Bank submitted its recovery plan to the Danish FSA in the summer of 2015. In spring 2016, the Danish FSA confirmed

<<<

 Jyske Bank's recovery plan, which is designed to facilitate the continuity of the Jyske Bank Group's critical business processes in the event of significant financial stress. The recovery plan contains a number of recovery options that can

<<<

 be undertaken. These have been tested against different stress scenarios to ensure that the Jyske Bank Group is able to recover under different circumstances.
The recovery plan includes recovery indicators, which are quantitative and qualitative

<<<

 indicators that monitor the development in capital, liquidity, profitability and asset quality of the Jyske Bank Group and in relevant macro-economic and market-based indicators. The indicators serve as potential warnings to allow early identification

<<<

 of adverse developments in the Jyske Bank Group. As an integrated part of risk management of the Jyske Bank Group, the indicators are monitored and reported quarterly to the Jyske Bank Group Supervisory Board, the Jyske Bank Group Executive

<<<

 Board and the Jyske Bank Group Risk Committee, who will consider and act upon adverse developments.
The recovery plan contains a detailed mapping o f business lines, departments and functions within the Jyske Bank Group which enables the Danish

<<<

 FSA to get a complete picture of all the activities within Jyske Bank.
Jyske Bank Group Credit ratings Since the start of the economic downturn in 2009, bank ratings, and thus also the ratings of Jyske Bank, have been under pressure. Jyske

<<<

 Bank's credit ratings are material to the price o f funding and capital as well as to the funding flexibility in the form o f access to a broad investor base for both longer dated senior unsecured funding, the issuance of short dated commercial

<<<

 paper and the access to subordinated capital. It is therefore a high priority o f the Jyske Bank Group that its issuer credit rating is on a high and competitive level.
The Jyske Bank Group is rated by S&P. In July 2015, S&P rated a number

<<<

 of Danish financial institutions following the implementation of the BRRD in Denmark which took effect on 1 June 2015. Jyske Bank's stand alone credit profile - the SACP - was upgraded from BBB+ to A- based on a more robust capital and risk

<<<

 position ("RAC"). The strengthened RAC offset the removal of the one notch of government support previously incorporated in the long term senior rating of Jyske Bank, and Jyske Bank's S&P senior rating has thus remained unchanged at A-/A-2

<<<

 with a "stable outlook" throughout 2015 and 2016 thus far. As a key subsidiary, BRFkredit inherits Jyske Bank's rating. The SACP upgrade improved the rating of subordinated Tier 2 ("AT2") capital by one notch from BBB- to BBB as the AT2 rating

<<<

 is notched two notches down from the SACP.
S&P's ratings on Jyske Bank and BRFkredit reflect S&P's expectation of future capital, efficiency, and assetquality gains in the Jyske Bank Group as the Danish economy continues to improve. The stable

<<<

 outlook reflects S&P's view that the Jyske Bank Group will maintain a RAC ratio sustainably above 10 per cent. (10.6 per cent. as of December 2015). The stronger RAC is expected to be supported by stronger, more diversified and stable earnings

<<<

 resulting from synergies of the merger with BRFkredit in 2014, which enhanced the diversification of the Jyske Bank Group's loan portfolio. S&P expects the synergies to be driven by growth in the Jyske home loan products, cross-selling opportunities

<<<

 and improved efficiency.

Legal and arbitration proceedings
The Jyske Bank Group operates in a legal and regulatory

<<<

 environment that exposes it to potentially significant litigation and regulatory risks. As a result, the Jyske Bank Group is and may become involved in various disputes and legal proceedings in Denmark and other jurisdictions, including litigation

<<<

 and regulatory investigations. Such disputes and legal proceedings are subject to many uncertainties, and other outcomes are often difficult to predict, particularly in the earlier stages o f a case or investigation.
The Jyske Bank Group is

<<<

 a party to a number o f legal disputes arising from its business activities. Provisions for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has incurred as a result o f past events and it is probable that there will be

<<<

 an outflow o f resources that can be reliably estimated. In this case, the Jyske Bank Group arrives at an estimate on the basis o f an evaluation o f the most likely outcome. Provisions are measured at the present value o f the anticipated

<<<

 expenditure for settlement o f the legal or constructive obligation that reflects the risks specific to the obligation.
As at the date of this Prospectus there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings

<<<

 which are pending or threatened o f which the Issuer is aware) which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on the financial position or profitability of the Issuer and/or the Jyske Bank Group.

SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE

<<<


The Joint Lead Managers have, pursuant to a Subscription Agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") dated 14 September 2016, jointly and severally agreed to subscribe and pay for the Notes at the issue price of 100.00 per cent. of the principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes. The Issuer will pay a commission to the Joint Lead Managers pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. The Issuer will also reimburse the Joint Lead Managers in respect of certain of their expenses, and has agreed to indemnify

<<<

 the Joint Lead Managers against certain liabilities incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes. The Subscription Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances prior to payment to the Issuer.
United States of America: Regulation

<<<

 S Category 2; TEFRA D
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in the preceding sentence

<<<

 have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or its possessions or to U.S. persons, except in

<<<

 certain transactions permitted by U.S. Treasury regulations. Terms used in the preceding sentence have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder.
Each Joint Lead Manager

<<<

 has agreed that, except as permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering

<<<

 and the Issue Date (the "distribution compliance period") within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons and that it will have sent to each distributor, dealer or person to which it sells the Notes during the

<<<

 distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have

<<<

 the respective meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.
In addition, until forty days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes, any offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether

<<<

 or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
United Kingdom
Each Joint Lead Manager has represented and agreed that:
(a) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions

<<<

 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and
(b) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated, and will only communicate

<<<

 or cause to be communicated, any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in

<<<

 circumstances in which section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 would not, if the Issuer was not an authorised person, apply to the Issuer.
Kingdom of Denmark
Each Joint Lead Manager has represented and agreed that it has

<<<

 not offered or sold and will not offer, sell or deliver any of the Notes directly or indirectly in the Kingdom of Denmark by way of public offering, unless in compliance with the Danish Consolidation Act No. 1530 of 2 February 2015 on Trading

<<<

 in Securities as amended and Executive Orders issued thereunder and in compliance with the Executive Order No. 623 of 24 April 2015 issued pursuant to the Danish Financial Business Act.
79

General Each Joint Lead Manager has represented and

<<<

 agreed that it will (to the best of its knowledge and belief) comply with all applicable securities laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers the Notes or possesses or distributes this

<<<

 Prospectus or any advertisement or other offering material and will obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer, sale or delivery by it of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction

<<<

 to which it is subject or in which it makes such purchases, offers, sales or deliveries and neither the Issuer nor any Joint Lead Manager shall have any responsibility therefor. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Joint Lead Managers represents

<<<

 that the Notes may at any time lawfully be sold in compliance with any applicable registration or other requirements in any jurisdiction, or pursuant to any exemption available thereunder, or assumes any responsibility for facilitating such

<<<

 sale.
80

TAXATION
Persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition o f the Notes should consult their own tax advisers concerning the tax consequences in the light o f their particular situations. No representations with respect

<<<

 to the tax consequences o f any particular Noteholder are made hereby.
Kingdom of Denmark
The following is a summary description o f the taxation in Denmark o f the Notes according to the Danish tax laws in force at the date hereof and is subject

<<<

 to any changes in law and the interpretation and application thereof, which changes could be made with retroactive effect. The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description o f all the tax considerations that may be relevant

<<<

 to a decision to acquire, hold or dispose o f the Notes, and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories o f investors, some o f which (such as professional dealers in securities) may be subject to special

<<<

 rules. Potential investors are under all circumstances strongly recommended to contact their own tax adviser to clarify the individual consequences o f their investment, holding and disposal o f the Notes. The Issuer makes no representations

<<<

 regarding the tax consequences ofpurchase, holding or disposal o f the Notes.
Taxation at source
Under existing Danish tax laws, no general withholding tax or coupon tax will apply to payments of interest or principal or other amounts due on

<<<

 the Notes, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to in The Danish Corporation Tax Act (Selskabsskatteloven), Consolidated Act No. 680 of 20 May 2015, as amended from time

<<<

 to time. This will not have any impact on Noteholders who are not in a relationship whereby they control, or are controlled by, the Issuer, or where the Noteholders and the Issuer are not controlled by the same group of shareholders.
Resident

<<<

 Noteholders
Private individuals, including persons who are engaged in financial trade, companies and similar enterprises resident in Denmark for tax purposes or receiving interest on the Notes through their permanent establishment in Denmark

<<<

 are liable to pay tax on such interest.
Capital gains are taxable to individuals and corporate entities in accordance with the Danish Capital and Exchange Gains Act (Kursgevinstloven), Consolidated Act No. 1113 of 18 September 2013, as amended

<<<

 from time to time. Gains and losses on Notes held by corporate entities are generally taxed in accordance with a mark-to-market principle (lagerprincippet), i.e. on an unrealised basis.
Gains and losses on Notes issued to individuals are generally

<<<

 taxed on a realised basis. The net gains are taxed as capital income at a rate of up to 42 per cent. in 2016. However, this tax rate does not apply if the individual is engaged in financial trade and considered a professional trader. The gain

<<<

 or loss will only be included in the taxable income when the net gain or loss for the year on all debt claims, debt denominated in foreign currency and investment certificates in bond-based investment funds subject to the minimum taxation exceeds

<<<

 a total of DKK 2,000.
A variety of features regarding interest and principal may apply to the Notes. The applicable taxation of capital gains to corporate entities or individuals will depend on the features applicable to the Notes in question

<<<

.
Non-Resident Noteholders
Under existing Danish tax laws, payments of interest or principal amounts to any non-resident Noteholder are not subject to taxation in Denmark, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt

<<<

 in relation to the Issuer as referred to under "Taxation at source" above. Thus no Danish withholding tax will be payable with respect to such payments and any capital gain realised upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note will not be

<<<

 subject to taxation in Denmark, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to under "Taxation at source" above.
81

This tax treatment applies solely to Noteholders who are not

<<<

 subject to full tax liability in Denmark or included in a Danish joint taxation scheme and do not carry on business in Denmark through a permanent establishment.
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Withholding
Pursuant to certain provisions

<<<

 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA, a "foreign financial institution" may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes ("foreign passthru payments") to persons that fail to meet certain certification

<<<

, reporting, or related requirements. The Issuer is a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including Denmark) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United

<<<

 States to implement FATCA ("IGAs"), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required

<<<

 to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an

<<<

 IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding

<<<

 would not apply prior to 1 January 2019. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.
The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT")
On 14 February 2013, the European

<<<

 Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States"). However

<<<

, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The

<<<

 issuance and subscription of the Notes should, however, be exempt.
Under the Commission's Proposal, FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to

<<<

 certain dealings in Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member

<<<

 State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State

<<<

.
However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate

<<<

.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

Deloitte Statsautoriseret Revisionpartnerselskab of Papirfabrikken 26, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark,

State Authorised Public Accountants

<<<

 and members of Foreningen af Statsautoriserede Revisorer, have

audited the Issuer's accounts, without qualification, in accordance with the Danish Financial Business Act

and the Jyske Bank Group's accounts, without qualification, in accordance

<<<

 with IFRS as adopted by the

EU, for each of the three financial years ended 31 December 2013, 2014 and 2015.

10. Some of the Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and

<<<

 other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Issuer or its affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. In addition, in the ordinary course of

<<<

 their business activities, the Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank

<<<

 loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or Issuer's affiliates. Certain of the Joint Lead Managers or their affiliates

<<<

 that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure

<<<

 by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices

<<<

 of the Notes. The Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients

<<<

 that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

11. The language of the Prospectus is English. Certain legislative references and technical terms have been cited in their original language in order that the
