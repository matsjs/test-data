0700313 Dannemora Magnetit AB Super Senior Secured Bond Issue due 19 February 2014

Oslo, 18 February 2014

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting regarding request for extension of maturity of the Bonds and release of funds from the Escrow Account

<<<


Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned issue (the "Bond Issue") issued by Dannemora Magnetit AB ("Dannemora" or the "Company").
Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised

<<<

 terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement constituting the Bonds dated 7 January 2014 (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this summons regarding the Company and market conditions is provided by

<<<

 the Company, and NTM expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. Introduction and Background
1.1 Executive Summary
The purpose of this summons is to seek the consent of Bondholders to proposals to (a) extend

<<<

 the maturity of Bonds and (b) release the funds remaining in the Escrow Account, notwithstanding the subsistence of certain Events of Default and of Drawdown Block Events.
1.2 Operational Update
This year has started slightly stronger than

<<<

 planned both in production and in the market. The company is running slightly positive on EBITDA. Mass recovery is still stable just above 40% and throughput on planned level. In total this means production of finished products is 2-3% above

<<<

 planned level. Market is still strong and demand is higher than ability to produce. Entire 2014 volume is covered in offtake agreements. Enquiries from new blast furnaces and new customers are coming in. Some will be followed up for potential

<<<

 of expanded fine volumes after investment installations. It is also an opportunity to increase the average price in relation to reference price by optimizing customer mix.

As previously communicated, management considers that operations are approaching the full potential of the current facility and significant

<<<

 new investments are needed to improve the recovery rate and output of finished products. In the absence of such investments, it is unlikely that the company will be able to operate profitably on a sustainable basis.
1.3 Extension to the Maturity

<<<

 Date of the Bonds
The Company and its Group have for some time been affected by a liquidity shortfall. The Company issued the Bonds in January 2014 in order to provide it with short-term bridge financing, which has enabled it to continue operations

<<<

 whilst potential solutions to its liquidity and other financial problems are being investigated.
The Company has been working since mid-2013 with various advisers (Swedbank First Securities as the Company's financial adviser, Recore AS as its

<<<

 Chief Restructuring Officer, Roschier Advokatbyrå AB as its legal adviser and Graneli to assist with financial topics, primarily modelling) to assess its financial and legal position and evaluate potential restructuring and refinancing options

<<<

 with a view to addressing its current financial difficulties for the benefit of its stakeholders as a whole (the implementation of any such option being a "Restructuring").
Although the Company and its advisers made some progress towards agreeing

<<<

 a Restructuring with the relevant stakeholders and potential investor, to date, they have been unable to secure sufficient financial commitments from the relevant parties to support a viable Restructuring. However, discussions between the Company

<<<

 and its various stakeholders and potential investors are continuing, with a view to agreeing on the terms of a Restructuring and to implement it as soon as possible.
The Company and its stakeholders will not be able to agree and implement the

<<<

 Restructuring before the Bonds mature on 19 February 2014. Under current financial conditions, the Company will not be able to repay the Bonds on their maturity date.
In order to allow discussions regarding a potential Restructuring to continue

<<<

 for a short period following the currently envisaged maturity date of the Bonds, the Company wishes to extend that maturity date, from 19 February 2014 to 28 February 2014 (the "Maturity Date Extension") and to empower NTM to agree (on behalf

<<<

 of the Bondholders) to implement further extensions to the maturity date at its reasonably discretion (in consultation with its advisers) ("NTM's Discretion to Extend").
1.4 Drawdowns from the Escrow Account
The Bond Agreement refers to a number

<<<

 of Milestone Conditions. The purpose of the Milestone Conditions was to set a timeline for achieving the key steps in the negotiation and implementation of a Restructuring. The last of the Milestone Conditions was due to be satisfied by today

<<<

's date, 17 February 2014. Except for the Milestone Condition described in sub-paragraph (b) of that definition, none of the Milestone Conditions has been satisfied by its due date.
The consequences of non-satisfaction of these Milestone Conditions

<<<

 are:

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

3 (6)

(i)

the occurrence of Events of Default pursuant to clause 18.5 of the Bond

Agreement (subject, in the case of each breach of a Milestone Condition,

to a three Business Day cure period,

<<<

 which has expired in all cases

except for Milestone Condition (c), in respect of which the cure period

will expire on 20 February 2014), all of which are still outstanding;

(ii)

NTM having become entitled, in accordance with clause 7.2

<<<

 of the Bond

Agreement, to block further drawdowns by the Company from the

Escrow Account due to the outstanding Events of Default; and

(iii)

the occurrence of a Drawdown Block Event as a result of the non

satisfaction by its due date of

<<<

 the Milestone Condition described in sub-

paragraph (c) of that definition, which also entitles NTM to block further

drawdowns from the Escrow Account.

To date, the Company has drawn an amount of SEK 10,000,000 from the Escrow Account; an

<<<

 amount of SEK 9,950,000 currently remains in the Escrow Account (the "Remaining Escrow Funds").

The Company will need to draw down the Remaining Escrow Funds in order to continue operating whilst the discussions regarding a potential Restructuring

<<<

 are continuing.

Accordingly, notwithstanding the subsistence of the outstanding Events of Default and the outstanding Drawdown Block Event, the Company wishes Bondholders to approve NTM's exercise of its discretion (in consultation with its

<<<

 advisers) to release the Remaining Escrow Funds to the Company (subject to satisfaction of the remaining Drawdown Conditions described in clause 7.2 of the Bond Agreement) (the "Release of the Remaining Escrow Funds").

1.5 Request for approval

<<<



The Company hereby requests that the Bondholders approve:

(i) the Maturity Date Extension;

(ii) NTM's Discretion to Extend; and

(iii) the Release of the Remaining Escrow Funds

(together, the "Approvals").

1.6 Reservation of Rights

All

<<<

 rights and remedies of NTM and the Bondholders that they may have now or in the future against the Company or any other member of the Group (and each of their directors) in relation to any circumstances or matter in connection with the occurrence

<<<

 of the Events of Default referred to above, whether or not subsisting at the date of this summons, are reserved. The passing of time, any action, inaction, omission, statement or discussion with, by or on the part of NTM (or the Bondholders

<<<

) should not be construed as constituting a waiver of, or as prejudicing or limiting, any of the rights

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

4 (6)

that NTM may now or hereafter have in respect of those Events of Default. Nothing in this summons

<<<

 shall be, or be deemed to be, a waiver of any breach or potential breach (present or future) of any provision of the Bond Agreement or a waiver of any obligations and/or of the rights or remedies of NTM or the Bondholders under and in connection

<<<

 with the Bond Agreement.
