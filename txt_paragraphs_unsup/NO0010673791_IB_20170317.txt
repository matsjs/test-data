.no, the Issuer hereby invites the Bondholders to offer to sell to the Issuer on the terms set out herein:

(i)

up to a maximum of 60 million Bonds in exchange of new ordinary shares in the Issuer

("New Ordinary Shares") equal to 100% of the

<<<

 face value of the Bonds based on a price

per share of 4.5 pence (the "Issue Price") and a USD:GBP exchange rate of 1.2167 (the

"Voluntary Equity Exchange"); and

(ii)

Bonds at a price of USD 1.00 for each Bond payable in cash, corresponding

<<<

 to a price equal

to 100% of the face value of the Bonds (the "Voluntary Cash Offer", and together with the

Voluntary Equity Exchange, the "Voluntary Buy-Backs").

No additional payment will be made in respect of accrued but unpaid interest

<<<

 relating to the period from and including the Interest Payment Date on 22 March 2017.

The Voluntary Buy-Backs will commence on 17 March 2017. The Voluntary Equity Exchange will expire on Friday 24 March 2017 at 13:00 CET (the "Voluntary Equity

<<<

 Exchange Deadline"), while the Voluntary Cash Offer will expire on Friday 31 March 2017 at 13:00 CET (the "Voluntary Cash Offer Deadline", and together with the Voluntary Equity Exchange Deadline, the "Voluntary Buy-Back Deadlines"). The Issuer

<<<

In the Voluntary Equity Exchange:

(i)

that the aggregate values of the New Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued to relevant

Bondholders making an offer (the "Equity Offering Bondholders") at the Issue Price will

be equal to or greater

<<<

 than USD 110,000 (calculated to be in excess of 100,000 on the basis of an agreed exchange rate of EUR 1:USD 1.0613) (the "Minimum Tendering Amount") shall be accepted by the Issuer.

(ii)

The Issuer may accept offers for Bonds from Equity

<<<

maximum USD 60 million (the "Maximum Equity Conversion Amount").

(iii)

To the extent that the aggregate face value of all the Bonds offered in the Voluntary Equity

Exchange ("Equity Offered Bonds

<<<

") is equal to or below USD 39,999,999 (the "Bond

Conversion Minimum"), the Issuer shall accept such offers in full.

(iv)

To the extent that the aggregate face value of all the Equity Offered Bonds exceeds the Bond

Conversion Minimum, the

<<<

 Issuer shall not be obliged to but may elect to accept, in part or in

full, such offers up to the Maximum Equity Conversion Amount. If the Issuer accepts such

offers in part, it will first accept Equity Offered Bonds with a face value equal

<<<

borne by the balance of the Equity Offered Bonds

<<<

 to the balance of the aggregate Equity

Offered Bonds of all Equity Offering Bondholders (in each case after deduction of the

Minimum Tendering Amount). Notwithstanding the above, in the highly unlikely event that

the Maximum Equity Conversion

<<<

 Amount is not sufficient to accept Equity Offered Bonds with

a face value equal to the Minimum Tendering Amount from all Equity Offering Bondholders,

the Issuer will select those Equity Offering Bondholders from whom it will accept Equity

<<<



Offered Bonds with a face value equal to the Minimum Tendering Amount by drawing lots

and only those selected by drawing lots and who have tendered the Minimum Tendering

Amount shall be accepted.

<<<

 extent that the aggregate face value of all the Bonds offered for purchase and

cancellation in the Voluntary Cash Offer (the "Cash Offered Bonds") by any or all of the

Bondholders (the "Cash Offering Bondholders") is equal to or below the

<<<

Cancellation Minimum (as defined below) the Issuer shall accept the Cash Offered Bonds in

full.

(ii)

To the extent that the aggregate face value of the Cash Offered Bonds exceeds the Bond

Cash Cancellation Minimum, and would

<<<

, if accepted, not require more than the total net

proceeds of the Placing and the Ancillary Subscription (both terms as defined in the

Summons) (the "Excess Cash Amount") to be paid to such Cash Offering Bondholders, the

Issuer shall accept

<<<

 the Cash Offered Bonds in excess of the Bond Cash Cancellation Minimum

in full.

(iii)

To the extent that the aggregate face value of the Cash Offered Bonds exceeds the Bond

Cash Cancellation Minimum and would, if accepted, require more

<<<

 than the Excess Cash

Amount to be paid to such Cash Offering Bondholders, the Issuer shall accept such Cash

Offered Bonds in full (or in part) up to the Excess Cash Amount and shall elect, in its

absolute discretion, whether to accept, in

<<<

 full or in part, such offers in excess of the Excess

Cash Amount. To the extent that the Issuer accepts any offers in part, it shall do so on a pro

rata basis, in respect of each Cash Offering Bondholder, in the proportion borne by its Cash

<<<



Offered Bonds to the aggregate of all Cash Offered Bonds.

For the purposes of the Voluntary Cash Offer described above, the "Bond Cash Cancellation Minimum" shall mean:

(i)

USD 30,000,000; or

(ii)

if the amount of the Equity

Voluntary Equity Exchange exceeds the Bond Conversion Minimum, USD

30,000,000 less 50% of such excess.

All the Bonds purchased by the Issuer in either of the Voluntary Buy-Backs shall be released

<<<

 and cancelled in full.
