1 BACKGROUND

<<<

 AND CORPORATE UPDATE On 23 March a Bondholders' meeting adopted resolutions pursuant to summons of 8 March 2011 regarding a proposed financial restructuring which comprised the issuing of a new one-year bond loan of NOK 50 million and a rights

<<<

 issue of new shares. The new issue was carried out during the period from 5 April to 19 April. A total of 212,946,563 shares were subscribed for at NOK 0.30 per share, which corresponds to gross proceeds of NOK 64 million. Further, the Issuer

<<<

 was given a waiver from the Bond Agreement Clause 13.5.2 and Clause 13,5.3, so that no Event of Default may be declared due to breach of these Clauses for the period from the date of the Bondholders' Meeting to 15 August 2011. The restructuring

<<<

 which was carried out during this spring is regarded as a temporarily solution by the parties.
The Issuer and the Bond Trustee and certain of its bondholders have thereafter been in a constructive dialogue to find a more long-term solution

<<<

 to the debt structure. The dialog includes e.g. extension of the maturity of the bonds and refinement of the covenant structure. The parties together aim to work out a long-term solution which meets their joint needs.
In the current year the

<<<

 company has continued its measures to reduce the cost base, primarily through a reduction of the workforce. Based on the company's contract coverage and outlook

NORSK TILLITSMANN

for 2011, the Company believes that it is possible to achieve positive operating margins in the current year. The company is still exposed to markets, particularly

<<<

 in Southern Europe, that also in 2011 are marked by uncertainty.
Bondholders representing more than 50% of the votes in the Bond Issue have committed to vote in favor of the proposal put forward in this summons.
Proposal
In accordance with

<<<

 Clause 17.1 of the Loan Agreement the Company has approached the Loan Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders meeting in order request a waiver in relation to the Bond Agreement, pursuant to the authority given to the Bondholders' meeting under

<<<

 Clause 16.1 of the Loan Bond Agreement.
As both the Issuer and certain of the bondholders see it as beneficial to allow sufficient time to fine tune a more long term structure of the bonds, The Company proposes as follows (the "Proposal"):

<<<


1.1 Waiver in relation to the Bond Agreement: The Following waiver is given:
The Issuer will be given a waiver in relation to Clause 13.5.2 and Clause 13.5.3 of the Bond Agreement, so that no Event of Default may be declared due to breach of

<<<

 these Clauses for the period from the date of the Bondholders' Meeting to 18 November 2011. Prior to the lapse of such period, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee, shall propose to a new Bondholders' Meeting revised financial covenants to be implemented

<<<

 in the Bond Agreement to reflect the Issuer's future financial position and outlook. In addition the Issuer and the Bond Trustee will propose an extension of the maturity of the bonds in order to better reflect the Issuer's financial situation

<<<

. If these proposals are approved by the new Bondholders' Meeting, the Bond Agreement shall be amended accordingly.
2 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL 2.1 The Issuer's evaluation The Issuer has previously evaluated various alternatives for a restructuring

<<<

 to meet its debt commitments and safeguard values for lenders. The current cash generation is not sufficient to meet the current debt amortization schedule. Consequently, a restructuring of among others the current amortization plan and covenants

<<<

 is required. The main objective with the proposed amendment is to safeguard values and secure a viable, long term financial platform for the Issuer. In the Issuer's view a more long term structure of the bond will benefit all stakeholders.

2.2 The Bond Trustee

<<<

's evaluation However, the Bond Trustee puts forward the proposal set out herein without any further evaluations or recommendation from the Bond Trustee.
The Bondholders must independently evaluate, based on available information, whether the

<<<

 Restructuring is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences of the Restructuring.
No due diligence investigations have been carried out by the

<<<

 Bond Trustee with respect to the Issuer and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein).
