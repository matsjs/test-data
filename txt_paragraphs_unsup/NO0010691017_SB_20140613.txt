Nordic

<<<

Terms defined in the Bond Agreement have the same meaning when used herein.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided

<<<

 by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Introduction
The Issuer's commercial shopping center TC Lumini (the "Lumini Project") in Croatia has now completed

<<<

 its grand opening and is operating according to plan. There is however still need for working capital to secure the future operation of the Lumini Project. The additional working capital need is approximately minimum NOK 9 million and maximum

<<<

 NOK 12 million and will be financed through additional tranches under the Bond Issue.
To address the Issuer's current financial situation, the Issuer is proposing certain amendments to the Bond Agreement which include reducing the interest

<<<

 rate to 6% p.a. and extending the Maturity Date to 30 June 2015. The Issuer also proposes that accrued interest as of 30 June 2014 is repaid to the Bondholders as payment in kind which is added to the principal of the Bond Issue.

2.2 Amendments to the Bond Agreement
2.2.1 Extension of the Maturity Date
The Maturity Date of the Bond Issue is 30 June 2014. The Issuer is currently not capable of repaying the Bond Issue on the Maturity Date as the Lumini Project requires

<<<

 capital and full refinancing of the Bond Issue through a bank facility has not been possible. Consequently the Issuer requests that the Bondholder Meeting consents to extending the Maturity Date under the Bond Issue to 30 June 2015.
2.2.2 Reduction

<<<

 of the interest rate
The current interest rate under the Bond Issue is 15% p.a. In order to improve the general financial condition of the Issuer and cater for future interest payments, the Issuer proposes that the interest rate under the Bond

<<<

 Issue is reduced to 6% p.a.
2.2.3 Repayment of accrued interest as of 30 June 2014 as payment in kind
The Issuer proposes that accrued interest in the Bond Issue as of 30 June 2014 is repaid to the Bondholders as payment in kind. This implies

<<<

 that Bondholders will receive additional Bonds in the Bond Issue as settlement for accrued interest. The numbers of Bonds issued to each Bondholder will be rounded down. The reason for rounding down is to ensure full settlement of all interest

<<<

 as of 30 June 2014 given the fact that the Bonds have a nominal value of NOK 1.
2.3 Proposed changes to the Second Priority Bond Issue
The Issuer has also proposed several amendments to the bond agreement for the Second Priority Bond Issue

<<<

. The Issuer's proposal is conditional upon consent from the bondholders in the Second Priority Bond Issue. If either the Bond Issue or the Second Priority Bond Issue votes against the Issuer's proposal, the proposed changes will not be effected

<<<

 and the Issuer is likely to default on its bond debt.
