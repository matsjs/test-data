<<<

 group as a whole.
Bluewater Holding B.V. is wholly owned by Aurelia Energy N.V., which published its half year results for the period ended June 30, 2015 on August 5, 2015.
For the first half year 2015, the Bluewater group, headed by Aurelia

<<<

 Energy N.V., reported net profit after tax amounting to U.S.$1.2 million compared to a profit of U.S.$5.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2014. EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 was U.S.$121.5 million compared

<<<

 to U.S.$86.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2014.
Second quarter results Bluewater Holding N.V. The net result after tax of Bluewater Holding N.V. for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 was U.S.$78.3 million loss compared

<<<

 to U.S.$67.3 million loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2014. EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 was U.S.$121.5 million compared to U.S.$86.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2014. The financial results

<<<

 for the first half year 2015 were mainly impacted by the following:
The SPM division generated U.S.$24.9 million EBITDA in the second quarter of 2015, resulting in U.S.$35.2 million EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared

<<<

 to U.S.$12.7 million EBITDA in the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2014. SPM results for the first half year of 2015 were driven by two large projects that started during 2014 and have achieved significant progress. These projects are expected

<<<

 to continue to contribute to EBITDA during the remainder of this year. In the first half year of 2014, progress on SPM projects was in early stages, resulting in less significant recording of EBITDA. Additionally, the SPM result for the first

<<<

 half year of 2015 was impacted positively due to the final close-out of earlier delivered projects.
The EBITDA for the FPSO division for the second quarter of 2015 was U.S.$42.0 million, resulting in an EBITDA for the six-month period ended

<<<

 June 30, 2015 of U.S.$87.9 million compared to U.S.$78.9 million for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2014. The U.S.$9.0 million increase in EBITDA compared to the first half year of 2014 was mainly driven by a U.S.$30.1 million increase

<<<

 in EBITDA for the FPSO Haewene Brim. This increase in EBITDA was due to U.S.$36.8 million amortization of deferred income in relation to the capitalized Brynhild project costs, partly offset by increased maintenance costs and reduced income

<<<

 due to constraints in production levels during the first half year of 2015. EBITDA for the FPSO Glas Dowr reduced by U.S.$16.2 million compared to the first half year of 2014, due to increased operational expenditures and credits on the daily

<<<

 hire rates as agreed in a contract amendment executed July 10, 2015. Additionally, EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm decreased by U.S.$4.3 million due to the decreased day rate following the contract amendment that became effective August 1,201

<<<

4. In the first half year of 2015, the lower day rate was not fully offset by the higher tariff income. EBITDA of the FPSO Aoka Mizu increased by U.S.$1.6 million as a result of an increased daily hire rate as from March 5, 2015 compared to

<<<

 the first six-months of the previous year. Finally the FPSO tender costs in 2015 increased by U.S.$2.2 million, mainly due to the tender activities in relation to redeployment of both the FPSO Munin and the FPSO Aoka Mizu.
During the first

<<<

 half year of 2015, overhead costs were U.S.$1.6 million, compared to U.S.$5.7 million unallocated expenses for the first half year of 2014. The higher overhead recovery was driven by increased
2

project activity and utilization of the engineering

<<<

 staff compared to the first half year of 2014. Additionally, euro denominated costs decreased as a result of the decreasing euro - dollar exchange rate during the first half year of 2015.
Depreciation and amortization expenditure for the first

<<<

 half year of 2015 amounted to U.S.$73.6 million compared to U.S.$41.8 million for the first half year of 2014. The increase was driven by the additional U.S.$36.8 million depreciation for the FPSO Haewene Brim following completion of the Brynhild

<<<

 project, partly offset by one of the assets being fully depreciated since April 2014.
Finance expenses are U.S.$2.9 million higher compared to the previous year, at U.S.$109.9 million versus U.S.$107.0 million in the first half year of 201

<<<

4. Interest on the subordinated loan due to parent company is U.S.$7.1 million higher compared to the previous year due to the interest being accrued to the loan balance each year. Finance expenses for the bond loan decreased by U.S.$1.4 million

<<<

, from U.S.$21.4 million for the first half year of 2014 to U.S.$20.0 million for the first half year of 2015. The bond loan interest in the first half year of 2014 included U.S.$1.4 million interest in relation to the U.S.$360 million unsecured

<<<

 bond loan that was repaid on January 27, 2014 and U.S.$20.0 million interest on the new U.S.$400 million bond loan. Additionally, finance expenses for the first half year of 2014 included U.S.$0.4 million of non-recurring costs in relation

<<<

 to the cancellation of the interest rate swap on the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond loan. Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$2.4 million compared to the previous year, due to further reduction of net debt, resulting from steady operating

<<<

 cash flow.
Currency exchange results were U.S.$11.1 million negative in the first half year of 2015 compared to U.S.$0.2 million positive in the first half year of 2014. The currency exchange results relate mainly to the negative fair value

<<<

 of euro denominated forward exchange contracts that were entered into to hedge the currency exposure on SPM projects.
Income tax expense for the first half year of 2015 amounted U.S.$5.3 million versus U.S.$4.7 million for the first half year

<<<

 of 2014. The income tax expense in the first half year of 2015 relates to U.S.$2.6 million withholding tax and U.S.$1.4 million Australian corporate tax in relation to the Glas Dowr, U.S.$0.6 million withholding tax incurred in relation to

<<<

 SPM revenues and U.S.$0.7 million corporate taxes in other jurisdictions. The U.S.$4.7 million income tax expense in the first half year of 2014 included U.S.$3.4 million withholding tax in relation to the Glas Dowr revenues and U.S.$1.3 million

<<<

 corporate taxes in other jurisdictions.
Other developments
On April 15, 2015, an insurance claim amounting to U.S.$2.3 million (EUR 2.1 million) was awarded to the Company by its insurers, in relation to the fire in Bluewater's test facility

<<<

 in 2014. As most costs incurred due to this incident have already been recognized during 2014, in accordance with the Company's accounting policy, these insurance proceeds contribute to the 2015 SPM result. The insurance proceeds have since

<<<

 been fully collected.
On June 12, 2015 ENI, on behalf of the JPDA 06-105 Joint Venture issued a notice of termination for convenience of the Glas Dowr Lease agreement. Cost reduction measures including a lower lease rate did not result in an

<<<

 economic sustainable production. A termination fee approximately equal to the outstanding lease payments until October 2016 is payable under the contract for termination for convenience. The termination fee and terms for operations until the

<<<

 termination date December 12, 2015 are agreed in a contract amendment executed July 10, 2015.
The Glas Dowr is scheduled to de-mobilise from the field location as of mid-December 2015. Remarketing opportunities are actively pursued.

General

<<<

 information Bluewater Holding B.V. ("the Company") is an intermediary holding company of the Bluewater group (Bluewater), a specialized service provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates

<<<

 floating production storage and offloading units ("FPSOs"), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops, performs project management and constructs single point mooring systems ("SPMs"). The Company is wholly owned

<<<

 by Aurelia Energy N.V., which published its half year results for the period ended June 30, 2015 on August 5, 2015. An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from

<<<

 offshore fields. FPSOs are either newly built or converted tankers upon which production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and water) are processed onboard the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported

<<<

 by an off take system utilizing shuttle tankers. Bluewater's fleet of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling, phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- or long

<<<

-term service contracts or bareboat contracts. SPMs are used to transfer fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker while securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. Most SPMs consist

<<<

 of an anchoring system that is connected to the ocean floor and a fluid transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids between fixed and rotating parts of the mooring system. SPMs are generally developed and constructed for oil companies

<<<

 and contractors. Revenues are earned from day rates consisting of a fixed facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases with oil companies, supplemented from time to time with fees based on volumes of produced barrels

<<<

 of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed. FPSO and SPM projects are

<<<

 being managed from the initial design and engineering phase to final installation. Further, Bluewater engages subcontractors in the fabrication of FPSOs, SPMs and auxiliary equipment.

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Reporting entity Bluewater Holding B.V. ("the Company") has its legal seat in Hoofddorp, the Netherlands. The unaudited condensed consolidated

<<<

 interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as "the Group" or "Bluewater" and individually as "Group entities") and the Group

<<<

's interest in jointly controlled entities.
Statement of compliance The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs

<<<

) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements.
Basis of preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial

<<<

 information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared based on the same accounting policies and methods as those of the annual financial statements

<<<

 for the year ended December 30, 2014. The information furnished in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management

<<<

, necessary for fair presentation of such financial statements. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited interim condensed consolidated

<<<

 financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 30, 2014.
The preparation of these unaudited interim financial statements requires management to make judgements

<<<

, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed

<<<

 on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in

<<<

 applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the unaudited interim financial statements are:
· Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method; ·

<<<

 Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned with the leased facilities; · Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forward; · Potential impact of claims and litigation.
Sales and operating results for

<<<

 the six months ended June 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
1. Segment reporting
The disclosure of segment information is consistent with the internal reports regularly reviewed by the

<<<

 Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segment's performance and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments since the Company's risks and rates of return are affected primarily

<<<

 by differences in services and products produced.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly employee

<<<

 benefits expense, head office expenses, investments and related revenue and income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues.
