Rubicon Offshore Holdings Limited Group Management Financial Statements For the three months ended 30 September 2011
Background
Rubicon is an offshore oilfield service company focused on the ownership and operation

<<<

 of two floating, production, storage and off-loading vessels ("FPSOs").
Management review
Rubicon is pleased to present its latest management report.
The Rubicon Intrepid is located at the Galoc Field, offshore the Philippines, where it is

<<<

 contracted to the Galoc Production Company ("GPC"). During the 3rd quarter, the vessel remained connected throughout and achieved production uptime of approximately 98.4% (98.7% 2011 YTD).
As previously reported, in early July 2011, Rubicon

<<<

 signed an agreement with GPC under which the Rubicon Intrepid will undergo a significant upgrade of the mooring system through the installation of a turret mooring system on the FPSO. Construction of the turret at Keppel Shipyard in Singapore

<<<

 continued through the quarter. In order to accommodate the incorporation into the turret of additional production swivels that will be required for a Phase 2 development of the field, at the request of GPC, the original schedule for completion

<<<

 of the upgrade was deferred by approximately two months, with completion now expected in Q1 2012.

The Rubicon Vantage is located at the Bualuang Field, offshore Thailand, where

<<<

 it is contracted to Salamander Energy. The vessel continued to achieve good levels of production uptime during the 3rd quarter of 99.7% (99.6% 2011 YTD). As previously reported, the sale of the Rubicon Maverick for US$35.5m was completed in

<<<

 July 2011 and the entire proceeds used to repay the equivalent value of bonds at par. Recent events On 24 November 2011, production on the Rubicon Intrepid was shut-in as part of the preparations for the FPSO leaving the Galoc Field to sail

<<<

 to Singapore, where the turret will be integrated with the FPSO at Keppel Shipyard. The shipyard works are expected to take some 60 days and it is intended that the FPSO will be re-installed at the field and resume production by around 1 March
