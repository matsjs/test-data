Item 6- The Company informs about its financial position

Background

Overall, volatile economic environment

<<<

 in Ukraine and Russia have impacted the financial results of the Company. In 2013 the Company decided to divest its non-profitable Russian cereal production clusters (discontinued operations) and focus on the Ukrainian business (continuing

<<<

 operation), however considering the worsening economic climate, finding buyers with acceptable terms proved challenging. Therefore, financial results for 2014 and onwards were influenced by the divestment processes and devaluation of the Rouble

<<<

 and Hryvna as in 2015 the Company booked a net loss of EUR 49.2 million from discontinued operations, relating to the revaluation of the Russian business to fair value and currency translation differences.
The restructuring of the business

<<<

 continued during the first half of 2016, with the most significant event being the divestment of the Rostov business for the price of EUR 13.3 million, allowing full repayment of the Rietumu bank loan (including interest) of EUR 8 million.

<<<

 The net proceeds from the sale were used to pay the annual interest of the Bonds on 31 August 2016 and the balance was released to the Company as working capital. The loss from the Rostov divestment during the first half of 2016 amounted to

<<<

 EUR 22.1 million, out of which currency translation differences in the amount of EUR 19.9 million were recycled from "other comprehensive income" to the income statement.
Cost reductions in operations
In order to improve its financial results

<<<

, the Company has focused on a continuous reduction of its costs, especially related to overhead. The Company has relocated its head office in Tallinn to more modest premises and is now operating with a reduced team which has lowered the costs

<<<

 by EUR 0.3 million for the first half of 2016. The termination of the management fee paid to the Company's previous management services provider (AS Trigon Capital) since 1 January 2016 has further contributed to the cost saving for the Company

<<<

 (EUR 2.5 million in 2015). In total, the EBITDA for continuing operations (excluding Rostov business) increased from EUR 9.7 million during the first half of 2015 to EUR 12.3 million during the first half of 2016, showing a strong improvement

<<<

 in efficiency.
Current trading
The Company demonstrated strong operational results. It finished the 2016 winter crop harvest in August with yields above expectations although the crop was affected by a dry autumn in 2015. Rainfall levels have

<<<

 been variable in July and August across the regions where the Company operates: generally the Nikolaev and Kirovograd regions have been relatively dry, whilst the Kharkov region has been quite wet. This was positive for the summer crops in

<<<

 the Kharkov region, but did raise some quality issues with wheat. The 2016 oilseed rape crop yielded an average of 1.5 tonnes/ ha which was as forecasted. Sowing of the 2017 crop commenced at the end of July and is expected to be completed

<<<

 by the end of October 2016. This year there is at present adequate moisture for germination. For the 2017 winter wheat harvest the Company is targeting 22 thousand ha. In summary the yields of wheat and oilseed rape were as expected, somewhat

<<<

 lower than the Company's 5-year average, due to as reported in May, having been adversely affected by the very dry autumn in 2015. It should however be noted that the direct inputs, particularly nitrogen fertilizer were reduced significantly

<<<

 on these crops in recognition of the perceived lower potential, so that the costs were in effect tailored to the potential yield. In total fertilizer costs were reduced by EUR 1.7 million for 1H 2016.
Considering the positive harvest results

<<<

 coupled with the signed export contracts trading at a premium compared to the domestic prices, the Company expects higher revenue from the sales of the 2016 harvest notwithstanding the bottomed commodity prices worldwide. Overall, the Ukrainian

<<<

 business is showing relatively positive development trend and is expected to benefit even more from the rise in prices.
However, losses from the divestment coupled with the devaluations of the currencies severely damaged the balance sheet and

<<<

 income statement of the Company putting at risk the fulfilment by the Company of its financial obligations to the creditors. The situation was worsened by the monetary and foreign currency control legislation in Ukraine which still is a considerable

<<<

 obstacle in managing group-wide cash requirements outside of Ukraine. It also adversely affected and continues to affect the ability of the Company to meet its financing obligations at the parent company level including the possibility to pay

<<<

 interest, deposit quarterly payments and repay the principal amount of the Bonds.
Way forward
In the beginning of 2016 the Company initiated a process for a partial debt to equity swap which was accepted by the Holders 27 April 2016 (available

<<<

 at: http://www.triaonaari.com/triaon-aari-as-bondholders-have-approved-proposals-submitted-for-votina-in-written-procedure/). Despite the costs reductions and improved production the new board of directors of the Company has come to the conclusions

<<<

 that a full debt to equity swap is needed for the Company to meet its obligations in the short and long run as the Company in the current macro- and microeconomic environment is not able to meet its financial obligations and initiated discussions

<<<

 with major shareholders and Holders which led to a preliminary agreement on the main terms and conditions of a proposed full conversion of the SEK 350,000,000 11% bonds (ISIN SE0004019008) (the "Bonds") into new shares of the Company. The full

<<<

 debt to equity conversion will allow the Company to overcome various negative factors in the medium and long term. The anticipated stabilization of the Ukrainian and Russian currencies is expected to improve the value of the asset base of the

<<<

 Company allowing also for higher value of the collaterals for the banks.
The full conversion of the Bonds will enable the Company to manage and fulfil its existing financial obligations as opposed to defaulting on them. Thus, the Company will

<<<

 be able to prolong its working capital loans for 2017 as one of the preconditions of the Ukrainian working capital loans prolongation/renewal is decreasing by the Company of the outstanding obligations under the Bonds. Failure to convert the

<<<

 Bonds into equity will lead to the Company's inability to fulfil its obligation to repay working capital loans to the Ukrainian banks. Furthermore, the conversion of the Bonds into equity will allow the Company to improve its balance sheet

<<<

 by reducing its interest bearing liabilities of EUR 54.8 million to EUR 14.2 million (as stated in the last second quarter 2016 report). Thus going forward, the Company will have a much stronger balance sheet and also reduced interest costs

<<<

 as it will not have to pay the Bonds' annual interest in amount of SEK 38.5 million (approximately EUR 4 million).
With financial liabilities managed and without the pressure of the potential default, the Company can focus on the development

<<<

 of its profitable Ukrainian business and its assets such as machinery, infrastructure and land to generate higher income. Considering the current bottomed prices, the Company has a strong advantage after the recovery of the current low price

<<<

 environment.
Conversion of the Bonds into equity of the Company is seen as the most adequate and efficient solution to the current financial situation of the Company enabling it to continue its operation focusing on enhancing the profitability

<<<

 of its business in Ukraine.
Item 7.1- Description of the main features of the proposal to amend and restate the terms and conditions to enable a full debt to equity swap
The key features of the restructuring is (i) a full debt-to-equity swap

<<<

, through a capital increase by debt conversion, of the Bonds into new ordinary shares in the Company into up to 1,598,730,000 new shares, ranking pari passu with all currently existing shares in the Company, and (ii) the offer to all of the

<<<

 shareholders of the Company, to receive 21 warrants for each 13 shares held in the Company, each warrant allowing for subscription for one (1) share, for a total of up to 209,398,236 shares if all warrants are exercised. The new shares will

<<<

 be listed

on Nasdaq Stockholm Main Market .The warrants will be listed either on Nasdaq Stockholm Main Market or on Nasdaq First North.

As announced in the 14 September 2016 press release of the Company (available at: http://www.trigonagri

<<<

.com/trigon-agri-as-preliminaryagreement-on-the-full-debt-to-equity-swap/) the Company has reached a preliminary agreement with its major shareholders and Holders on the main terms and conditions of a proposed full conversion of all the Bonds

<<<

 into the new shares of the Company. The more de-tailed terms and conditions of the full conversion of the Bonds into new shares are available on http://www.trigonagri.com/wpcontent/uploads/2016/09/Formal-debt-equity-swap-offer-2016-09-05.pdf

<<<

. As a condition for the abovementioned restructuring to occur, the Holders must vote in favour of the restructuring and certain other matters, with the majority and quorum requirements as required in the Terms and Conditions. As of the date

<<<

 of this notice Holders controlling 21,780 Bonds with the total nominal amount of SEK 217,800,000 representing 62.22% of the total amount of Bonds have communicated their binding commitment and intention to approve the terms of the full conversion

<<<

 of the Bonds into new shares.

The proposal to the Holders may be summarised as follows:

This proposal to amend and restate the Terms and Conditions is to enable the conversion of the Bonds into new shares of the Company where 1 Bond with

<<<

 a nominal value of SEK 10,000 will give right to 45,678 shares in the Company.

Please note that, as stated above, the Company will make a simultaneous issue of warrants to the current shareholders of the Company where 13 shares will give right

<<<

 to receive 21 warrants each giving the holder the right to subscribe to one share in the Company at a subscription price of EUR 0.02 or EUR 0.03 depending on when the subscription is made.

The Holders are asked to amend the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 and to make possible the conversion of the outstanding Bonds in the total amount of SEK 350,000,000 into equity of the Company, meaning that in return for their claims on the Bonds and accrued interest each Holder will receive shares in the

<<<

 Company. Each SEK 10,000 bond will entitle the Holder to 45,678 shares in the Company.

The new shares will be issued to the Holders, and the warrants to the shareholders, as soon as possible following the approval and publication of a prospectus

<<<

.

Following the completion of the conversion of the Bonds and issue of new shares, the share capital of the Company will be allocated as follows*:

* In order to secure Danish company law compliance and

<<<

 avoid roundings it has been necessary to amend the conversion/allocation ratios to the effect that each SEK 10,000 Bond gives right to 45,678 shares and in respect of the warrants the allocation ratio has been changed to the effect that each

<<<

 13 existing shares gives right to receive 21 warrants. Please note that the ownership percentage ratios will remain approximately as previously announced.

 proposal by the major Holders and the major shareholders.

Therefore, immediately following the completion of the conversion of the Bonds into new shares of the Company (and assuming no exercise of the warrants) the Holders will in aggregate
