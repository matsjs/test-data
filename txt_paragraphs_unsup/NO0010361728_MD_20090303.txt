RRUBICON OFFSHORE INTERNATIONAL
Rubicon Offshore Holdings Limited Group Management Financial Statements For the 12 months ended 31 December 2008
Background
Rubicon is an offshore oilfield service company providing life-of-field development solutions

<<<

 by deploying its fleet of two floating, production, storage and off-loading vessels ("FPSOs") and a multi-service vessel ("MSV").
Management review
Rubicon is pleased to present its latest management report.
As previously reported, the Rubicon

<<<

 Intrepid successfully achieved production of first oil from the Galoc Field, offshore the Philippines, on 9 October 2008. Subsequent to this, the vessel performed well with minimal downtime for a period of over two months.
On 14 December 2

<<<

008, due to adverse weather conditions and in compliance with standard operating procedures in such circumstances, the MRS was disconnected from the FPSO and laid on the sea-bed. Subsequent inspection of the MRS revealed that a component part

<<<

 had become partially detached and required reinstatement prior to reconnection of the MRS to the FPSO. At the same time as undertaking this remedial work, it was decided to install a hold back mooring system ("HBMS"), which is designed to improve

<<<

 the FPSO's ability to maintain station and reduce the frequency of occurrences that adverse weather conditions require disconnection of the MRS. In order to carry out this work, Rubicon mobilized the Rubicon Maverick, including a saturation

<<<

 diving team, as well as two further support vessels. Installation of the HBMS and reconnection of the MRS was completed in late February and production recommenced on 25 February 2009.
The Rubicon Vantage has been in production on the Bualuang

<<<

 Field, offshore Thailand, since first oil on 27 August 2008 and has continued to achieve good rates of production uptime. As previously reported, the limited capacity of the field's water injection wells limits production levels.

The Rubicon Vantage
As referred to above, the Rubicon Maverick fulfilled a key role in the remedial work undertaken at the Galoc Field. Having finished this assignment, the vessel is currently being mobilized for a subsea

<<<

 installation contract in Malaysia. Rubicon is also actively pursuing other new contracts for the vessel.
The Rubicon Maverick assisting with the remedial work at the Galoc Field

RRUBICON OFFSHORE INTERNATIONAL
The production downtime at the

<<<

 Galoc Field and the costs of the remedial work have had an adverse effect on cashflows. Rubicon therefore continues to focus on careful management of cash, stabilizing operations and maximizing uptime for the FPSOs and utilization of the Rubicon

<<<

 Maverick. Rubicon's shareholder, Rubicon Offshore International Holdings Limited, has continued to provide support to Rubicon, including through the capitalization of US$47 million of shareholder loans during the year.
