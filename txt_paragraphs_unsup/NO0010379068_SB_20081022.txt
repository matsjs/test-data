Oslo, October 22, 2008
PROPOSAL TO AMEND LOAN AGREEMENT - SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING

Background
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"

<<<

 / "Norsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bonds") in the above-captioned loan (the "Loan") consisting of a Fixed Rate Tranche of NOKm 2300 (NOROl) and a FNR Tranche of NOKm 500 (NOR02) where Norwegian Energy Company

<<<

 ASA ("NORECO" / the "Company") is the borrower.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement dated 9th July 2007 (the "Loan Agreement") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise

<<<

 stated.
Since the Bonds were issued in July 2007 NORECO has completed the acquisition and integration of Altinex ASA. The Company has delivered solid operational performance and strengthened its financial position by issuing new equity to acquire

<<<

 more producing assets. Eight out of the first nine exploration and appraisal wells which the Company has participated in to date have been successful, creating significant value which can be further monetized through field development or asset

<<<

 sales. Management is also very pleased with delivering strong cash flow from production, currently ~30% above the forecast provided at the time of the issue of the Loan in July 2007.
Looking back, NORECO has successfully raised in excess of

<<<

 NOK 1,200 million in new equity in connection with the IPO, acquisition of 30% interest in the producing Siri license in Denmark and through conversion of convertible bonds. This amount exceeds the amount of new equity that the Company indicated

<<<

 to raise at the time of the bond issue last year and underlines NORECO's commitment to both grow the company and reduce the financial leverage.
NORECO has several interesting field developments in the pipeline whereby Nini East and Fluntington

<<<

 are the first fields expected to come on-stream in 2009 and 2010. Production from these fields, in addition to optimization of production from existing

fields, are expected to significantly increase the production from the current

<<<

 level of approx. 15,400 boe/day (average production in 3Q 2008).
NORECO recognizes the challenging financial markets and is committed to its communicated strategy which entails refinancing of expensive debt and repayment of bonds to reduce

<<<

 leverage. In May 2008 the Geopard bond (NOK 660 million) was refinanced with cheaper and more flexible reserve based lending by a bank syndicate which reduced the Company's interest cost by approx. NOK 35 million on an annualized basis. In

<<<

 addition, the Company is constantly considering its strategic options, such as possible divestment of certain assets, freeing up cash, strengthening book equity and further repayment of outstanding bonds.
The Proposed amendments to the Loan

<<<

 Agreement:
The Company proposes the following amendments (the "Proposal") in the Loan Agreement:
Delete Existing Covenant The Loan Agreement contains the following covenant that the Company proposes to delete:
"Marked Adjusted Equity Ratio

<<<

 I" (Clause 13.3 (c) of the Loan Agreement).
Redemption o f NOK 560 million at 100.0% of par value Upon approval of the proposed deletion of the Market Adjusted Equity Ratio I covenant, NORECO will make a partial early redemption of totally

<<<

 NOK 560 million, whereof NOK 460 million in NOR01 (the Fixed Rate Tranche) and NOK 100 million in NOR02 (the FNR Tranche). The redemption shall be effected at 100.0% of par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount) on 13th November

<<<

 2008 (with record date the day after the Bondholders' Meeting). The early redemption will be made pro rata (according to the procedures of the Security Depository) to the outstanding Bonds in each Tranche under the Loan.
The proposals are included

<<<

 as Annex 1 to this summons.
Bondholders in need of further information may contact Norsk Tillitsmann ASA at +47 22 87 94 00.
The Company has engaged Pareto Securities AS as the Company's financial advisor with respect to the Proposal. Bondholders

<<<

 may accordingly contact Pareto Securities Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70 for further information.
Evaluation of the proposed changes
NORECO proposes to delete the Market Adjusted Equity Ratio I covenant in the Loan Agreement and make

<<<

 an early redemption of Bonds to reduce leverage and remove negative focus on this covenant. Recent market volatility has become challenging with respect to the Market Adjusted Equity Ratio I which does not necessarily reflect the actual operational

<<<

 performance of the Company. In order to mitigate negative focus on the Company's financial structure, NORECO proposes deletion of the Market Adjusted

Summons Letter

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
Equity Ratio I covenant by giving Bondholders the

<<<

 opportunity to get partly redemption of their Bonds approximately 1.5 years in advance of Maturity Date. In NORECO's view, all the Company's stakeholders will benefit from these measures and the proposal underlines NORECO's commitment to deleverage

<<<

 the Company.
NORECO is determined to take a proactive approach to further deleverage the Company and strengthening its balance sheet. In NORECO's view, Bondholders benefit from the Proposal; both through de-leveraging of the Company which results

<<<

 in improved Loan to Value and significant uplift in the price of the Bonds being redeemed. Furthermore, NORECO believes that the share price should respond positively on the removal of this covenant giving additional positive effect for the

<<<

 Bondholders through potential improved pricing of the remaining outstanding Bonds.
NORECO is taking available cash generated on back of strong production and high oil prices by offering NOK 560 million of the Loan for redemption. In the Company

<<<

's opinion, this shows that NORECO is committed to redeem as much as possible of the Loan without jeopardizing the Company's investment program. The Company will continue to consider various strategic alternatives such as asset sales to further

<<<

 redeem Bonds and deleverage the Company, thereby allocating additional cash to the Bondholders in advance of maturity date for the remaining outstanding Bonds.
According to Clause 16.1 and Clause 17.8 of the Loan Agreement, the proposed amendments

<<<

 require the approval of the Bondholders. Such approval ought to be given if the offered compensation is valued as fair vs. the proposed changes and their effect on the Loan's (future) creditworthiness.
It is the opinion of NORECO that the Bondholders

<<<

 are offered a fair and balanced compensation for the proposed amendments in the Loan Agreement. NORECO has already received pre-acceptances from the majority of the Bondholders.
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further

<<<

 evaluation or recommendations from NTM. NTM points out that the Bondholders themselves have to evaluate the proposal described herein. It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences of the

<<<

 Proposal.
