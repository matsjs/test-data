 NO 001 066095.4)
Oslo, 28 November 2014

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - REQUEST FOR AMENDMENTS
Nordic Trustee ASA, (formerly Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee")) acts as trustee for the bondholders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the

<<<

 above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where Hoegh LNG Holdings Ltd. (the "Issuer") is the issuer.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally dated 28 September 2012 and

<<<

 made between the Bond Trustee and the Issuer, as amended by a first amendment agreement dated 10 October 2013 and as further amended and restated by a second amendment and restatement agreement dated 30 July 2014 (the "Bond Agreement"), unless

<<<

 otherwise stated herein.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1

BACKGROUND

The

<<<

 Issuer is a fully integrated floating LNG services company, offering long-term floating production, transportation regasification and terminal solutions for the LNG market. The Group operates a fleet of four LNG transportation vessels and five

<<<

 floating storage and regasification units ("FSRUs") and have two FSRUs under construction.

Since the time of the Bond Issue, the Issuer has consistently delivered according to its business plan and has today a significantly improved credit

<<<

 profile. In August 2014, the initial public offering of Hoegh LNG Partners LP (the "MLP") was successfully closed, and the Issuer is considerably derisked with higher capitalization and a proven capital market track record.

The Issuer has

<<<

, through the establishment of the MLP, raised sufficient equity to order several new FSRUs. However, due to the increase of the Issuer's balance sheet since the time of the Bond Issue, the capital incurrence test contained in Clause 13.4 (j

<<<

) of the Bond Agreement prevents the Issuer from ordering more than one FSRU at this point in time. A delay in the ordering of a second FSRU would likely result in loss of valuable delivery slots and higher overall newbuilding prices, and thus

<<<

 have a negative impact on the Issuer's ability to pursue attractive business opportunities. Hence, the capital incurrence test causes an unforeseen adverse impact on the Issuer's growth plans. To prevent such a potential negative impact on

<<<

 the Issuer's business, the Issuer requests that Clause 13.4 (j) is deleted from the Bond Agreement. As a consequence, Clause 13.4 (k) ("Bareboat Charters") should also be deleted from the Bond Agreement, as this covenant represents a carve

<<<

-out from the capital incurrence test contained in Clause 13.4 (j).

Further, the Issuer is seeking flexibility to obtain a stable and predictable dividend policy, which includes payment o f dividends already in 2015. Due to the retrospective

<<<

 net profit test included in Clause 13.5 a) o f the Bond Agreement, the Issuer is currently prevented from paying dividends in 2015.

Equity markets, as one component o f the Issuer's capital markets strategy, are increasingly showing attention

<<<

 to dividend policies and restrictions. Strong access to equity markets is important to support the growth strategy of the Issuer, and also benefits creditors by ensuring a range of attractively-priced options for future capital.

The Issuer

<<<

 proposes taking a balanced approach to support its capital markets strategy, readily acknowledging that an increase in its dividend flexibility must be accomplished in a manner that, in the Issuer's view, is broadly credit-neutral for the Bondholders

<<<

. As discussed further below, the Issuer proposes to change the dividend restriction in the Bond Agreement to allow the Issuer to pay distributions up to a defined amount for each share each year, provided that the Issuer complies with the existing

<<<

 distribution incurrence tests. As a structural compensation for the amendment to the dividend distribution clause, the Issuer will forego the flexibility to distribute dividends in excess of the defined amounts, a flexibility which the Issues

<<<

 has under the current covenant subject to the net profit test included in Clause 13.5 being met.

To accommodate the ordering of new FSRUs as planned and the Issuer's request for payment o f dividends, the Issuer has requested certain amendments

<<<

 to be made to the Bond Agreement, as further described in paragraph 2 below.

PROPOSAL

In accordance with Clause 16.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has asked the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting for the Bond Issue in order

<<<

In Clause 1.1 (Definitions), the following

<<<

A t any time after 31 December 2014, the aggregate Distribution in respect o f each o f the Issuer's common shares in any

<<<

 financial year specified in Column 1 below shall not exceed the amount set out in Column 2 below opposite that financial year:

provided that:

(i) no Distribution may be made unless, subsequent to the Distribution, (A) the ratio of Book Equity to Total Assets is at least 30%; and (B) the Free Group Cash is no less then USD

<<<

 50,000,000; and
(ii) if and whenever there shall be a consolidation, reclassification or subdivision in relation to the Issuer's common shares, the amounts set out in Column 2 above shall be adjusted by multiplying them by the following fraction

<<<

:

A B

where:

A

is the aggregate number o f the Issuer's commons shares in issue

immediately before such consolidation, reclassification or

subdivision, as the case may be; and

B

is the aggregate number of the Issuer's common shares in

<<<

 issue

immediately after, and as a result of, such consolidation,

reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be.

Any un-utilized portion o f the permitted Distribution may not be earned forward."

3

AMENDMENT FEE

As compensation to

<<<

 the Bondholders for approving the proposal, the Issuer offers the Bondholders a one-time amendment fee of 0.85% (flat) of the face value o f the Bonds, payable to the Bondholders (with record date on the end of business on the date of the Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting) ten (10) Business Days after the Bondholders' Meeting has approved the proposal set out in this section 2.

4

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

4.1 The issuer's evaluation
Having consistently delivered on its business plan,

<<<

 the Issuer is today considerably de-risked compared to the situation at the time o f the Bond Issue, with higher capitalization and a proven capital market track record. The Issuer understands that any amendments to the Bond Agreement need

<<<

 to be evaluated carefully, but is o f the view that the changes requested will not materially impact the credit profile o f the Issuer due to the following:

When the Bonds were issued, the Issuer had significant capital expenditure commitments

<<<

, and the specific restrictions on the incurrence of capital expenditure were included in the Bond Agreement to make sure the Issuer did not commit to further capital expenditure without first raising the necessary equity. Today, this restriction

<<<

 has an unforeseen adverse

Page 3 of 7

impact on the Group's business. Therefore, the Issuer believes that it is in all stakeholders' interest to remove this covenant. The Group's incurrence of capital expenditure will still be restricted

<<<

 by the more customary equity ratio already included in the Bond Agreement, which require that the Group at all times shall maintain a Book Equity of no less than the higher of (i) USD 200,000,000; and (ii) 27.5% of Total Assets.

Strong equity

<<<

 capital markets access is an important element o f the Issuer's capital market strategy and impoitant to support the growth strategy o f the Issuer. While the MLP is the primary instrument for equity capital raising, having access to a diversified

<<<

 range o f equity funding sources is beneficial to all stakeholders, including Bondholders, and pursuing a competitively priced equity instrument in the Issuer is therefore prudent.

The Issuer has engaged Pareto Securities AS as its financial

<<<

 advisor (the "Advisor") with respect to the proposal set out herein. Accordingly, Bondholders may contact Pareto Securities AS Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70 for further information.

The Advisor is acting solely for, and relying on

<<<

 information from, the Issuer in connection with the proposal set out herein. No due diligence investigation has been carried out by the Advisor with respect to the Issuer, and the Advisor does not assume any liability in connection with the

<<<

 proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein).

4.2

Support from the Bondholders

Prior to this summons letter being distributed, the Issuer has informed the Trustee that they have received commitments from several

<<<

 o f the largest Bondholders in ISIN NO 001 066095.4 who will support the proposal.

4.3

The Bond Trustee's evaluation

The amendment request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee

<<<

. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
