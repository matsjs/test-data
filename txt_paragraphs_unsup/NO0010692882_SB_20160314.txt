 Bond Issue 2013/2018"
Oslo, 14/03/2016
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA, formerly known as Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, is appointed as Bond Trustee for the above mentioned Bond issue.
Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined

<<<

 herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally entered into on dated 11 November 2013 (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer, the described transactions, the market conditions

<<<

 and the Proposal set out in Section 3 below are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
This summons letter is issued upon the Issuer's request. Bondholders are

<<<

 encouraged to read this summons letter in its entirety.
1 BACKGROUND
Shamaran Petroleum Corp (the "Ultimate Parent") and the Issuer (General Exploration Partners, Inc.) and (the "Company") (together "the Group"), is hereby providing an update

<<<

 on the ongoing Atrush project and background for the proposed refinancing and waivers to achieve first oil.
The Company has identified a liquidity gap which must be addressed in order to be able to fund its share of field development costs

<<<

 which comes as a result of various factors. The Company and its partners in the Atrush block have faced a challenging situation in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The fragile economic and security situation coupled with engineering and supply

<<<

 chain constraints has caused delays to the development schedule as earlier communicated. The Operator is currently targeting first oil mid-2016.
Based on the current spending forecast, the Company estimates an approx. USD 34 million liquidity

<<<

 deficit to reach first oil and positive cash flow from Atrush oil production and sales. This amount assumes the minimum amount of required investments as set out by the Atrush Operator plus Group overhead expenses, working capital and interest

<<<

 payments on the Bonds.
2 PROPOSAL
In accordance with Clause 16.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' meeting in order to obtain the Bondholders' approval to make the amendments as described

<<<

 below (the "Proposal"):

2/7
2.1 New Super Senior Bond
In order to finance the shortfall, the Issuer has been offered a new loan of USD 17 million on a fully underwritten basis by the Lundin family. The proposed new loan is a super senior

<<<

 bond (the "Super Senior Bond") which will have joint security with the Bonds but with the Super Senior Bonds on a first ranking basis while the Bonds will be ranked second. Consequently the Super Senior Bond requires a subordination of the

<<<

 Bonds' security to a second rank. The Super Senior Bond is intended as a bridge loan to enable the company to get into positive cash flow, after which the loan may be repaid as quickly as possible and the Bonds will revert to its original security

<<<

 position and ranking as soon as the Super Senior Bond is fully repaid.
The Super Senior Bond will be offered on a pro-rata basis to existing holders of the Bonds on a private placement basis and holders may contact Pareto Securities to subscribe

<<<

 for Super Senior Bonds.
The Super Senior Bond will carry most of the same terms and conditions as the Bonds, including interest rate and maturity but the Issuer will have the option to pay interests in kind ("PIK"). In order to have flexibility

<<<

 to address any potential financing requirements in the future it is proposed to have a tap issue mechanism in the Super Senior Bond with a total borrowing limit of USD 50 million including the initial tranche and any PIK interests but excluding

<<<

 any cash interest and cost. The Term Sheet for the Super Senior Bond is enclosed as Appendix 2 to this Summons.
In order to facilitate the new Super Senior Bond, the holders of the Bonds are requested to accept certain waivers and amendments

<<<

 to the Bond Agreement which are outlined below.
2.2 Offer to convert up to USD 18 million of principal to Equity
The Issuer will offer the Bondholder the option to convert up to USD 18 million of the principal of the Bond Issue into equity

<<<

 in the Ultimate Parent, based on the prevailing share price at the launch of the debt to equity offer (which will be when the amendment agreement is entered into, which is expected to occur shortly after the date of the Bondholder's meeting

<<<

 accepting the Proposal) however at a share price of no less than the equivalent to CAD 0.05 per share as required pursuant to certain TSX Venture Exchange requirements. The debt to equity offer is subject to approval of the TSX Venture Exchange

<<<

 and of the Board of Directors of the Ultimate Parent.
The new shares are subject to a four month trading restriction in Canada as described below.
The issue of new shares by conversion of up to USD 18 million of the principal will be carried

<<<

 out as a debt to equity offer based on application agreements, where each Bondholder is to decide which amount (if any) it will apply for in the debt to equity offer to be converted into shares. There shall be a pro rata allocation among Existing

<<<

 Bondholders upon oversubscription. The Company is considering offering a subsequent private placement of shares for cash for the remainder if USD 18 million is not covered by the conversion as described above.
The Bonds will be split 1:100

<<<

.000 with new face value USD 1 per Bond in connection with the conversion.
2.3 Interest payments in-kind
The Issuer also proposes that the interest payments on the Bonds in 2016 (falling due in May and November, as well as the accrued interests

<<<

 on the principal amount that are converted to equity up until such conversion takes place) are settled in kind by way of issuing additional Bonds. This will, combined with minimum USD 17 million in new funding from the Super Senior Bond, bridge

<<<

 the expected liquidity gap in the capital budget.

3/7

The Issuer also proposes to have the option to settle interest payments in 2017 and onwards in kind by way of issuing additional Bonds until the Super Senior Bond is repaid in full.


<<<

 at the date when the offer is launched however at a share price of no less than CAD 0.05 per share.
The debt to equity offer will be directed to the Bondholders being registered at the record date (to be set after the relevant Bondholders'

<<<

 Meeting). Bondholders resident in Canada will however not receive the offer as a matter of Canadian law, and the offer will be restricted to U.S. Investors representing to be Qualified Institutional Buyers. The new shares are subject to trading

<<<

 restrictions under Canadian law implying that the shares may not, for the period of four months from the issue date, be sold on the TSX Venture Exchange or otherwise in Canada or to any purchaser the seller knows to be a Canadian resident.

Schedule 1 - Principal Terms of Intercreditor Agreement

Background and parties:

The Joint Security will be a single security package for the payment obligations

<<<

 of the Obligors under the finance documents for the Bonds and Existing Bonds (the "Secured Debt"). The Trustee will be appointed as Security Agent to hold the Joint Security on behalf of the Bondholders and the Existing Bondholders respectively

<<<

 (each a "Secured Creditor Class").

The Intercreditor Agreement will be entered into by:

1. the Obligors; 2. the Trustee acting as Security Agent and Trustee for each Secured Creditor Class; 3. Any Group Company with an Intercompany Claim

<<<

.

Any Group Company subsequently acquiring an Intercompany Claim must adhere to the Intercreditor Agreement as a party.

The Intercreditor Agreement will reflect the ranking among these creditor parties as set out below.

Status and rank in

<<<

 Joint Security:

The Secured Debt shall rank as follows:
The Bonds and Existing Bonds rank pari-passu in terms of payment other than as provided for below. Interest, cost and other amounts payable under the Existing Bonds may be paid until

<<<

 the issuance of an Initial Enforcement Notice.

The payment obligations under the Finance Documents for the Bonds up to the Borrowing Limit (the "Super Senior Obligations"), shall be discharged in full before any payment of the payment obligations

<<<

 under the finance documents for the Existing Bonds in respect of repayments with proceeds from the enforcement of any Joint Security, including any voluntary disposals of any Joint Security, as further provided for in the payment waterfall

<<<

 definition. The Existing Bonds shall be fully subordinated to the Super Senior Obligations in respect of proceeds from insolvency proceedings in any of the Obligors.

Subordination of Intercompany Claims:
Payment waterfall:

Intercompany Claims

<<<

 shall be fully subordinated to the Secured Debt, with no payment of principal or interest or costs (other than the payments provided for under "Purpose of the Bond") prior to the Secured Debt being fully discharged and no acceleration rights

<<<

 upon an event of default. The Intercreditor Agreement shall include inter alia provisions for turnover of payments received by Group Companies in conflict with these principles.
The proceeds of enforcement or any other direct or indirect realisation

<<<

, sale or disposal or disbursement of insurance sums of any assets over which a Joint Security is created under the Security Documents (including any voluntary or distressed disposal pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) shall

<<<

 be paid to the Security Agent. Such proceeds shall be applied in the following order:

(i)

First, towards payment of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses incurred by

the Security Agent and the Bond Trustee for the Bonds and the Existing

Bonds

<<<

;

(ii) second, towards the discharge of the Super Senior Obligations; and

(iii) third, towards the discharge of the payment obligations under the finance documents for the Existing Bonds.

The above payment waterfall provisions shall apply

<<<

 equally to any proceeds from

16 of 20

insolvency proceedings in any of the Obligors.
The Intercreditor Agreement shall include provisions for turnover of funds in the event of any creditor receiving payment in conflict with these principles

<<<

 after an Initial Enforcement Notice has been given or action has been initiated to enforce the Security Documents. The Payment waterfall provisions shall apply regardless of any Security Documents not being (for whatever reason) valid or enforceable

<<<

 in respect of the relevant Secured Creditor

Enforcement and standstill:

The Intercreditor Agreement shall contain provisions regulating the rights of each class of secured creditors to vote and instruct the Security Agent to enforce the Security

<<<

 Documents.

1. The Trustee shall, unless an insolvency event has occurred or such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be recovered under the Security, arrange for a telephone conference between the Bondholders

<<<

 and the Existing Bondolders before issuing any enforcement instruction to the Security Agent on behalf of any Secured Creditor Group.

2. Each Secured Creditor Group may deliver an Initial Enforcement Notice and supplementary enforcement instructions

<<<

 to the Security Agent, in accordance with the default provisions of their respective finance documents.

3. The right to issue decisive enforcement instructions shall in the event of conflicting enforcement instructions first go to the Existing

<<<

 Bondholders alone.

4. If (i) enforcement (as further defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has not commenced within 6 months after an initial enforcement notice was duly delivered to the Security Agent on behalf of the Bondholders under

<<<

 the Bond or on behalf of the Existing Bondholders under the Existing Bond (whichever is first) (the "Initial Enforcement Notice") or (ii) all Super Senior Obligations have not been fully discharged within 12 months after the Initial Enforcement

<<<

 Notice, then the right to give decisive enforcement instructions in the event of conflicting instructions shall shift to the Bondholders provided that an event of default under the Bond Agreement has occurred and is continuing (both periods

<<<

 referred to as the "Standstill Periods").

The Security Agent may as a condition for carrying out an instruction to enforce the Security Documents, require (i) satisfactory security and indemnities for any possible liability and anticipated

<<<

 costs and expenses, from the Secured Creditor Class issuing the relevant instruction and (ii) satisfactory documentation on the compliance with the provisions below under "Enforcement".

Each Secured Creditor Class shall cast its vote in any

<<<

 proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any Obligor as instructed by the Security Agent

<<<

 as directed by the Secured Creditor Class with decisive instruction right.

Buy-Out Option:

The Existing Bondholders shall at any time following the Security Agent's notice that it intends to accelerate any Joint Security on behalf of the

<<<

 Bondholders, have the option to purchase all the Bonds from the Bondholders against payment of the Super Senior Obligations. The purchase option shall be effected pro-rata to their holding of Existing Bonds in the event that several Existing

<<<

 Bondholders exercises the Option. The Trustee is authorised by Bondholders to transfer the Bonds in the VPS against settlement as prescribed and may require the Bondholders to execute any statements or

receiver, administrator or similar officer appointed in respect of an

Obligor or the assets of an Obligor (iii) after having conducted a

the Existing Bondholders with minimum 1 month written notice, or iv)

 of the fair marked price as per

a fairness opinion provided by a reputable internationally recognized

investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable,

third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing

under the security to be enforced (a "Financial Advisor").

Information on FSA review

Statement of disclosure as at February 15, 2016 concerning the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway ("Finanstilsynet" or "FSA") review of the financial reporting of General Exploration Partners

<<<

, Inc. ("GEP" or "the Company"):
The FSA has since 2015 reviewed certain aspects of the financial reporting etc. of General Exploration Partners, Inc. in its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, and for the unaudited

<<<

 financial statements for the 9 months ended September 30, 2015 both of which were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS").
A definitive decision has not to date been delivered to GEP by the FSA. Finanstilsynet

<<<

 advised on January 15, 2016 that it is currently working towards sending advance notice of decision in respect of items 1-3 described below, has requested further information in respect of items 4-5 and that "as yet it does not have a full

<<<

 view of the cumulative effects, it has as yet not concluded as to the likely action to take if some or all of the above topics mature to final decisions/conclusions."
The FSA's positions are as follows:
The Atrush intangible exploration and

<<<

 evaluation assets should have been reclassified to property plant and equipment at December 31,2014 in accordance with IFRS 6.17 as the criteria of technical and commercial viability were then demonstrable.
The cash held in GEP's escrow bank

<<<

 accounts and pledged in favor of the bond trustee as at December 31, 2014 should have been presented in a separate balance sheet line item as "Restricted funds" and also split between short term and long term if and as required.
GEP's impairment

<<<

 assessment of exploration and evaluation assets at December 31, 2014 was not based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and it should be recalculated using reasonable assumptions.
The FSA's preliminary assessment is that given the fact

<<<

 pattern deemed correct at the time of filing (that the Kurdistan Regional Government had successfully exercised its option under the Atrush Block Production Sharing Contract to acquire a working interest in the Atrush Block and GEP was consequently

<<<

 holding a 20.1% working interest), the funds advanced by GEP on behalf of the KRG's working interest have should have been accounted for as accounts receivable rather than as intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
The FSA has asked GEP

<<<

 to elaborate further on facts and accounting concerning payments from GEP to Shamaran of in total USD 6 million in 2014 (divided into USD 500,000 per month) by release from escrow account to cover management and administrative costs in the

<<<

 ShaMaran Group.
With respect to IFRS 7 and going concern issues better disclosure should have been given relating to the expected investment and funding requirements to finance phase 1 of the development (stating that the GEP 2014 annual report

<<<

 should have contained some of the statements given by ShaMaran in its February 2015 prospectus).
GEP has been in ongoing discussions with the FSA and its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Switzerland ("PwC"), concerning the above mentioned

<<<

 items. GEP and PwC remain of the view that GEP's audited financial statements as at December 31, 2014 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs in accordance with IFRS. GEP has been fully supporting the review and provided

<<<

 all information as requested. GEP believes that the risk is lowthat the conclusions ultimately reached in the completion of the review would result in the Company being in breach of the relevant covenants under the existing bond agreement.

<<<

<<<

<<<

<<<

<<<

 not existing clients of a Manager will be categorized as non-professional clients unless otherwise is communicated in writing by the relevant Manager. For further information about the categorization the Applicant may contact the Manager. The

<<<

 Manager will treat the application as an execution only instruction from the Applicant to apply for Bonds and hence the Manager will not determine whether the application for Bonds is suitable or not for the Applicant as otherwise provided

<<<

 for in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act. The Manager will receive a consideration from the Company, and will in conducting its work have to take into consideration the requirements of the Company and the interests of the investors subscribing

<<<

<<<

<<<

 a Manager's group may have information that may be relevant to the Applicant, but which a Manager will not have access to in its capacity as Manager for the Bond Issue. The Manager is further part of a securities firm that offers a broad range

<<<

 of investment services. In order to ensure that assignments undertaken in certain departments are kept confidential, the other activities (including analysis and stock broking) are separated from the respective departments by information walls

<<<

<<<
