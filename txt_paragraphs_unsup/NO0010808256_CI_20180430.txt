Notes to the accounts for 2017

Accounting principles
The annual accounts have been prepared in

<<<

 compliance with the Accounting Act and accounting principles generally accepted in Norway.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with the Accounting Act requires the use of estimates. The application of the

<<<

 company's accounting principles also require management to apply assessments. Areas which to a great extent contain such assessments, a high degree of complexity, or areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant for the financial

<<<

 statements, are described in the notes.
Shares in subsidiaries and associated companies Subsidiaries are companies controlled by a parent through the ownership of greater than 50 percent of its voting stock. An associate company is a company

<<<

 in which another company owns a significant portion of voting shares, usually 20-50 percent.
The following companies are included in the Group: Parent and susidiaries HI Bidco AS (parent) Helseinnovasjon AS Melin Medical AS Melin Collectors

<<<

 AS Melin Medical AB Melin Collectors Danmark ApS Melin Medical Danmark ApS
Ownership throughout the group is 100 %
Accounting principles for shares in subsidiaries and associated companies Investments in subsidiaries and associated companies

<<<

 are booked according to the cost method. The cost price increases when facilities gets provided by capital expansion or when subsidiaries receive intra-group contributions. Received contributions are treated in the first place as income. Contributions

<<<

 that exceed the share of retained earnings of purchase are recognized as a reduction of purchase cost. Dividends/intra-group contributions from subsidiaries are accounted for in the same year as the subsidiaries deposits the amount. Dividends

<<<

 from other companies are accounted for as financial income when the dividend are decided.
Consolidation principles Subsidiaries are consolidated when the control is transferred to the Group (acquisition date). In the consolidated financial

<<<

 statement are shares in subsidiaries replaced by the subsidiaries assets and liabilities. The consolidated financial statement are prepared as if the Group was one economic unit. Transactions, unrealized profits and balances with group companies

<<<

 are eliminated.

HI Bidco AS

Notes to the accounts for 2017

Acquired subsidiaries are accounted for in the consolidated financial statement based on the parent's purchase cost. Purchase cost is assigned to identifiable assets and liabilites

<<<

 of the subsidiary, which are listed in the consolidated financial statement at fair value at the acquisition date. Any added value out of what can be attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilites, is capitalized as goodwill. Goodwill

<<<

 is treated as a residual and capitalized with the proportion that is observed in the acquisition transaction. Excess value in the consolidated financial statement are depreciated over the expected life of the acquired assets.
Revenues
Income

<<<

 from sale of goods and services are recognised at fair value of the consideration, net after deduction of VAT, returns, discounts and reductions. Sales are taken to income when the company has delivered its services to the customer and there

<<<

 are no unsatisfied commitments which may influence the customer's acceptance of the services.
The group has adopted the accrued revenue principle where recognition of invoice fee, reminder fee and debt collection fee is based on the expected

<<<

 revenues and resolution rates for the active claims/portfolio of claims. Historical data is applied to estimate and recognise accrued revenue from invoice fee, reminder fee and debt collection fee. The historical data contains resolution rates

<<<

 and expected revenue from different patinet segments where only segment A and B are recognized.
Classification of balance sheet items
Assets intended for long term ownership or use have been classified as fixed assets. Assets relating to the

<<<

 trading cycle have been classified as current assets. Other receivables are classified as current assets if they are to be repaid within one year after the transaction date. Similar criteria apply to liabilities. First year's instalment on

<<<

 long term liabilities and long term receivables are, however, not classified as short term liabilities and current assets.
Purchase costs The purchase cost of assets includes the cost price for the asset, adjusted for bonuses, discounts and

<<<

 other rebates received, and purchase costs (freight, customs fees, public fees which are non-refundable and any other direct purchase costs). Purchases in foreign currencies are reflected in the balance sheet at the exchange rate at the transaction

<<<

 date.
Interest expense incurred in connection with the production of fixed assets is expensed.

Intangible assets
R&D expenses are taken into the balance sheet providing a future financial benefit relating to the development of an identifiable

<<<

 intangible asset can be identified and the expenses can be reliably measured. Otherwise such expenses are expensed as and when incurred. R&D expenses are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the asset's expected useful life.
Fixed assets

<<<

 Land is not depreciated. Other fixed assets are reflected in the balance sheet and depreciated to residual value over the asset's expected useful life on a straight-line basis. If changes in the depreciation plan occur the effect is distributed

<<<

 over the remaining depreciation period. Direct maintenance of an asset is expensed under operating expenses as and when it is incurred. Additions or improvements are added to the asset's cost price and depreciated together with the asset. The

<<<

 split between maintenance and additions/improvements is calculated in proportion to the asset's condition at the acquisition date.

HI Bidco AS

Notes to the accounts for 2017

Leased assets are reflected in the balances sheet as assets if

<<<

 the leasing contract is considered a financial lease.
Investments in other companies
Except for short term investments in listed shares, the cost method is applied to investments in other companies. The cost price is increased when funds are

<<<

 added through capital increases or when group contributions are made to subsidiaries. Dividends received are initially taken to income. Dividends exceeding the portion of retained equity after the purchase are reflected as a reduction in purchase

<<<

 cost. Dividend/group contribution from subsidiaries are reflected in the same year as the subsidiary makes a provision for the amount. Dividend from other companies are reflected as financial income when it has been approved.
Asset impairments

<<<

 Impairment tests are carried out if there is indication that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. The test is performed on the lowest level of fixed assets at which independent cashflows can be identified

<<<

. If the carrying amount is higher than both the fair value less cost to sell and recoverable amount (net present value of future use/ownership), the asset is written down to the highest of fair value less cost to sell and the recoverable amount

<<<

. Previous impairment charges, except writedown of goodwill, are reversed in later periods if the conditions causing the write-down are no longer present.
Debtors Trade debtors are recognised in the balance sheet after provision for bad debts

<<<

. The bad debts provision is made on basis of an individual assessment of each debtor and an additional provision is made for other debtors to cover expected losses. Significant financial problems at the customers, the likelihood that the customer

<<<

 will become bankrupt or experience financial restructuring and postponements and insufficient payments, are considered indicators that the debtors should be written down.
Other debtors, both current and long term, are recognised at the lower

<<<

 of nominal and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the present value of estimated future payments. When the effect of a writedown is insignificant for accounting purposes this is, however, not carried out. Provisions for bad debts

<<<

 are valued the same way as for trade debtors.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses relating to sales and purchases in foreign currencies

<<<

 are recognised as operating income and cost of goods sold.
Liabilities
Liabilities, with the exception of certain liability provisions, are recognised in the balance sheet at nominal amount.
Pensions Defined contribution plan With a defined

<<<

 contribution plan the company pays contributions to an insurance company. After the contribution has been made the company has no further commitment to pay. The contribution is recognised as payroll expenses. Prepaid contributions are reflected

<<<

 as an asset (pension fund) to the degree the contribution can be refunded or will reduce future payments.

HI Bidco AS

Notes to the accounts for 2017

Taxes The tax charge in the income statement includes both payable taxes for the period

<<<

 and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at relevant tax rates on the basis of the temporary differences which exist between accounting and tax values, and any carryforward losses for tax purposes at the year-end. Tax enhancing

<<<

 or tax reducing temporary differences, which are reversed or may be reversed in the same period, have been eliminated. The disclosure of deferred tax benefits on net tax reducing differences which have not been eliminated, and carryforward

<<<

 losses, is based on estimated future earnings. Deferred tax and tax benefits which may be shown in the balance sheet are presented net.
Tax reduction on group contributions given and tax on group contribution received, booked as a reduction

<<<

 of cost price or taken directly to equity, are booked directly against tax in the balance sheet (offset against payable taxes if the group contribution has affected payable taxes, and offset against deferred taxes if the group contribution

<<<

 has affected deferred taxes).
Deferred tax is reflected at nominal value.
Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement has been prepared according to the indirect method. Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits, and other short

<<<

 term investments which immediately and with minimal exchange risk can be converted into known cash amounts, with due date less than three months from purchase date.

 and loss of NOK thousand 41 421 in the financial statements of the group. The financial statements comprise:
· The financial statements of the parent company, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017, and the income statement

 and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, and
· The financial statements of the group, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December

<<<

 2017, and the income statement and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion:
· The financial statements are prepared in accordance

<<<

 with the law and regulations.
· The accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the parent company as at 31 December 2017, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended

<<<

 in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
· The accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group as at 31 December

<<<

 2017, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
Basisfor Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance

<<<

 with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilitiesfor

<<<

 the Audit o f the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group as required by laws and regulations, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements

<<<

. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independent Auditor's Report - HI Bidco AS
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form

<<<

 of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial

<<<

 statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report

<<<

 that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Board ofDirectors and the Managing Directorfor the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the preparation

<<<

 in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for such internal control

<<<

 as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing

<<<

 the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise

<<<

 will cease operations.
Auditor's Responsibilitiesfor the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due

<<<

 to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and

<<<

 practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably

<<<

 be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including

<<<

 ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform

<<<

 audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting

<<<

 from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
(2)

Independent Auditor's Report - HI Bidco AS
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to

<<<

 the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company and the Group's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness of

<<<

 accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence

<<<

 obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company or the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are

<<<

 required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date

<<<

 of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company or the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the

<<<

 disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities

<<<

 or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion

<<<

.
We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit
