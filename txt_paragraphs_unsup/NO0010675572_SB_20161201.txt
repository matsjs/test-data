013/2017"
Oslo, 1 December 2016
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Trustee") for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue with ISIN NO 001 067557.2 (the "Bond Issue

<<<

") issued by Western Bulk Chartering AS (the "Issuer"), who replaced the previous issuer Kistefos Equity Operations AS as issuer pursuant to pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement dated 6 July 2016 (the "Amendment and Restatement

<<<

 Agreement No. 3"), who in turn replaced the original issuer Bulk Invest ASA (formerly Western Bulk ASA) as issuer pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement dated 25 February 2016 (the "Amendment and Restatement Agreement No. 2").
All

<<<

 capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally dated 17 April 2013, as amended (most recently through the Amendment and Restatement Agreement No. 3, made between the Trustee and the Issuer

<<<

 (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. References to Clauses and paragraphs are references to Clauses and paragraphs of the Bond Agreement.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided

<<<

 by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 BACKGROUND
The Company is a global dry bulk operator of Supramax and large Handysize tonnage, and is currently operating 130-14

<<<

0 vessels. The Issuer has been exposed to a very challenging market situation in 2016 with historically low dry bulk charter rates. Net TC margins declined significantly during Ql-16 and into Q2-16. In addition to the soft underlying freight

<<<

 markets, the Issuer incurred both direct and indirect losses from its previous parent company Bulk Invest ASA's (former Western Bulk ASA) bankruptcy. The indirect losses were caused by counterparties being nervous for business interruptions

<<<

 and a general uncertainty relating to Western Bulk Chartering as a consequence of the Company being associated with the Bulk Invest bankruptcy. This led to fewer business opportunities and a period of reduced activity, particularly in the spot

<<<

 market. However, the trend has been positive since end of May '16 for both fleet size and margins, but margins have not improved sufficiently for the Company to be profitable yet.
L 7169111 VI 02.02.16 514964-020

2/6
In June 2016, the Company

<<<

 completed a private placement directed at the largest, former Bulk Invest ASA shareholders, raising about USD 20 million in new equity and moved the Bond Issue from Kistefos Equity Operations AS to the Company. Subsequent to this transaction

<<<

, in August 2016, the Company raised USD 2 million from previous smaller shareholders of Bulk Invest. The Company is now owned by a group of about 250 shareholders. Kistefos AS remains the main shareholder, controlling approximately 74% of the

<<<

 shares through two of its subsidiaries. In June, the Group entered into a new bank facility of USD 8 million, consisting of USD 6 million credit line and USD 2 million available for bank guarantees. The credit line is for general working capital

<<<

 purposes, and is undrawn as of 23.11.2016.
Although the market has strengthened recently and a number of mitigating initiatives are contributing positively to the Group's results, there is still a need to further strengthen the Company's balance

<<<

 sheet and cash position. Consequently, the Company is therefore contemplating an equity issue of the NOK equivalent to USD 15 million before the end of IQ 2017, of which the main two shareholders Kistefos AS and Ojada AS will guarantee the

<<<

 full amount, being approximately the NOK equivalent to USD 13.8 million and USD 1.2 million respectively (altogether the "Equity Issue"). The contemplated Equity Issue will cover the losses expected for 2H-16, and further improve the cash position

<<<

 and balance sheet of the Group. Furthermore, it is expected to pave way for additional market access for both cargo and vessels and will give a general positive effect for the brand and business.
Main mitigating factors and positive developments

<<<

 since June 2016: · Market conditions have improved since 1H-16. · Continuous reliable service provided to its customers - no business interruptions have occurred. · The Company is now doing business with nearly all key customers it did business

<<<

 with before the events in Q.l-16. · Operated fleet and margins have had a positive development: o The fleet is now at 130-140 vessels, and Net TC margin is positive again. o The aim is to return to break-even results as soon as possible. ·

<<<

 New hires have increased the staff to 108 currently: o The Group continues to increase its market presence, and has during Q3-16 seen another 3 persons joining the US Gulf business unit in Miami. In addition, an office in Morocco has been opened

<<<

 to support new business in the West Africa area (1 person relocated from Oslo and 1 new hire). The office is a branch of the South Atlantic Business unit in Oslo. · The restructuring of the Atlantic and Steel&Bulk business units has been completed

<<<

. · Equity to be raised in the Equity Issue: o Cover the losses expected for 2H-16 and further improve the cash position and balance sheet. o Expected to pave way for additional market access for both cargo and vessels. o Give a general positive

<<<

 effect for the brand and business.

3/6
Despite of the equity already raised to date and the mitigating initiatives implemented, the losses incurred through 2016 has lowered to book equity of the Issuer to USD 10.6 million as of Q3 2016. The

<<<

 financial outlook for Q4 2016 suggests the book equity could be lower by year end 2016. From 1 January 2017 the minimum book equity covenant of USD 15 million is coming into effect, leading to a potential covenant breach. In order to be able

<<<

 to attract the new equity, the Company will need to obtain a waiver from its bondholders for the minimum equity covenant throughout 2017 to 1 January 2018. The same waiver has already been granted by the bank providing the USD 6 million credit

<<<

 line. Furthermore, the Company is proposing to amend the reporting requirements from quarterly to semi-annually. This request is coming from a commercial perspective, as the Company experiences some negative attention from certain business

<<<

 partners each time the results are released.
The Company is also proposing to open up for the ability to sell Issuer's Bonds held in treasury. This will only apply for bonds acquired after 31 December 2016, and is being proposed to provide

<<<

 some more financial flexibility if Issuer's bonds are acquired in the future.
Please note that Pareto Securities AS is acting as the Company's financial advisor with respect to the Equity Issue and the Proposal set out herein.
