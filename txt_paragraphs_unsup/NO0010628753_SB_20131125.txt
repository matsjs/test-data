 Issue 2011/2016 ISIN NO 001 064940.3 - FRN Songa Offshore SE Senior Unsecured Bond Issue 2012/2015
1 BACKGROUND AND COMPANY UPDATE
1.1 Operational update
As reported on 11 November 2013, in Q3 2013 the Company's Norwegian Continental Shelf

<<<

 fleet had an operational efficiency of 95% with 94% earnings efficiency. The headline numbers were negatively affected by 12 days of downtime on Songa Trym due to equipment failure. Songa Venus had an operational uptime of 99% and earnings

<<<

 efficiency of 98% in the quarter. Songa Mercur performed mobilization, operational preparation and acceptance testing ahead of the eniVietnam contract and was thus not operational in the quarter.
The construction of the Cat D rigs continues

<<<

 according to the revised schedule communicated in the Q2 report and confirmed in the Q3 report. There is a high confidence level on the delivery schedule for the first two rigs, with percentage completion in the range of 73%-76% as of end October

<<<

 2013. The project team is focused on executing delivery and mobilization as efficiently as possible, in close cooperation with Statoil, in order for drilling operations for Songa Equinox to commence in Q1 2015. The overall "ready to drill"

<<<

 project cost per rig is estimated at USD 660,000,000 plus capitalized interest, including USD 100,000,000 in project management and mobilization costs.
1.2 Financial update Total revenues for Q3 2013 amounted to USD 131.0 million, compared

<<<

 to USD 150.5 million in the Q3 2012. The reduction is mainly due to the disposal of Songa Eclipse and operational preparations of Songa Mercur, partly offset by increased revenue for Songa Delta. EBITDA in the quarter of USD 50.6 million is

<<<

 USD 6.2 million lower than in the same period in 2012, reflecting USD 19.5 million lower revenues, partly offset by USD 13.3 million in lower expenses. At the end of the Q3 2013, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of USD 92.8 million

<<<

. The outstanding debt at the time amounted to USD 1,012.1 million. The firm contract revenue backlog at the end of Q3 2013 was USD 6.6 billion, with another USD 8.4 billion worth of options.
During Q3 2013, Songa signed term sheets for USD

<<<

 1,014 million of debt financing for the first two Cat D rigs, supported by the Norwegian and Korean Export Credit Agencies. The facilities will provide loan availability pre delivery of USD 103 million. As a part of the Company's ongoing efforts

<<<

 to strengthen its balance sheet, Songa shall exercise their best efforts in order for Songa Mercur and Songa Venus to be divested.
1.3 Refinancing plan
Background
The Company has over time faced and continue to face several interlinked financial

<<<

 challenges. The Cat D program represents a transformation of the Company where the goal is to establish a strong North Atlantic harsh environment focused drilling contractor, but it also involves a significant funding exercise. The Company

<<<

 has recently struggled to meet the covenants under its different loan arrangements whilst working towards forming a solid platform for raising the new capital to the Company. During this period all stakeholders of the Company have bom significant

<<<

 risk and seen their assets be repriced as the capital markets have put increased focus on the significant funding need of the Company. With remaining capital expenditures of about USD 2,200 million until delivery of the fourth CAT D rig on

<<<

 top of loan and bond maturities the Company has to date not found a way to solve these issues.
hi order to fully finance and facilitate a successful delivery of the CAT D rigs as well as creating a solid long tenn financial platform for the

<<<

 Company in the best interest of all stakeholders, the Board o f Directors of the Company has today announced a comprehensive refinancing plan (the "Refinancing Plan"), which,

if approved and implemented, will represent a solution to the challenging

<<<

 financial situation and ensure a long term sustainable financial platform.
Summary o f the Refinancing Plan
In summary, the announced Refinancing Plan comprises the following main interdependent elements:
(a) Raising minimum USD 400 million

<<<

 in new risk capital, consisting o f a minimum USD 250 million equity issue and up to USD 150 million subordinated convertible bond, pre-committed by the largest existing shareholder.
The Refinancing Proposal is being launched in combination

<<<

 with (i) launch of an equity issue through a private placement in the amount of minimum USD 250 million (the "Private Placement") and a subsequent repair offering in an amount expected to be up to USD 25 million (the "Subsequent Offering")

<<<

 (together the "Equity Issue") and (ii) launch of a subordinated convertible bond in the amount of up to USD 150 million (the "Subordinated Convertible Bond").
Completion o f the Equity Issue and issuance of the Subordinated Convertible Bond

<<<

 is subject to inter alia successful placing, due approval thereof by an extraordinary general meeting of the Company expected to be held on or about 17 December 2013, required resolutions in favour of the Refinancing Proposal to be made by

<<<

 the Bondholders for the Bond Issues, final agreements and executed documentation related to the Cat D Amendments and the Bank Debt Amendments.
The Company's largest shareholder Perestroika AS has guaranteed the subscription of USD 250 million

<<<

 in the Equity Issue (and has required to be allocated shares resulting in a post transaction ownership of at least 50.1% including any ownership stake in the Subordinated Convertible Bond).
(b) Amending the existingfleetfacility
As part o f

<<<

 the Refinancing Plan, the Issuer will request certain amendments to its bank debt. The quarterly amortization will be reduced by 50%, the maturity date extended by 1 year until Q4 2016 and the Mandatory prepayment if Sale of Vessels reduced

<<<

 from 120% of the mortgage amount to 50% of the mortgage amount for each of Songa Venus and Songa Mercur, as well as amendments to certain covenants, including without limitation the equity ratio covenant (the "Bank Debt Amendments").
(c) CAT

<<<

-D contracts - improved terms
As part o f the Refinancing Plan, the Issuer has proposed certain amendments to the existing charter agreements with Statoil ASA and Statoil Petroleum AS ("Statoil") as charterers of the CAT D rigs. Among other

<<<

 adjustments, the new proposed terms include inter alia (i) a 5% average rate increase for the CAT D units during the fixed contract period in a declining rate profile from 9.0% the first full year to 0.0% in year 8, partly offset by a repayment

<<<

 to Statoil of USD 12,500,000 per rig upon Statoil's declaration of each of the two initial three-year option periods (i.e. an aggregate repayment of up to USD 50,000,000 in 2023 and up to USD 50,000,000 in 2026). The Issuer has also proposed

<<<

 certain amendments to ensure increasing bankability of certain variable rate components and to cancel the purchase options at the end of the fixed contract period for CAT-D-1 and CAT-D-2. The above amendments are subject to approval by Statoil

<<<

 and the respective licence partners. As part of the Refinancing Plan, the loan of USD 222,000,000 from Statoil, which were provided to the Issuer in order to pre-fund the first installment for CAT-D-3 and CAT-D-4 shall be repaid in the amount

<<<

 of USD 111,000,000 upon settlement of the Equity Issue, and the remaining balance shall be repaid equally upon delivery of CAT-D-1 and CAT-D-2 from the yard.(such amendments referred to as the "CAT D Amendments").
(d) Amend the Bond Agreements

<<<

 including extended maturity, adjusted coupon and amendments to certainfinancial covenants.

As an integral part of the Refinancing Plan the Issuer is requesting certain amendments to and waivers from the Bond Agreements, i.e. the Proposal

<<<

 as defined in and the summons letter dated 25 November 2013 (and the schedules thereto). As follows, the Proposal i.a. include amendment of interest rate levels (and conversion from floating to fixed rates), maturity extensions and covenant

<<<

 change.
hi addition to the above, the Company will use its best efforts continue its efforts to complete a sale of Songa Venus and Songa Mercur, and thus focusing all its operations in the North Atlantic harsh environment. Such sales are, however

<<<

, not a condition for the Refinancing Plan. For a more detailed description of the Refinancing Plan, please see the Company presentation attached to the Company's announcement regarding the refinancing on 25 November 2013, available under the

<<<

<<<

 of the Issuer has extended or authorised such extensions, until the tenth (10) Banicing Day prior to the Maturity Date (the "Conversion Prolongation").

The Issuer shall ensure that a shareholders' meeting is held to approve the Conversion

<<<

 Prolongation, such shareholder's meeting to be held after the date falling 4 years and 11 months prior to the Maturity Date, but before 4 years and 9 months prior to the Maturity Date. The Company's largest shareholder, Perestroika AS, has

<<<


c) making or procuring payment to the relevant Bondholders in cash of any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Bonds on the Maturity Date

<<<

 for the fifteen consecutive trading days commencing three (3) trading days

4

25 November 2013
