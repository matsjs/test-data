The proposal was adopted according to the voting requirements of the Loan Agreement and the Bond Agreement will therefore be changed as follows:

Increase of First Priority Security

The company proposes an increase of the carve-out of the

<<<

 First Priority Security from USD 215 million to USD 450 million to reflect the opportunities seen from the banks on back of the employment contract entered into with Petrobras.

Removal of amortization of the First Priority Security and the

 debt secured thereby

Due to the somewhat later delivery of MPF-01 than the initial schedule (new Delivery Date of the Drillship is expected no later than 4Q 2009), and due to the current uncertainty of the level of the expected senior facility

<<<

 and its amortization profile, the Company proposes to remove the amortization schedule of the First Priority Security and the debt secured thereby.

Bullet structure

To reflect the somewhat later delivery than the initial schedule, the Company

<<<



would also propose a waiver for removing the sinking funds under the Loan,

i.e. the Loan shall be a bullet bond issue.
