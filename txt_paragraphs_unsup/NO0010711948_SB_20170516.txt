BACKGROUND

Reference is made to the Bondholders' Meeting held on 30 September

2016 pursuant to which the Bondholders, for the period to and including 30 June 2017, temporarily waived the financial covenants set out in Clause 13.7 (a) (Equity Ratio) of the Bond Agreement (the "Equity Covenant") and where the requirement

<<<

 to maintain a minimum Liquidity set out in Clause 13.7 (b) {Liquidity) of the Bond Agreement (the "Liquidity Covenant") was reduced from USD 10,000,000 to USD 7,000,000.

The Issuer has continued to monitor the financial covenants in the Bond

<<<

 Agreement which continue to be impacted by inter alia the prevailing oil price, and the Group's current forecasts project continuing non-compliance with the Equity Covenant and the Liquidity Covenant. To this end, the Issuer has concluded that

<<<

 it is likely that the Issuer will be in breach of the Equity Covenant and the Liquidity Covenant for the remainder of the year ending 31 December 2017.

Furthermore, pursuant to Clause 10.1 {Maturity and instalments) of the Bond Agreement the

<<<

 Issuer is required to repay the Bonds in instalments due on the Interest Payment Dates in June 2017 and December 2017 in the amount of USD 6,000,000, respectively. Due to the low commodity price environment the Issuer will face challenges with

<<<

 the amortization of the Bonds on the said Interest Payment Dates.
