2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation--The accompanying consolidated financial statements

<<<

 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). All amounts are stated in United States (U.S.) dollars.

Principles of Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements

<<<

 include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all subsidiaries of the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and balances with consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation.

Management Estimates--The preparation

<<<

 of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at

<<<

 the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that

<<<

 the Company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.

-7-

Revenue and Expense Recognition--Since

<<<

 inception, the Company has generated its revenues from both spot market exposed arrangements and fixed-rate charter agreements. The Company's strategy has generally been to remain exposed to the spot market by participating in pooling arrangements

<<<

 with its vessels. Certain vessels were purchased with expiring short term charters, and were added to pools on the expiration of those charters.
Under the Company's pooling arrangements, the costs of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the

<<<

 pools, while operating costs including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel. Since the members of the pools share in the revenue less voyage expenses generated by the entire group of vessels in the

<<<

 pool, the revenue earned by these vessels is subject to the fluctuation of the spot market. The Company recognizes revenue from these pool arrangements based on its portion of the net distributable income reported by the relevant pool, which

<<<

 represents the net voyage revenue of the pool after voyage expenses and pool manager fees.
All revenues from voyage charters are recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the relative transit time in each period. The Company does not begin recognizing

<<<

 revenue until a charter has been agreed to by the customer and the Company. Vessels that operate under fixed rate time charters receive monthly payments at a fixed rate. The Company recognizes this revenue in the month it is earned.
Voyage

<<<

 expenses associated with charter revenue represent all expenses related to particular voyages, including bunker fuel expenses, port fees, cargo loading and unloading expenses, canal tolls, agency fees and commissions. Vessel operating expenses

<<<

 associated with pool revenue and charter revenue include crewing, repairs and maintenance, insurance, stores, lube oils and communication expenses. Voyage expenses and vessel operating expenses are recognized when incurred.
Cash--Cash and Cash

<<<

 Equivalents includes cash on hand and in banks, as well as highly liquid investments such as money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.
Accounts Receivable--Accounts receivable represents trade

<<<

 amounts owed to the Company from vessel earnings and do not bear interest. At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses the potential credit loss and risk of collectability on these receivables and has determined it to be minimal. If amounts

<<<

 become uncollectible, a reserve will be established in the Company's consolidated statements of operations when that determination is made. For the year ended December 31, 2014 and the period from March 26, 2013 (date of inception) to December

<<<

 31, 2013, the Company did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Inventory--Inventory, which is comprised primarily of lubricants, is recorded at cost. Cost is determined using the FIFO method.
Vessels and Equipment--The acquisition

<<<

 cost and all costs incurred to restore used vessels purchased by the Company to the standard required to properly service the Company's customers are capitalized. Vessel capital modifications include the addition of new equipment or can encompass

<<<

 various modifications to the vessel which are aimed at improving or increasing the operational efficiency and functionality of the asset. This type of expenditure is capitalized and generally depreciated over the remaining useful life of the

<<<

 vessel.
Vessel depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over a vessel's estimated useful life, less an estimated residual value. For vessels, the Company uses an estimated useful life of 25 years from the vessel's original build

<<<

 date. The Company estimates residual value based on the lightweight tonnage of each vessel multiplied by the average scrap value per lightweight ton of $250 per ton.
-8-

Generally the Company drydocks each vessel every two and a half to five

<<<

 years. The Company defers a substantial portion of the costs incurred during a drydocking and amortizes those costs on a straight- line basis from the completion of a drydocking or intermediate survey to the estimated completion of the next

<<<

 drydocking. The Company includes in deferred drydocking those costs incurred as part of the drydock to meet classification and regulatory requirements. Such costs include expenses relating to the dock preparation and port charges at the drydock

<<<

 facility, expenses relating to hull inspections, external surfaces for pressure cleaning, scraping and bottom painting, expenses relating to machinery and engines of the vessel, and safety equipment on board. Costs that are considered normal

<<<

 repair and maintenance costs, such as routine replacement of parts, crew and fuel costs incurred at the drydock, and system overhauls; generator, boiler, refrigeration and repairs, whether incurred as part of the dry docking or not, are expensed

<<<

 as incurred. When significant drydocking expenditures occur prior to the expiration of the original amortization period, the remaining unamortized balance of the original drydocking cost is expensed.
Long-Lived Assets--The Company reviews the

<<<

 recoverability of its long-lived assets and intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. This assessment is made at the individual vessel level since

<<<

 separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available. Evaluation of possible impairment is based on the Company's ability to recover the asset from the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges

<<<

) of the related operations. If the expected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value.
Depreciation and

<<<

 Amortization--Office furniture and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, typically between 5 and 7 years. For vessels and deferred drydock expenses, see the discussion under Vessels and Equipment

<<<

, above.
Taxes--The Company believes that it and its subsidiaries are not subject to taxation on its income under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The subsidiaries of the Company are subject to registration and tonnage taxes

<<<

 in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which taxes are recorded within `Vessel operating expenses' in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Ridgebury Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is subject to U.S

<<<

. federal tax at a rate of four percent on the U.S. source gross transportation income of its subsidiaries derived from voyages that begin or end in the United States. The Company has recognized an expense of $417,770 in the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2014, which taxes are recorded within `Vessel operating expenses' in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. No voyages began or ended in the U.S. during the period ended December 31, 2013, and the Company therefore recorded

<<<

 no tax expense in 2013. The Company may also be subject to U.S. federal tax on the gains it derives from the sales of its vessels.
Deferred Financing Costs--Costs including bank fees, commissions, and legal expenses associated with securing

<<<

 the Term Loans and Senior Secured Bonds are deferred and amortized over the maturity of the related debt. Amortization of deferred financing costs is included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest

<<<

 method as part of `Interest expense and financing costs'.
Share-Based Compensation--Share-based compensation represents the cost related to share-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors. The Company measures share-based

<<<

 compensation cost at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognizes the cost on an accelerated basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the grantee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting

<<<

 period of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Key assumptions used in estimating the fair value
-9-

of options are dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest

<<<

 rate and expected term. Share-based compensation expense is recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 7, Members' Equity and Incentive Units for additional information

<<<

 on share-based compensation.
Concentration of Credit Risk--The Company, from time to time, has cash in financial institutions in excess of insured limits. In assessing its risk, the Company's policy is to maintain funds only with highly rated

<<<

 financial institutions. Amounts held in excess of FDIC insured limits is $27,445,849 as of December 31, 2014.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, 52% and 28%, respectively, of the Company's revenues were earned under the Company's pooling

<<<

 arrangements with Heidmar Blue Fin Pool and with Norient Product Pool. At December 31, 2014, 47% and 48%, respectively, of Accounts receivable related to receivables from the Heidmar Blue Fin Pool and from the Norient Product Pool. As a result

<<<

 of the timing of vessel purchases and initial voyages of newly acquired vessels, 93% of the revenue for the period from March 26, 2013 (date of inception) to December 31, 2013, was associated with one customer. At December 31, 2013, 90% of

<<<

 the Accounts receivable related to the same customer.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments--The Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, account payable

<<<

, and accrued expenses are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The carrying value of the Company's debt approximates fair value.
Derivatives--The Company utilizes

<<<

 derivative contracts in the form of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk arising from debt that has variable interest rates. The Company recognizes interest rate swaps at fair value in `Accounts payable and accrued liabilities'

<<<

 in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value are recorded in `Interest expense and financing costs' in the consolidated statements of operations.
Reclassification--Certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform with

<<<

 the current year presentation.
Restatement of Prior Period--Subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 and the period from March 26, 2013 (date of inception) to December 31, 2013, the Company

<<<

 determined that certain cash balances should have been disclosed as restricted cash in accordance with the Term Loan agreement. Therefore, the Company reclassified $5,752,125 from cash to non-current restricted cash as of December 31, 2013

<<<

 to properly present such amount.

5. DEBT

<<<



Term Loan--On November 21, 2013, Ridgebury Tankers LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with several financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provided for term loans in the maximum

<<<

 aggregate amount of $105,175,000 ("Term Loans") to be borrowed in tranches specifically related to vessel purchases as they occurred. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $73,521,842 and $85,042,500, respectively, outstanding under

<<<

 this agreement.
The proceeds of the Term Loans were used in conjunction with the acquisition of the Medium Range tankers and the Ridgebury Lessley B listed in the table of vessel-owning companies in Note 1. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement

<<<

 are collateralized by mortgages on the Medium Range tankers and are guaranteed by the Company. As is further described below, the Term Loan that related to the Ridgebury Lessley B was repaid in March 2014 in conjunction with the closing on

<<<

 the Senior Secured Bonds, and the mortgage on the Ridgebury Lessley B was released from the Credit Agreement at that time.

- 11 -

The remaining Term Loans in the aggregate amount of $73,521,842 are payable in quarterly installments that

<<<
