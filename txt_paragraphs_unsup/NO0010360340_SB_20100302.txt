 FRN Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012. ISIN NO 001 036034.0
Oslo, 2 March 2010
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING
1. INTRODUCTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee

<<<

 for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001 036034.0 (the "Loan") issued by Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited ("Remedial").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have

<<<

 the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement governing the Bonds dated 23 March 2007 between Remedial and the Loan Trustee (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated in this summons.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Proposed Restructuring
As Bondholders

<<<

 will be aware, an extraordinary general meeting of Remedial's shareholders was held on 14 December 2009 (the "EGM") to approve resolutions to implement a proposal for a restructuring o f Remedial (the "Restructuring Proposal"). The key terms

<<<

 of the proposal were a debt for equity swap where all of the indebtedness under the Bonds (other than US$56.5 million) would be exchanged on a pro rata basis for new shares representing 95% of Remedial's post-restructuring share capital, with

<<<

 the remaining 5% of the shares to be retained by the current shareholders, and the residual US$56.5 million of bond proceeds to be made available to Remedial's cash flow. The EGM approved these resolutions, but certain of the resolutions authorising

<<<

 the issuance of the shares pursuant to the Restructuring Proposal were to expire on 14 February 2010.
At Remedial's request, the Loan Trustee convened a Bondholders' meeting on 12 February 2010 to approve the Restructuring Proposal and, if

<<<

 the Restructuring Proposal could not be implemented, then the provision of funding to Remedial to facilitate an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs. Those resolutions were passed at the Bondholders' meeting on 12 February 2010. A copy

<<<

 of the summons for that Bondholders' meeting (excluding the enclosures thereto) is attached at Appendix A to this summons.
The resolutions of the Bondholders' meeting to approve the Restructuring Proposal were conditional upon the compromise

<<<

, for no more than US$1.5 million, of two significant

unsecured claims. The first of these was a claim by Swedbank AB (publ) ("Swedbank") of approximately US$7.2 million relating to the termination of three interest

<<<

 rate swap confirmations , and the second was a claim from SEB Enskilda AB ("SEB") of up to US$2.6 million in relation to a financial advisory engagement. Agreement could not be reached with Swedbank and SEB and, as a result, the Restructuring

<<<

 Proposal could not be implemented.
2.2 Commencement o f Chapter 11 Proceedings
Consequently, the board of Remedial concluded that the best means of effecting an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs and maximising value on the realisation

<<<

 of its assets would be the commencement of chapter 11 proceedings in the United States where Remedial has both business operations and significant assets.
The possibility of chapter 11 proceedings had been contemplated as one of the alternatives

<<<

 if the Restructuring Proposal could not be implemented, and the Bondholders' meeting held on 12 February 2010 authorised the Loan Trustee to provide up to US$250,000 from the account in the name of the Loan Trustee in which the remaining bond

<<<

 proceeds are held (the "NTM Account") to meet the costs and expenses of legal advisers engaged by Remedial for the purpose of chapter 11 proceedings. Such amount was advanced by the Loan Trustee for payment to Lowenstein Sandler PC ("Lowenstein

<<<

"), Remedial's US bankruptcy counsel, on 12 February 2010. These funds were advanced under the terms of the existing Loan Agreement and were secured by the security provided over certain OFE engines and rack and chord leg material in relation

<<<

 to the partial release of US$3 million from the NTM Account approved at a Bondholders' meeting held on 11 December 2009.
On 14 February 2010, the board of Remedial resolved to petition for relief under chapter 11 (the "Chapter 11 Proceedings

<<<

") of title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "US Bankruptcy Code"). That petition was filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "US Bankruptcy Court") on 18 February 2010. The intention

<<<

 was that the Chapter 11 Proceedings would be used to facilitate a controlled sale of the Company's assets through a sale procedure under section 363 of the US Bankruptcy Code (a "363 Sale").
2.3 DIP Loan
The Bondholders' meeting held on 12

<<<

 February 2010 also authorised the Loan Trustee to provide funding from the NTM Account for the period following the filing of the petition commencing the Chapter 11 Proceedings in the form of a super priority debtor-in-possession loan (subject

<<<

 to approval of the US Bankruptcy Court) (the "DIP Loan"). The resolution passed at the Bondholders' meeting required Remedial to provide, as security for the DIP Loan, inter alia, a super senior lien and adequate protection collateral over

<<<

 all of Remedial's unencumbered assets. In addition, the resolution required that the amount of the DIP Loan would not exceed US$5 million without further approval of the Bondholders and could only be used to cover Remedial's own legal costs

<<<

, the legal costs of any unsecured creditors' committee, the running costs of Remedial during the Chapter 11 Proceedings and the costs and expenses of, Bingham McCutchen LLP ("Bingham") and AMA Capital Partners LLC ("AMA", and together with

<<<

 Bingham, the "Advisers"), the legal and financial advisers engaged by the Loan Trustee on behalf o f the Bondholders.
The terms o f the DIP Loan were negotiated between Remedial and the Loan Trustee (through their respective advisers), subject

<<<

 to the approval of the US Bankruptcy Court. Following commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceedings, Remedial filed a motion requesting interim approval of a portion of the DIP Loan. An interim court order approving that motion (subject
2

N

<<<

 O R SK TIL L IT SM A N N ASA
www.trustee.no
to some revisions required by the US Bankruptcy Court) was entered on 22 February 2010 (the "Interim Order"). Under the Interim Order, Remedial is authorized to draw US$1.5 million. Subject to the

<<<

 entry of a final order approving the DIP Loan, which typically would be entered by the US Bankruptcy Court within three to four weeks after the commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceedings, Remedial will be eligible for additional draws under

<<<

 the DIP Loan, for an aggregate amount of up to US$5 million. Bondholders can obtain a copy of the DIP Loan (which is secured over all of Remedial's unencumbered assets) by contacting Chetna Mistry at Bingham (tel: +44 20 7661 5409; email: chetna

<<<

.mistry@bingham.com).
3. THE 363 SALE - OFFER AND IMPLEMENTATION
Prior to commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceedings, the Loan Trustee and the Advisers held discussions with an ad hoc committee of Bondholders holding approximately 75% of the

<<<

 Bonds (the "Committee"). The discussion centred around the possibility of the Bondholders bidding for Remedial's assets in a 363 Sale through a credit-bid of the debt represented by the DIP Loan and the Bonds. This approach is not uncommon

<<<

 for secured creditors in US Bankruptcy Proceedings. The bid would initially be made at a level of approximately US$120 million, although there would be an auction process to allow third party bidders to make higher and better offers, and the

<<<

 Bondholders' bid could always be increased at the auction if required. This suggested approach received positive feedback from the Committee.
Based on this feedback, as is described below, the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) will

<<<

 make an offer to Remedial for the Bondholders to purchase substantially all of Remedial's assets, subject to approval by the requisite amount of Bondholders at a Bondholders' meeting. The purpose of this summons, in general terms, is to provide

<<<

 approval of the Loan Trustee's offer, and to approve various other steps required to implement the sale should the Bondholders be the successful bidder.
3.1 363 Sale
Under section 363 of the US Bankruptcy Code, a company which has entered into

<<<

 chapter 11 proceedings is entitled to schedule an auction and sale of all or substantially all of its business and assets in order to maximise recoveries through a 363 Sale. On 26 February 2010, Remedial filed a motion (the "Bidding Procedures

<<<

 Motion") with the US Bankruptcy Court for orders authorising it to sell substantially all of its assets (the "Assets") to a nominee of the Bondholders, subject to higher and better offers. In summary, the Bidding Procedures Motion requests

<<<

 an expedited sale process and marketing activities including an auction sale process to be held in the week beginning 12 April 2010. The Bidding Procedures Motion is currently scheduled to be heard by the US Bankruptcy Court on 10 March 20

<<<

10. Bondholders can obtain a copy o f the Bidding Procedures Motion by contacting Chetna Mistry at Bingham (tel: +44 20 7661 5409; email: chetna.mistry@bingham.com).
Parties wishing to bid on the Assets must meet certain requirements which are

<<<

 described in detail in the Bidding Procedures Motion (including that they must be cash bids). If qualifying bids are received, an auction will be held. The auction will continue until there is only one offer that Remedial determines, after

<<<

 consultation with its unsecured creditors' committee (if one is appointed)1and subject to US Bankruptcy Court approval, is the highest and best offer submitted at the auction (the "Successful Bid"). Remedial requires that a bidder complete

<<<

 and execute all agreements, contracts, instruments and other documents evidencing and
1The US Trustee has not appointed an unsecured creditors' committee to date due to insufficient interest from potential members.
3

N O R SK T ILLITSM A

<<<

 N N ASA
www.trustee.no
containing the terms and conditions upon which the Successful Bid was made within ten days after the close of the auction. A hearing of the US Bankruptcy Court will be scheduled in due course to approve the sale of the

<<<

 Assets, and the prevailing bidder.
3.2 Stalking Horse Bid
The Loan Trustee's offer for the Bondholders to purchase the Assets will be based on funding through a credit bid. The Loan Trustee would make an offer for the Bondholders to buy the

<<<

 Assets as a stalking horse bidder pursuant to section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Stalking Horse Bid").
The purchase on behalf of the Bondholders would be through a newly formed entity ("Newco") as the Bondholders' effective nominee

<<<

. The Stalking Horse Bid will be conditional upon requisite approval of the resolutions tabled at this Bondholders' meeting.
The consideration to be provided by the Bondholders (through Newco) for substantially all of the assets of Remedial

<<<

 under the Stalking Horse Bid is forgiveness of $120 million of debt owed by Remedial to the Bondholders, comprised of (i) all amounts outstanding under the DIP Loan at the time of completion of the 363 Sale to Newco (together with accrued interest

<<<

 thereon) (the "Total DIP Amount"), and (ii) an amount equivalent to $120 million of the Loan under the Loan Agreement, less the Total DIP Amount.
It is proposed that the Loan Trustee be entitled (in consultation with the Advisers) to increase

<<<

 the amount of the Stalking Horse Bid to an amount which is equivalent to the total amount of the Bondholders' claim against Remedial under the Bonds plus the Total DIP Amount.
3.3 Newco; transfer o f the Bonds and all other claims under the

<<<

 Loan Agreement (together, the "Claims") and the DIP Loan to Newco
As indicated, in order for the Bondholders to purchase Remedial's assets, this will require the Loan Trustee to form a new entity, Newco, to be owned by the Bondholders, to purchase

<<<

 and house the purchased assets.
It is anticipated that Newco will be a newly incorporated private company under the laws of the Cayman Islands (or such other jurisdiction as is deemed appropriate by the Loan Trustee, in consultation with the

<<<

 Advisors). Newco will in turn likely incorporate two new subsidiaries "N l" and "N2" (together, the "Subsidiaries") under the laws of an appropriate jurisdiction (again, most likely the Cayman Islands).
In the event that the Stalking Horse

<<<

 Bid is the Successful Bid, Remedial currently expects that the construction contract and all other interests related to ESV1 will reside in N l; and the construction contract and other interests related to ESV2 will reside in N2.
In order for

<<<

 Newco to be able to consummate the Stalking Horse Bid, it will need to be the sole Bondholder under the Loan at the time of completion of the 363 Sale. Accordingly, it is proposed that this Bondholders' meeting resolve to transfer all of the

<<<

 Claims and the DIP Loan to Newco in the event that the Stalking Horse Bid is approved as the Successful Bid, and prior to completion of the 363 Sale. This means that Newco would also become the recipient of the remaining funds from the Escrow

<<<

 Account which are currently held by the Loan Trustee, which (absent any further DIP Loans being made by Bondholders) would be approximately US$48.5 million.
4

^ ^ 6 . . N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
www.lru,steo.no
In the event that there

<<<

 are outstanding defaults under the terms of any contracts which are to transferred to Newco, an amount may need to be paid in cash to the counterparty to cure those defaults, unless otherwise agreed with that counterparty. Such payments by

<<<

 Newco would be funded out of the remaining proceeds of issuance of the Bonds which are currently held in account of the Loan Trustee.
In consideration of the transfer of the Claims and the DIP Loan to Newco, the entire share capital of Newco

<<<

 would be issued to the Bondholders pro rata to their holding of Claims as at the date of completion of that transfer. Accordingly, the Bondholders would become the shareholders of Newco which would be the new holding company of substantially

<<<

 all of Remedial's assets upon completion of the 363 Sale. It is hoped that the shares issued in consideration for the transfer of the Claims can be issued to a nominee, to allow the shares to be traded through the YPS, and to appear in the

<<<

 Bondholders' VPS accounts. Otherwise, a mechanism will need to be put in place for the shares to be registered in the names of individual Bondholders. The Loan Trustee will circulate further information on this in due course. Depending upon

<<<

 the jurisdiction in which Newco is incorporated, it may be necessary for the Bondholders to pay a nominal cash subscription for the shares in Newco in order to receive those shares which could potentially be funded with the monies held in the

<<<

 NTM Account.
It is anticipated that Newco will be established with standard form articles of association for a private company, with ordinary resolutions being approved by a simple majority of shareholders voting, and extraordinary or special

<<<

 resolutions being approved by 66.55% of shareholders voting (unless statute requires a higher amount, such as 75%). It will be open to the shareholders of Newco (i.e. the former Bondholders) to subsequently amend Newco's articles.
The Loan

<<<

 Trustee will work with the Advisers, who shall be instructed to consult with the Committee, to finalise the form of Newco's articles of association, and to identify suitable individuals to be the directors of Newco.
3.4 Newco Loan
In consideration

<<<

 for the transfer to it of the Claims, in addition to issuing the shares in Newco to Bondholders, NewCo shall enter into a new bond loan agreement to issue new bonds to the Bondholders pro rata to their holdings of the Claims. This will be for

<<<

 an amount which is at least equivalent to the to the funds so released to it from the NTM Account, currently estimated to be US$48.5 million (the "Newco Loan").
The form of the agreement governing the Newco Loan will be substantially in the

<<<

 form of the Residual Bond Loan Agreement appended to, and as defined in, the summons to the Bondholders' meeting held on 12 February 2010, provided that it may be updated to be in the Loan Trustee's current standard form. The Loan Trustee may

<<<

 agree changes to the Residual Bond Loan Agreement in consultation with, and based on feedback from, the Committee and the Advisors, taking into account that, following the completion of the 363 Sale to Newco, the Bondholders in the Newco Loan

<<<

 will also be Newco's shareholders) (the "Newco Loan Agreement").
However, on any basis the Newco Loan Agreement will provide for, inter alia, interest on the Newco Loan to accrue at a rate of at least 10.00% per annum. Interest will be capitalised

<<<

 and added to the principal amount of the Newco Loan until the first interest payment date falling at least 30 days after the commencement date of the charter of either of the Vessels.
5

N O RSK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
www.misii'iMio
Following

<<<

 the charter of either of the Vessels, interest will be payable in cash. The Interest Payment Dates will remain the same as under the current Bond Loan Agreement.
The Subsidiaries shall provide security over the Construction Contracts which

<<<

 shall at least be the same as the existing Loan Security, and a mortgage over the Vessels upon completion, in each case in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (in consultation with the Advisers). In addition, Newco and the Subsidiaries

<<<

 will provide a floating charge in favour of the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders in the Newco Loan) over all their business and assets.
The Newco Loan Agreement shall permit the granting of first priority mortgages in favour of the

<<<

 Yards (or their affiliates or third parties) of up to US$7 million with respect to each of the ESVs, with respect to any deferred instalments due to the Yards or other form of delivery financing, and the Loan Trustee shall seek a right for

<<<

 Bondholders to have a direct right to repay those amounts . The Yards (or other financiers) will also be asked to provide written consent to the granting of the security in favour of the Loan Trustee and the transfer of the Construction Contracts

<<<

 to the Subsidiaries. Cosco entered into an agreement on 11 February 2010 with the Loan Trustee to this effect. The Loan Trustee will be entitled to waive these requirements consultation with the Advisors.
The Newco Loan Agreement shall also

<<<

 allow for an additional debt facility of US$20 million to be secured against the Vessels ranking pari passu with the Newco Loan.
3.5 Completion o f Stalking Horse Bid
The resolutions tabled at this Bondholders' meeting will, in practice, only

<<<

 be applicable if the Stalking Horse Bid is the Successful Bid, and the 363 Sale pursuant to the Stalking Horse Bid is subsequently approved by the US Bankruptcy Court. Following such approval, the Loan Trustee would immediately arrange for

<<<

 the transfer of all of the Bonds and the DIP Loan to Newco, in consideration for the issue of shares in Newco and of the Newco Loan to the Bondholders pro rata to their holding of Bonds. This process will need to occur within the period between

<<<

 the Stalking Horse Bid being approved as the Successful Bid, and closing of the 363 Sale (such period to be at least 10 days unless otherwise agreed by the Loan Trustee).

4. EVALUATION

Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the

<<<

 Bondholders by any of the Loan Trustee, AMA, or Bingham. Bondholders should independently evaluate the Stalking Horse Bid and vote accordingly.

RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL - SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING
1. INTRODUCTION
Norsk

<<<

 Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001 036034.0 (the "Loan") issued by Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited

<<<

 ("Remedial").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement governing the Bonds dated 23 March, 2007 between Remedial and the Loan Trustee (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated in

<<<

 this summons.

2. BACKGROUND
On 27 July, Remedial announced that it expected to initiate a restructuring of its current financial position or would require the injection of additional capital before the end of 2009. Remedial further announced

<<<

 on 18 September 2009 that its free cash position would be at a critically low level by the end of September 2009. At the end of November 2009, the cash position of Remedial was US$ 0.3 million in free cash and US$56,5 million of blocked funds

<<<

 in the Escrow Account for the Bonds.
The hinds in the Escrow Account were blocked because there was a continuing Event of Default in existence under the terms of the Loan Agreement, as a consequence of Remedial's failure to make an interest

<<<

 payment on the Bonds on 28 September 2009.
On 18 September 2009, Remedial had requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to seek amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement, including the deferral of interest. On 1 October

<<<

 2009, upon a request from the Loan Trustee, Remedial agreed to defer the call for a Bondholders' meeting to permit Bondholders to consider and respond to Remedial's proposed amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement. In order to assist

<<<

 with the consideration of such proposals, the Loan Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders, engaged independent advisors, AMA Capital Partners LLC ("AMA") and Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham") (together the "Advisors") to perform due

<<<

 diligence on Remedial and give advice on the Bondholders' position and the proposed amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement. The Advisors' engagement is supported by more than 50% of the Bondholders. The Advisors have been in direct contact

<<<

 with an ad hoc committee of Bondholders holding approximately 60% of the outstanding Bonds (the "Committee").

N O R SK TILLITSM A N N ASA
www.lrusrce.no
Since that time the Advisors have undertaken due diligence on Remedial, and have held numerous discussions and meetings

<<<

 with Remedial's management and advisers. These discussions have centred around how to address Remedial's significant liquidity shortfall. In particular, Remedial had requested that Bondholders defer interest payable on the Bonds, and release

<<<

 all escrowed funds to Remedial by way of working capital. In turn, Cosco (Nantong) Shipyard Ltd ("Cosco") and Yantai Raffles Shipyard Ltd ("Yantai") which are building the Vessels (the "Yards"), would (unless otherwise agreed by the Loan Trustee

<<<

 in consultation with the Advisors) each be required to agree to defer the final US$7 million payable on delivery of each o f the vessels for a period of 12 months.
In consultation with the Committee, the Advisors indicated that Bondholders

<<<

 may be amenable to assist Remedial with an interest deferral and a release of most of the escrowed funds, provided that a contribution was also made from Remedial's shareholders so that Bondholders could retain at least US$7 million of the

<<<

 escrowed funds to ensure that they could perfect a first priority mortgage over ESV2 (in the expectation that this would be the first vessel to deliver), and so that Remedial would have a reasonable amount of working capital going forward,

<<<

 After discussions with Remedial's major shareholders, it became apparent to Remedial's management and advisers, however, that the necessary investment was not available from Remedial's principal shareholders.
Accordingly, the Advisors, in consultation

<<<

 with the Committee, put forth a proposal for the restructuring of Remedial in the form of the term sheet set out in Appendix A to this summons (the "Term Sheet"). This proposal is detailed in section 3 below, The key terms of the proposal are

<<<

 a debt for equity swap where all of the indebtedness under the Bonds other than $56.5, million is exchanged on a pro rata basis for new shares representing 95% of Remedial's post-restructuring share capital, with the remaining 5% of the share

<<<

 to be retained by the current shareholders. The residual US$56.5 million of indebtedness under the Bonds would be made available to Remedial for general working capital purposes, restructuring costs and shipyard payments to procure delivery

<<<

 of the Vessels in the form of a loan. The Advisors have indicated that the Committee in principle is supportive of a restructuring in the form of the proposal, and that this is likely to present the only remaining opportunity for a consensual

<<<

 restructuring of Remedial's balance sheet that would avoid the alternative of insolvency proceedings. The Advisors suggested that Remedial was left with little option in the circumstances but to propose a restructuring in the form of the Term

<<<

 Sheet to both Remedial's shareholders and the Bondholders,
Accordingly, Remedial summoned an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders that was held on 14 December 2009 (the "EGM"), in order to approve various resolutions (the "EGM

<<<

 Resolutions"), and in particular those required to implement the proposal from the Advisors. All resolutions were approved by the extraordinary general meeting. A copy of the minutes from the EGM is attached at Appendix B to this summons.
At

<<<

 the EGM, three new members were elected for the board of directors, Svein Eggen was nominated by current shareholders, while Eugene Davis and James Dolphin were nominated by the Bondholders. Bradley Scher was also subsequently appointed to

<<<

 the Board, The Board now consists of these four directors, with Eugene Davis as Chairman.
Remedial also opted to have a three member director nomination committee comprising of the Chairman and two representatives of the Bondholders as future

<<<

 shareholders. The existing members of the board nomination committee resigned on the date of the EGM, and Ivan Capriello from Deutsche Bank and Monish Sahni from CQS Management Limited, were
2

N O R SK TILLITSM A N N ASA www.triislee.no
elected

<<<

 upon nomination by the Bondholders. Eugene Davis also became a member of the nomination committee in his capacity as Chairman of the board.
Due to its critical cash position, Remedial approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders' meeting

<<<

 before setting out the proposal to the bondholders from the Advisors, in order to consider a partial release of US$3 million of the funds that were held in the Escrow Account in order to allow closing of the Restructuring Proposal (if approved

<<<

) or otherwise to allow Remedial to make arrangements with the Advisors for an organised winddown of its affairs. That funding proposal was approved by the necessary majority of the Bondholders on 11 December 2009. The Loan Trustee was also

<<<

 authorised to move the balance of the proceeds of the Bonds from the Escrow Account to an account held in the name of the Loan Trustee (the "NTM Account"). In return for the release of the US$3 million of funds from the NTM Account, additional

<<<

 security was provided by Remedial over certain OFE engines and rack and chord leg material. The summons for that Bondholders' meeting which explains the funding arrangement is attached at Appendix C to this summons.
Pursuant to the resolutions

<<<

 passed at the Bondholders' meeting held on 11 December 2009, US$3 million was subsequently released from the funds held in the NTM Account in order to enable Remedial to meet its working capital requirements, Following that release, the balance

<<<

 on the monies transferred into the NTM Account stood at (and is currently) US$53.5 million. Substantially all of those US$3 million of funds have now been expended by Remedial. By the end of January 2010, Remedial's free cash position was US

<<<

$0.5 million cash only. Remedial will shortly require further funding to meet its on-going working capital requirements. Remedial has not indentified any alternative sources of funding. Accordingly, if the Restructuring Proposal (as described

<<<

 below) is not approved by the Bondholders, or the conditions precedent to the implementation of the Restructuring Propsal are not satisfied or waived, Remedial expects to make arrangements for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs and

<<<

 the realisation of its assets, in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders and, to the extent of Remedial's unsecured assets, Remedial's other creditors,
Please refer to the Remedial's third quarter release of 2009 attached as Appendix

<<<

 D to this summons which is intended to provide the last reported statement of Remedial's financial and operational status. Bondholders are encouraged to read all of the documents attached to this summons.
3. THE RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
Remedial

<<<

 has asked the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders' meeting to approve the proposed restructuring summarised below, which reflects the proposal set out in the Term Sheet. The. necessary resolutions to implement the proposal were approved by

<<<

 Remedial's shareholders at the EGM (the "Restructuring Proposal").
3,1 Partial conversion to shares and write down o f theprincipal
The Restructuring Proposal includes a conversion to equity of all indebtedness (including accrued but unpaid

<<<

 interest) under the Loan other than US$56.5 million (the "Residual Loan") through the issuance to the Bondholders of new ordinary shares on a pro rata basis representing 95% of the post-restructuring share capital of Remedial (the "Bondholder

<<<

 Shares"). It is intended that Remedial's shares, including the Bondholder Shares, will remain listed on the Oslo Axess. The listing of the Bondholder Shares will be subject to the approval of Oslo Axess and the publication of a listing prospectus

<<<

. It is expected that the Bondholder Shares will be listed within four weeks of the date of the Bondholders' meeting. The new share capital of Remedial after the issuance of the Bondholder Shares to the Bondholders will

NORSIC TILLITSM A

<<<

 N N ASA www.lTiisree.no
be 588,818,480 shares with a nominal value of NOK 0.00025. The Bondholders will receive 559,377,556 ordinary shares of Remedial with a nominal value of NOK 0.0025 each.
Remedial's current shareholders passed the EGM

<<<

 Resolutions at the EGM held on 14 December 2009 for the authorisation of the increase of share capital sufficient for the issue of the Bondholder Shares, and the subsequent issuance of the Bondholder Shares. This authorisation is effective

<<<

 until 14 February 2010,
Following the issuance of the Bondholder Shares, the current shareholders of Remedial will retain 5% of the post-restructuring share capital of Remedial (the "Existing Shares"),
The Bondholder Shares may be subject to

<<<

 dilution if Remedial implements the Rights Issue described in paragraph 3.4 below, and all post-restructuring shareholders will be subject to dilution by any shares issued in respect of a management incentive scheme as described in paragraph

<<<

 3,5 below.
3.2 Residual Loan
The Residual Loan of US$56.5 million that will remain in place following the proposed restructuring is an amount equivalent to the aggregate of (i) the US$53.5 million balance currently held in the NTM Account,

<<<

 and (ii) the US$3 million which was advanced to Remedial from the NTM Account pursuant to the resolutions passed at the Bondholders' meeting held on 11 December 2009,
If the Restructuring Proposal is approved, the remaining US$53.5 million

<<<

 in the NTM Account will be made available to Remedial for use for restructuring costs, agreed shipyard payments to procure delivery of the Vessels and for general working capital purposes. Of this, US$1.5million would be used to settle the

<<<

 unsecured claims of Swedbank AB and SEB Enskilda AS against Remedial as detailed hi section 3.3 below. Remedial's current cashflow forecasts anticipate that the US$53.5 million will be exhausted by the end of June. Remedial would also intend

<<<

 to seek to raise at least a further US$20 million in additional financing (debt or equity) following the restructuring to cover the period up to the end of December. The proposed restructuring and additional financing will allow Remedial to

<<<

 take delivery of the two Vessels, and seek employment or sale opportunities for them in a non-distressed environment.
Attached to this summons at Appendix E is a copy of the latest draft of the proposed loan agreement with respect to the Residual

<<<

 Loan to be entered into by Remedial and the Loan Trustee in the event that the Restructuring Proposal is approved. This remains subject to final agreement, and is subject to such amendments as the Loan Trustee may agree in consultation with

<<<

, and based on feedback from, the Committee and the Advisors, taking into account that, following the proposed restructuring, the Bondholders hi the Residual Loan will also be Remedial's majority shareholders (the "D raft Loan Agreement").
However

<<<

, on any basis the Draft Loan Agreement will provide for, inter alia, interest on the Residual Loan to accrue at a rate of at least 10.00% per annum. Interest will be capitalised and added to the principal amount of the Residual Loan until the

<<<

 first interest payment date falling at least 30 days after the commencement date of the charter of either of the Vessels, Following the charter of either of the Vessels, interest will be payable in cash. The Interest Payment Dates will remain

<<<

 the same.
It is a proposed term of the Residual Loan that each of the Construction Contracts shall be transferred to separate Vessel Owning Companies, The Vessel Owning Companies are likely
4

N O R SK TILLITSM A N N ASA
www.rmstec.no
to be

<<<

 established in Bahamas and will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Remedial. The Vessel Owning Companies shall provide security over the Construction Contracts which shall at least be the same as the existing Loan Security, and a mortgage over

<<<

 the Vessels upon completion, in each case in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee,, In addition, Remedial and the Vessel Owning Companies shall, provide a floating charge in favour of the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders in the

<<<

 Residual Loan) over all their business and assets.
The Loan Agreement shall permit the granting of first priority mortgages in favour of the Yards with respect to the deferred instalments due to them, but the Yards will be required to waive

<<<

 any rights of counterclaim or set-off which they may have and it will be a requirement that the Loan Trustee and the Bondholders shall have a direct right to repay the Yard on the deferred amount due to them. The Yards will also be required

<<<

 to provide written consent to the granting of the security in favour of the Loan Trustee and the transfer of the Construction Contracts to the Vessel Owning Companies. The Loan Trustee shall be entitled to waive these requirements in consultation

<<<

 with the Advisors,
The Loan Agreement shall also allow for an additional debt facility of US$20 million to be secured against the Vessels ranking on pari passu with the Residual Loan,
3.3 Swedbank AB attdSEB Enskilda
It is a condition precedent

<<<

 to the proposed restructuring that Remedial agrees to compromise two significant unsecured claims from financial institutions for no more than US$1.5 million. The first of these is a claim by Swedbank AB (publ) ("Swedbank") of approximately

<<<

 US$7.2 million which has terminated three interest rate swap confirmations with Swedbank governed by an ISDA master agreement dated 20 November 2008 (the "Swap Contracts") following a missed payment which was due on 28 September 2009. The second

<<<

 is a claim from SEB Enskilda AB ("SEB") of up to US$2.6 million under an engagement letter dated 17 July 2009 (the "Engagement Letter"), pursuant to which SEB was engaged by Remedial to provide financial advice on a restructuring of Remedial

<<<

's capital structure.
The proposed restructuring will not be viable if Remedial cannot compromise any obligation it may to pay these amounts in full. Further, Remedial has received feedback from the Committee that they will not support payments

<<<

 of this magnitude being made in full to unsecured creditors who are not critical to the delivery of the Vessels. However, the Committee has suggested that it will support a settlement of these claims in an aggregate amount of up to US$1.5 million

<<<

 (up to US$1.25 million to Swedbank and up to US$0.25 million to SEB), This is estimated to be more than these claims would receive in an insolvency proceeding for Remedial, where SEB would not be entitled to any payment at all.
It shall be

<<<

 a condition precedent to the implementation of the Restructuring Proposal that agreement with Swedbank and SEB on these terms is achieved by the date of the Bondholders' meeting in relation to this summons.
3.4 Rights issue
The shareholder

<<<

 resolutions passed at the EGM authorised (but did not require) Remedial to carry out a rights issue of shares for an aggregate gross subscription price of US$20 million at a pre-money equity valuation o f US$161.3 million (the "Rights Issue

<<<

") which must be closed and subscribed for within 45 days of the issuance of the Bondholder Shares to the Bondholders. Only the pre-restructuring shareholders (the shareholders holding 5% of the post-restructuring shares) would be given a right

<<<

 to subscribe, The board of directors will. determine the record date for the Rights Issue which will be prior to the date of the issue of
5

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA www.tru.stee.no
shares to the Bondholders. The subscription rights

<<<

 would be tradable and would be exercisable by any person who acquires such subscription rights. A complete subscription of the shares available under the terms of the Rights Issue would result in the issuance of 73,009,111 new shares (the 

<<<

"Rights Issue Shares"). The Rights Issue Shares would have a nominal value of US$0.0025 each and be subscribed for at a premium of US$ 0.2714 (i.e. for the total price of US dollar 0.2739) per share,
Following such a Rights Issue, and assuming

<<<

 subscription in full for the Rights Issue Shares, the Bondholders would own approximately 84.5% of the enlarged share capital of Remedial and 100% of the Residual Loan, The new share capital of Remedial, in the event that the Rights Issue was

<<<

 completed, would be 661,827,591 shares ofNOIC 0.0025 each,
3.5 Management Incentive Scheme
The .Restructuring Proposal provides for the creation of a management incentive scheme whereby Remedial's board of directors will be authorised to grant

<<<

 to Remedial's management warrants or options to acquire shares representing an amount equal to up to 5%> of the post restructuring share capital (after taking into account the issuance of any Rights Issue Shares) prior to the granting of any

<<<

 such warrants or options. This was approved at the EGM.
3.6 The Vessels and the Yards
Each of the Yards have agreed (in the case of Yantai, in principle) to defer instalments of US$7 million each due to them under the terms of the Construction

<<<

 Contracts. The Restructuring Proposal provides for security to be provided to the Yards, with respect to those deferred instalments of US$7 million each, in the form of a secured note (the "Yard Notes") secured by a first-ranking mortgage over

<<<

 the respective Vessels. The Yard Notes shall be payable 12 months after delivery of each of the Vessels, will accrue interest on an annual basis at a rate of 3.00% per annum. Cosco and Yantai (in the case of Yantai, in principle) have also

<<<

 given Remedial the option to store the Vessels at the Yards, free of charge, for a period of three and six months respectively after delivery.
It shall be a condition precedent to the implementation of the Restructuring Proposal that the Yards

<<<

 (a) provide written consent to the granting of the security in favour of the Loan Trustee, (b) provide written consent to the transfer of the Construction Contracts to the Vessel Owning Companies, (c) waive any rights of counterclaim or set

<<<

-off which they may have and (d) allow the Loan Trustee or the Bondholders to have a direct right to repay the Yard Notes from the amounts held in the Escrow Account or otherwise, The documentation of these agreements and terms with the Yards

<<<

 shall be in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (in consultation with the Advisors). However, the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to waive these conditions precedent in consultation with the Advisors.
3.7 Conditions
The Bondholders' acceptance

<<<

 of the Restructuring Proposal is conditional on the following (provided that (i) may be waived by the Loan Trustee in consultation with the Advisors):
(i) execution of documentation reflecting the terms of the agreements with the Yards detailed

<<<

 above, in a form satisfactory of the Loan Trustee (in consultation with the Advisors) by no later that the date of the Bondholders' meeting in relation to this summons; and
6

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
www.misinMio
(ii) execution of agreements

<<<

 for the settlement of the SEB and Swedbank claims in relation to the Engagement Letter and Swap Contracts respectively, for an aggregate amount of no more than US$1.5 million in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (in consultation with

<<<

 the Advisors) by no later than the date of the Bondholders' meeting in relation to this summons,
The amendments to the Loan Agreement shall be conditional upon the issuance to Bondholders of the Bondholder Shares.
4. EVALUATION OF THE RESTRUCTURING

<<<

 PROPOSAL
4.1 Effect o f the restructuring Proposal
Remedial's current cashflow forecasts anticipate that the US$53.5 million will be exhausted by the end of June. Remedial would also intend to seek to raise at least a further US$20 million

<<<

 in additional financing (debt or equity) following the restructuring to cover the period up to the end of December. The proposed restructuring and such additional financing will allow Remedial to take delivery of the two Vessels, and seek employment

<<<

 or sale opportunities for them in a non-distressed environment.
4.2 Remedial's evaluation o f the Restructuring Proposal
Remedial believes that the Restructuring Proposal will have a positive effect on the overall capital structure of Remedial

<<<

 and the interests of its stakeholders, following completion of the Restructuring Proposal.
4.3 · Non-reliance .: Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by any o f the Loan Trustee, AMA or Bingham. Bondholders should

<<<

 independently evaluate the Restructuring Proposal and vote accordingly.
5. FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
hi the event that the Restructuring Proposal is not approved, or the conditions precedent are not satisfied or waived, it

<<<

 will not be possible to implement the Restructuring Proposal. At that stage, Remedial will have no further funds available to it, and Remedial does not expect that Bondholders will provide further, funding to it as a going concern. In such

<<<

 circumstances, the board of Remedial expects to make arrangements for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs and a realisation of its assets in a manner that seeks to maximise recoveries and value for the Bondholders and (to the extent

<<<

 of its unsecured assets) other creditors.
Remedial is currently in discussion with the Advisors to plan for this eventuality. It is expected that the Loan Trustee will enforce the security for the Loan (most likely through the appointment of

<<<

 a Cypriot law receiver which may or may not be followed by a liquidation of Remedial), or in the alternative that agreement will be reached for the commencement of Chapter 11 Proceedings hi the United States to effect a sale of Remedial's assets

<<<

.
In such circumstances, there will still be a requirement for funding to be made available from the NTM Account to prepare for and implement such actions (hereinafter described as the "Recovery Loans"). Following consultation with the Advisors

<<<

, it is therefore proposed that the Bondholders' meeting provide the necessaiy approvals to the Loan Trustee to provide this funding from the NTM Account, as described below.
7

NORSK TILLITSM A N N ASA www.tmsicc.no
5.1 Recovery Loans - Chapter

<<<

 11 proceedings
Iri the event that agreement is reached between Remedial and the Advisors (in consultation with the Committee) for the commencement of Chapter 11 proceedings if the Restructuring Proposal cannot be implemented, Remedial would

<<<

 need to be provided with funding for costs incurred both prior to and during the Chapter 11 proceedings.
Remedial will need to be in position to meet the costs and expenses of its own legal advisers in preparing to commence Chapter 11 proceedings

<<<

. It is therefore proposed that the Loan Trustee be authorised to provide additional funding for this purpose of up to $250,000 from the funds currently held in the NTM Account. Such amount would be advanced to Remedial under the terms of the

<<<

 existing Loan Agreement and shall be secured by the security already granted in relation to the US$3 million partial release which was approved at the Bondholders' meeting held on 11 December 2009 (as explained above, and the summons for which

<<<

 is attached as Appendix C).
It is proposed that the Loan Trustee be authorised to provide funding from the NTM Account for the period following the filing of the petition commencing Chapter 11 proceedings in the form of a super priority debtor

<<<

-in-possession loan (a "DIP Loan"). The terms of the DIP Loan would be on market standard terms as negotiated by the Advisors in consultation with the Loan Trustee and the Committee, including a requirement that, subject to approval of the US

<<<

 Bankruptcy Court, Remedial provides adequate protection collateral over all of its unsecured assets to the extent of the DIP Loan. The amount of a DIP Loan to be made available from the NTM Account shall not exceed US$5 million without further

<<<

 approval of the Bondholders, It should be noted that this amount would cover several areas of costs, including the following: firstly, Remedial's own legal costs, and the legal costs of any unsecured creditors' committee, which are estimated

<<<

 to be in the region of US$1,000,000US$1,500,000; secondly, the running costs of Remedial during the Chapter 11 proceedings: these are effectively some of the same costs that would have been incurred by Remedial had the proposed restructuring

<<<

 been implemented and had Remedial therefore had access to the funds in the NTM Account; and thirdly, the costs and expenses of the Advisors, which it is expected would need to be covered by Remedial as a term of the DIP Loan.
5.2 Recovery Loans

<<<

 ~costs o f receiver/liquidator
In the event that it is determined by the Loan Trustee, in consultation with the Advisors and the Committee that the Loan Trustee should appoint a receiver over the assets secured in its favour, the Loan Trustee

<<<

 will need to provide funding, and potentially an indemnity to the receiver. In such circumstances, it is proposed that the Loan Trustee be authorised to meet (or undertake to cover) the fees, costs and expenses of the receiver (including, without

<<<

 limitation, the cost of hiring management teams at the Yards) out of the NTM Account in an amount up to US$5 million, and to provide an indemnity to the receiver up to the extent of the assets secured in favour of the Loan Trustee in relation

<<<

 to the Loan Agreement (including any balance remaining from time to time in the NTM Account).
It is also possible that Remedial may enter into liquidation in Cyprus, either alongside or instead of a receivership. In this event, the liquidator

<<<

 may need funding in order to be in a position to take steps to realise Remedial's assets, hi such circumstances, it is proposed that the Loan Trustee be authorised to meet (or undertake to cover) the fees, costs and expenses of a liquidator

<<<

 out of the NTM Account in an amount up to US$5 million (less any funds advanced in meeting, or committed to meet, the fees, costs and expenses of a receiver).
8

N O R SK TIL L IT SM A N N ASA
www.tmMfc.no
It is proposed that any funds made

<<<

 available from the NTM Account to a receiver or a liquidator would be on terms to be agreed by the Loan Trustee, following consultation with the Advisors and the Committee, and provided that it is confirmed that they will be an expense of the

<<<

 receivership or the liquidation respectively, repayable on the applicable super priority basis.
