 release.
CEO Statement
Paul Wogan, Chief Executive Officer, stated: "I am pleased to report another record quarter of revenues and EBITDA for GasLog, driven by the initial contribution of our 2018 newbuild deliveries and the stronger performance

<<<

 of the vessels operating in the LNG carrier pooling arrangement (the "Cool Pool"). On the back of our improving financial performance, our strong balance sheet and our confidence in the long-term prospects for the company, I am delighted to

<<<

 announce a 7.1% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share.
During the quarter, we continued to execute on our business plan, taking delivery of three newbuilds, the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Genoa and the GasLog Hong Kong, all

<<<

 on time and on budget. Due to their fuel efficient engines and low boil-off rate, these vessels will have highly competitive unit freight costs. We also continued to execute on our long-term growth strategy, recycling capital through the drop

<<<

-down of the GasLog Gibraltar to GasLog Partners and ordering two newbuild LNG carriers for delivery in the second quarter o f2020. In addition, GasLog Partners announced two charter agreements with a new customer, simultaneously meeting key

<<<

 objectives of increasing the Partnership's contracted revenues and diversifying its customer base.
During the quarter, global LNG supply continued to increase, with Wood Mackenzie forecasting 9% growth in volumes during 2018. Although no new

<<<

 supply projects have yet taken a final investment decision ("FID") in 2018, several major projects continue to make progress and we remain confident that additional liquefaction capacity will be sanctioned in 2018 and 2019.
As expected, LNG

<<<

 carrier spot rates experienced a seasonal decline from the multi-year highs of Q4 2017. However, headline spot rates remain higher year-on-year, and there are signs that rates have bottomed out as buyers now look to source supply for cooling

<<<

 demand in the Northern Hemisphere summer and heating demand in the Southern Hemisphere winter. We expect rates to strengthen in the second half of this year.

4

The Alexandroupolis Project continues to make good progress and we signed the

<<<

 O&M agreement during the quarter. Negotiations with the Greek national gas utility, DEPA, and Bulgarian Energy Holding ("BEH") regarding equity participation in Gastrade S.A. ("Gastrade") are ongoing and, as noted in the Press Release of May

<<<

 3, 2018 issued by Gastrade and DEPA, the Managing Directors of DEPA and Gastrade reached agreement regarding the future reservation of capacity in the terminal by DEPA. In addition, BEH confirmed its intention to speed up the respective negotiations

<<<

 for the completion of its own participation in the project. FID is still expected in the fourth quarter of 2018."
LNG Market Update and Outlook
Global LNG production continued to grow in Q1 2018, registering a 10% year-on-year increase and

<<<

 a 2% increase over Q4 2017 as measured by Wood Mackenzie. The ramp-up of the Yamal project in Russia has outperformed expectations, the first commercial cargo from Cove Point in the United States was exported in April and legacy liquefaction

<<<

 capacity operated at high utilization to take advantage of the high prices caused by strong demand growth partly driven by the cold Northern Hemisphere winter. However, new supply growth was partly offset by several plant outages, principally

<<<

 at PNG LNG following an earthquake in late February, and shorter outages of other projects in Malaysia, Russia and Peru.
While a number of projects expected onstream in 2018 have experienced delays, Wood Mackenzie currently expects that some

<<<

 29 million tonnes per annum ("mtpa") of capacity will enter commercial service between Q2 and Q4 2018, underpinning the forecasted 2018 supply of 325 mtpa, or 9% growth over 2017. Among the projects which Wood Mackenzie expects onstream in

<<<

 2018 are Wheatstone Train 2 (Q2), Ichthys (Q3) and Prelude (Q4) in Australia, Cameroon floating LNG (Q2) and the second train at Yamal (Q4). A further 51 mtpa is forecast by Wood Mackenzie to come onstream over the 2019-2021 period. These estimates

<<<

 reflect recent news flow on the expected commissioning dates of the Ichthys, Freeport and Prelude projects.
According to Wood Mackenzie, in Q1 2018, 10 mtpa of long-term supply contracts were agreed, bringing the total volume of long-term supply

<<<

 contracts signed since the beginning of 2017 to 37 mtpa, demonstrating strengthening interest from LNG buyers and potential support for sanctioning of further liquefaction capacity. Also during the first quarter, a number of potential new projects

<<<

 continued to make good progress towards FID, including projects in the United States such as Corpus Christi Train 3, in Canada (boosted by British Columbia tax relief proposals) and in Mozambique (the Area 1 project), as well as the announcement

<<<

 by the PNG LNG partners of reaching an agreement on plans to double exports from Papua New Guinea's LNG facility to 16 mtpa.
LNG market participants continue to forecast significant growth in LNG demand. Consensus compound annual growth rate

<<<

 in LNG demand of 6% is forecast over the 2017-2025 period. Based upon Wood Mackenzie's forecasts of supply either onstream or under construction, this suggests the market may be short of LNG as soon as 2020, reiterating the need for further

<<<

 LNG supply projects to be sanctioned in the near-term. LNG continues to be seen as an attractive way to diversify energy imports, with Germany being the most recent country to articulate plans to develop LNG import infrastructure.
As measured

<<<

 by Poten, tonne miles in Q1 2018 were 18% higher year on year, continuing the significant growth trend seen in 2017. Structural changes in the LNG market, such as fragmentation of market participants, the increasing market share of portfolio

<<<

 suppliers such as Shell, Total and BP plc and commodity traders, and a move away from destination clauses in supply contracts are all increasing the amount of LNG traded and bode well for further increases in tonne miles.
Headline spot TFDE

<<<

 LNG shipping rates as reported by Clarksons have exhibited seasonal weakness in recent months, declining to $38,000 per day in late April from approximately $80,000 per day at the beginning of the year. The decline has been more rapid than

<<<

 expected and exacerbated by a number of one-off factors, including the unplanned downtime at LNG facilities mentioned above, delays in the commissioning of new liquefaction supply and the delivery of 18 newbuild LNG carriers during the first

<<<

 quarter of 2018. Nonetheless, current spot rates of $42,000 are 40% ahead of levels from a year ago. While the market may continue to be affected by seasonal factors driving LNG supply and demand, and there may be further delays to the commissioning

<<<

 of new liquefaction projects currently under construction, we remain optimistic that a tightening shipping market, driven by the positive outlook for LNG demand growth and the evolving LNG shipping market, will result in spot rates improving

<<<

 from current levels over time.
This positive outlook and the perceived requirement for new ships have resulted in 18 firm newbuild LNG carrier orders so far in 2018, of which two are GasLog vessels. Based on our analysis of expected LNG demand

<<<

, between 35 and 62 additional LNG carriers will be needed by the end of 2022 and potentially as many as 117 vessels by 2025 to satisfy projected market growth.
New Charter Agreements
GasLog Partners entered into agreements with a new customer

<<<

 for two new charters plus options for an additional two charters, exercisable by the charterer. The agreements include an approximately three-and-a-half-year charter for the GasLog Santiago, a 155,000 cbm tri-fuel diesel electric ("TFDE") LNG

<<<

 carrier built in 2013, commencing in either August or September 2018 at the Partnership's option, and a one-year charter for a 145,000 cbm steam-powered ("Steam") vessel (either the 2006-built Methane Jane Elizabeth or the 2007-built Methane

<<<

 Alison Victoria as nominated by the Partnership) commencing in either November or December 2019 at the Partnership's option. The charterer has options to extend the first charter for up to an additional seven years and the second charter for

<<<

 up to an additional four years, both at escalating rates.
Delivery of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa
On January 8, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Houston, a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion

<<<

 constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. ("Hyundai"). The vessel completed a short-term charter to a major LNG producer and is currently available in the spot market until the commencement of her multi-year charter party with a subsidiary

<<<

 of Shell, from the end of 2018 until April 2028.
On March 20, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Hong Kong, a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Hyundai. The vessel was originally scheduled to commence a multi

<<<

-year charter with Total in December 2018 ending in 2025. However, the commencement
5

of the charter was brought forward to delivery from the yard, thus increasing the period of the charter to Total. Whilst the charter hire rate for this additional

<<<

 initial period is lower than that which GasLog will enjoy for the period from December 2018 to 2025, delivery of the vessel straight into charter from the yard together with the additional charter hire resulted in significant operational efficiencies

<<<

 for GasLog.
On March 29, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Genoa, a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Samsung. The vessel commenced her charter party agreement with Shell upon delivery until 2027.
Additional

<<<

 Vessels
On January 12, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for the construction of a 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2213) that is scheduled to be delivered in the second

<<<

 quarter o f2020. This vessel will now be the vessel to be chartered to Pioneer Shipping Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica plc ("Centrica"), for an initial period of approximately seven years, as previously announced on October

<<<

 20, 2016. The 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex Plus LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2212) to be delivered in the third quarter of 2019 is currently without charter.
On March 9, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding contract with

<<<

 Samsung for the construction of a 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex Plus LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2274) that is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter o f2020 and is currently without charter.
GasLog Partners' Issuance

<<<

 of Series B Preference Units
On January 17, 2018, GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 4,600,000 8.200% Series B Preference Units (including 600,000 units issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase

<<<

 additional Series B Preference Units), liquidation preference $25.00 per unit, at a price to the public of $25.00 per preference unit. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering

<<<

 expenses were $111.2 million. The Series B Preference Units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "GLOP PR B".
Sale o f the GasLos Gibraltar
On April 16, 2018, GasLog entered into a share purchase agreement for the sale

<<<

 to GasLog Partners of 100% of the ownership interest in GASfourteen Ltd., the entity that owns the GasLog Gibraltar, for an aggregate purchase price of $207.0 million, which includes $1.0 million for positive net working capital balances transferred

<<<

 with the entity. GasLog Partners financed the acquisition with cash on hand, $45.0 million of new privately placed common units issued to GasLog (1,858,975 common units at a price of $24.21 per unit), and the assumption of the GasLog Gibraltar

<<<

's outstanding indebtedness of $143.6 million. The sale closed on April 26, 2018.
Alexandroupolis Project update
On February 23, 2018, GasLog entered into an agreement to provide O&M services to the Alexandroupolis Project. In addition, Gastrade

<<<

 is currently in discussions with a number of additional potential investors, including DEPA, the Greek state-owned gas company, and BEH, the holding company of the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy, and targets to take FID by the end of 2018 with

<<<

 the FSRU currently scheduled to be operational by the end o f2020. Following a trilateral meeting between DEPA, BEH and Gastrade, the Managing Directors of DEPA and Gastrade reached agreement regarding the future reservation of capacity in

<<<

 the terminal by DEPA. In addition, BEH confirmed its intention to speed up the respective negotiations for the completion of its own participation in the project.
GasLog Partners' At-the-Market Common Units Equity Offering Programme (the "ATM

<<<

 Programme")
On May 16, 2017, GasLog Partners commenced an ATM Programme under which the Partnership may, from time to time, raise equity through the issuance and sale of new common units having an aggregate offering value of up to $100.0 million

<<<

 in accordance with the terms of an equity distribution agreement entered into on the same date. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

<<<

 agreed to act as sales agents. On November 3, 2017, the size of the ATM Programme was increased to $144.0 million and UBS Securities LLC was included as a sales agent.
Since the commencement of the ATM Programme through March 31,2018, GasLog

<<<

 Partners has issued and received payment for a total of 2,737,405 common units, with cumulative gross proceeds of $62.9 million at a weighted average price of $22.97 per unit, representing a discount of 0.5% to the volume weighted average trading

<<<

 price of GasLog Partners' common units on the days on which new common units were issued. No issuances of common units were made under the ATM Programme in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31,2018, the cumulative net proceeds were $6

There were 2,163 operating

<<<

 days for the quarter ended March 31,2018, as compared to 2,070 operating days for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in operating days resulted mainly from the deliveries of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog

 Genoa on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively.

Revenues were $138.5 million for the quarter ended March 31,2018 ($128.3 million for the quarter ended March 31,2017). The increase was mainly driven by the increased

Net pool allocation was $8.7 million for the quarter ended March 31,2018 ($0.8 million

Voyage expenses and commissions were $5.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($2.9 million for the quarter ended March 31,2017). The increase

 mentioned above, partially offset by the increased amount allocated to third parties as a result of the GasLog Partners' equity offerings in January 2017, its ATM Programme initiated in May 2017, the issuances of the Series A Preference Units

<<<

 in May 2017 and the Series B Preference Units in January 2018, and the sale of three vessels.

EBITDA(1) was $95.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($89.1 million for the quarter ended March 31,2017). The increase in EBITDA was

<<<

 driven by the increases in revenues and the increase in the net pool allocation, partially offset by the increases in vessel operating expenses and in the general and administrative expenses as discussed above.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $95.

<<<

5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($89.3 million for the quarter ended March 31,2017).

EPS was $0.21 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($0.08 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase in earnings per share is mainly

<<<

 attributable to the respective movements in profit attributable to the owners of GasLog discussed above.

Adjusted EPS(1) was a loss of $0.01 for the quarter ended March 31,2018 (earnings of $0.06 for the quarter ended March 31,2017), adjusted

<<<

 for the effects of the non-cash gain on swaps and the net foreign exchange gains/losses.

(1) Adjusted Profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for

<<<


GasLog's financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. For definitions and reconciliations of these measurements to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, please refer to Exhibit

<<<

 II at the end of this press release.

Contracted Charter Revenues

<<<

 effect as of March 31,2018, without including any extension options. As of March 31,2018, the total future firm contracted revenue stood at $3.1 billion(1), including the 13 vessels currently owned by GasLog Partners, but excluding the vessels

<<<

 operating in the spot market.

(1)Contracted revenue calculations assume: (a) 365 revenue days per annum, with 30 off-hire days when the ship undergoes scheduled dry-docking and ten additional off-hire days for the enhancements of three vessels

EXHIBIT II

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS

<<<



EBITDA is defined as earnings before depreciation, amortization, financial income and costs, gain/loss on swaps and taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before foreign exchange gains/losses. Adjusted Profit represents earnings before

<<<

 write-off and accelerated amortization of unamortized loan fees/bond fees and premium, foreign exchange gains/losses and non-cash gain/loss on swaps that includes (if any) (a) unrealized gain/loss on derivative financial instruments held for

<<<

 trading, (b) recycled loss of cash flow hedges reclassified to profit or loss and (c) ineffective portion of cash flow hedges. Adjusted EPS represents earnings attributable to owners of the Group before non-cash gain/loss on swaps as defined

<<<

 above, foreign exchange gains/losses and write-off and accelerated amortization of unamortized loan/bond fees and premium, divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS

<<<

 are non-GAAP financial measures that are used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users of financial statements, such as investors, to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP

<<<

 financial measures assist our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. We believe that including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS assists our management and

<<<

 investors in (i) understanding and analyzing the results of our operating and business performance, (ii) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives and (iii) monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength

<<<

 in assessing whether to purchase and/or to continue to hold our common shares. This is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, financial costs, gain/loss on swaps

<<<

, taxes, depreciation and amortization; in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, foreign exchange gains/losses; and in the case of Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS, non-cash gain/loss on swaps, foreign exchange gains/losses and write-off and accelerated

<<<

 amortization of unamortized loan/bond fees and premium, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, financial market conditions, capital structure and historical cost basis, and which items may significantly

<<<

 affect results of operations between periods.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or as substitutes for, or superior to, profit, profit

<<<

 from operations, earnings per share or any other measure of operating performance presented in accordance with IFRS. Some of these limitations include the fact that they do not reflect (i) our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital

<<<

 expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs and (iii) the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt. Although depreciation and amortization

<<<

 are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and

<<<

 Adjusted EPS are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as

<<<

 a comparative measure.

In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation

<<<

 of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items. Therefore, the non-GAAP financial measures as presented below may not be comparable

<<<

 to similarly titled measures of other companies in the shipping or other industries.

 "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
Forward-Looking Statements

Overview
We are an international owner, operator and manager of LNG carriers. Our wholly owned fleet as of May 4, 2018, consists of 16 LNG carriers, including 12 ships in operation and four LNG carriers on order at Samsung

<<<

 Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. ("Samsung"). GasLog is also the general and controlling partner in GasLog Partners LP ("GasLog Partners" or the "Partnership"), a publicly traded master limited partnership, which owns 13 LNG carriers. In addition

<<<

, GasLog has leased back under a bareboat charter one vessel sold to Lepta Shipping Co., Ltd. ("Lepta Shipping"), a subsidiary of Mitsui Co., Ltd. ("Mitsui") in February 2016, for a period of up to 20 years. GasLog has the option to re-purchase

<<<

 the vessel on pre agreed terms no earlier than the end of year ten and no later than the end of year 17 of the bareboat charter. We currently manage and operate 26 LNG carriers including 12 of our wholly owned ships in operation, 12 of the

<<<

 13 ships contributed or sold to the Partnership (the other one is managed by a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc ("Shell")), the bareboat vessel and one LNG carrier owned by an entity in which we have a 25% interest. We are also supervising

<<<

 the construction of our newbuildings.
GasLog has entered into a pool agreement (the "Pool Agreement") with Dynagas Ltd. ("Dynagas") and Golar LNG Ltd. ("Golar") establishing an LNG carrier pooling arrangement (the "Cool Pool") to market our

<<<

 and their vessels which are currently operating in the LNG shipping spot market. The Cool Pool allows the participating owners to optimize the operation of the pool vessels through improved scheduling ability, cost efficiencies and common marketing

<<<

. The objective of the Cool Pool is to serve the transportation requirements of a rapidly growing LNG shipping market by providing customers with reliable, flexible and innovative solutions to meet their increasingly complex shipping requirements

<<<

. For the operation of the Cool Pool, a Marshall Islands service company named "The Cool Pool Limited" was incorporated in September 2015 acting as an agent.
We have a 25% interest in a ship, the Methane Nile Eagle, a 2007-built LNG carrier

<<<

 owned by Egypt LNG Shipping Ltd. (" Egypt LNG") and technically managed by us. It is currently operating under a 20-year time charter to a subsidiary of Shell.
We generate revenues by chartering our ships to customers on multi-year time charters

<<<

 and spot/short-term charters and by providing technical ship management services, including crewing, training, maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and health, safety, security and environmental ("HSSE") management and reporting

<<<

 through our wholly owned subsidiary GasLog LNG Services Ltd.
Recent Developments
New Charter Agreements
GasLog Partners entered into agreements with a new customer for two new charters plus options for an additional two charters, exercisable

<<<

 by the charterer. The agreements include an approximately three-and-a-half-year charter for the GasLog Santiago, a 155,000 cubic meters ("cbm") tri fuel diesel electric ("TFDE") LNG carrier built in 2013, commencing in either August or September

<<<

 2018 at the Partnership's option, and a oneyear charter for a 145,000 cbm steam-powered ("Steam") vessel (either the 2006-built Methane Jane Elizabeth or the 2007-built Methane Alison Victoria as nominated by the Partnership) commencing in

<<<

 either November or December 2019 at the Partnership's option. The charterer has options to extend the first charter for up to an additional seven years and the second charter for up to an additional four years, both at escalating rates.
Delivery

<<<

 of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa
On January 8, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Houston, a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. ("Hyundai").

<<<

 The vessel completed a short-term charter to a major LNG producer and is currently available in the spot market until the commencement of her multi-year charter party with a subsidiary of Shell, from the end of 2018 until April 2028.
On March

<<<

 20, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Hong Kong, a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Hyundai. The vessel was originally scheduled to commence a multi-year charter with Total Gas & Power Chartering Limited 

<<<

("Total"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Total S.A. in December 2018 ending in 2025. However, the commencement of the charter was brought forward to delivery from the yard, thus increasing the period of the charter to Total. Whilst the charter

<<<

 hire rate for this additional initial period is lower than that which GasLog will enjoy for the period from December 2018 to 2025, delivery of the vessel straight into charter from the yard together with the additional charter hire resulted

<<<

 in significant operational efficiencies for GasLog.
On March 29, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Genoa, a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Samsung. The vessel commenced her charter party agreement with Shell

<<<

 upon delivery until 2027.
Additional Vessels
On January 12, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for the construction of a 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2213) that is scheduled

<<<

 to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020. This vessel will now be the vessel to be chartered to Pioneer Shipping Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica plc ("Centrica"), for an initial period of approximately seven years, as previously

<<<

 announced on October 20, 2016. The 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex Plus LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2212) to be delivered in the third quarter of 2019 is currently without charter.
On March 9, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding

<<<

 contract with Samsung for the construction of a 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex Plus LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2274) that is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020 and is currently without charter.

<<<

 of the GasLog Gibraltar's outstanding indebtedness of $143.6 million. The sale closed on April 26, 2018.

Alexandroupolis Project update

On February 23, 2018, GasLog entered into an agreement to provide operations and maintenance ("O&M") services

<<<

 to the Alexandroupolis floating storage and regasification unit ("FSRU") project (the "Alexandroupolis Project"). In addition, Gastrade S.A. ("Gastrade") is currently in discussions with a number of additional potential investors, including

<<<

 DEPA, the Greek state-owned gas company, and Bulgarian Energy Holding ("BEH"), the holding company of the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy, and targets to take a final investment decision ("FID") by the end of 2018 with the FSRU currently scheduled

<<<

 to be operational by the end of 2020. Following a trilateral meeting between DEPA, BEH and Gastrade, the Managing Directors of DEPA and Gastrade reached agreement regarding the future reservation of capacity in the terminal by DEPA. In addition

<<<

, BEH confirmed its intention to speed up the respective negotiations for the completion of its own participation in the project.

GasLog Partners' At-the-Market Common Unit Equity Offering Programme (the "ATM Programme")

On May 16, 2017, GasLog

<<<

 Partners commenced an ATM Programme under which the Partnership may, from time to time, raise equity through the issuance and sale of new common units having an aggregate offering value of up to $100.0 million in accordance with the terms of

<<<

 an equity distribution agreement entered into on the same date. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC agreed to act as sales agents

<<<

. On November 3, 2017, the size of the ATM Programme was increased to $144.0 million and UBS Securities LLC was included as a sales agent.

Since the commencement of the ATM Programme through March 31,2018, GasLog Partners has issued and received

<<<

 payment for a total of 2,737,405 common units, with cumulative gross proceeds of $62.9 million at a weighted average price of $22.97 per unit, representing a discount of 0.5% to the volume weighted average trading price of GasLog Partners'

<<<

 common units on the days on which new common units were issued. No issuances of common units were made under the ATM Programme in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31,2018, the cumulative net proceeds were $61.2 million.

-month period ended March 31,2017 to $138.5 million during the three-month period ended March 31,2018. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $6.1 million in earnings from our vessels operating in the spot market and an increase

<<<

 of $4.8 million due to the deliveries of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decrease of

$0.6 million in revenues from the remaining vessels. The average daily hire rate increased from $61,863 for the three-month period ended March 31,2017 to $63,939 for the three-month period ended March 31,2018. There was also a decrease of $

0.1 million in revenues from technical management services mainly due to the decrease in the average number of the managed vessels owned by third parties.
Net Pool Allocation:
Net pool allocation increased by $7.9 million, from $0.8 million

<<<

 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 to $8.7 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. The increase was attributable to the movement in allocation of the net pool results in accordance with applicable profit

<<<

 deliveries of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa, increased scheduled technical maintenance costs, related to engine maintenance, intermediate surveys and certifications, and crew wages, all of which were affected

 by the unfavorable movement of the Euro ("EUR")/U.S. Dollar ("USD") exchange rate (we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge part of this exposure and the associated realized gains are recorded in Gain on

 the three-month period ended March 31,2017, to $35.5 million during the three-month period ended March 31,2018. The increase in depreciation resulted mainly from the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet in the quarter ended

General and administrative expenses increased by 18.8%, or $1.9 million, from $10.1 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, to $12.0 million

<<<

 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $1.5 million in employee costs due to the unfavorable movement of the USD against EUR and British Pound ("GBP") (we have entered into

<<<

 forward foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge part of this exposure and the associated realized gains are recorded in Gains on swaps, which is discussed below) and an increase of $0.4 million in various other expenses.
Financial

<<<

 Costs:
Financial costs increased by 12.6%, or $4.1 million, from $32.5 million during the three-month period ended March 31,2017 to $36.6 million during the three-month period ended March 31,2018. The increase is attributable to an increase

<<<

 of $4.7 million in interest expense on loans, bonds and cash flow hedges, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in amortization of deferred loan fees mainly driven by a decrease in write-offs of unamortized loan fees and a decrease

<<<

 of $0.1 million in finance lease charges. During the quarter ended March 31,2018, we had an average of $2,728.2 million of outstanding indebtedness, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%, while during the quarter ended March 31,201

<<<

7, we had an average of $2,736.0 million of outstanding indebtedness having an aggregate weighted average interest rate of 3.8%. These weighted average interest rates include interest expense on loans and cash flow hedges and interest expense

<<<

 on senior unsecured notes and cross-currency swaps ("CCSs").
Gain on Swaps:
Gain on swaps increased by $17.6 million, from $0.2 million during the three-month period ended March 31,2017 to $17.8 million during the three-month period ended March

<<<

 31, 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $14.9 million in gain from mark-to-market valuation of our derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss, which reflected a gain of $17.2 million

<<<

 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a gain of $2.3 million for the quarter ended March 31,2017, a decrease of $1.5 million in realized loss from interest rate swaps held for trading and an increase of $1.5 million in realized

<<<

 gain on forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading, partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million in the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.
Profitfor the Period:
Profit for the period increased by $19.1 million, from a profit

<<<

 of $23.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 to a profit of $42.5 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, as a result of the aforementioned factors.
Profit Attributable to Owners o f the Group:
Profit attributable

<<<

 to owners of the Group increased by $10.5 million, from $8.8 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 to $19.3 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. The increase in profit attributable to the owners of GasLog

<<<

 resulted mainly from
22

the increase in profit mentioned above, partially offset by the increase in profit attributable to the non-controlling interests (non-controlling unitholders of GasLog Partners) as a result of GasLog Partners' equity

<<<

 offerings in January 2017, its ATM Programme implemented in May 2017, the issuances of the Series A Preference Units in May 2017 and the Series B Preference Units in January 2018, and the associated sales of the GasLog Greece, the GasLog Geneva

<<<

 and the Solaris on May 3, 2017, July 3, 2017 and October 20, 2017, respectively.
Customers
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, we received 86.7% of our revenues from Shell, 9.8% of our revenues from various charterers in the spot

<<<

/short-term market, 2.9% of our revenues from a major LNG producer, 0.5% of our revenues from Total and 0.1% of our revenues from Egypt LNG, an entity in which we have a 25% ownership interest. For the three-month period ended March 31, 201

<<<

7, we received 94.1% of our revenues from Shell, 5.7% of our revenues from various charterers in the spot/short-term market and 0.2% of our revenues from Egypt LNG.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary liquidity needs are to fund our

<<<

 ship-operating expenses, to finance the purchase and construction of our newbuildings and conversions, to purchase secondhand vessels, to service our existing debt and to pay dividends. In monitoring our working capital needs, we project our

<<<

 charter hire income and the vessels' maintenance and running expenses, as well as debt service obligations, and seek to maintain adequate cash reserves in order to address revenue shortfalls or budget overruns, if any.
We anticipate that our

<<<

 primary sources of funds will be available cash, cash from operations and borrowings under existing and new debt agreements. We may also seek to raise additional common or other forms of equity, subject in each case to market conditions. We

<<<

 believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future debt and equity financing on terms acceptable to us.
Our funding and treasury activities

<<<

 are intended to meet our operating and financing requirements while maintaining appropriate liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in U.S. dollars.
As of March 31,2018, GasLog had $349.1 million of cash and cash equivalents

<<<

, of which $234.4 million was held in time deposits and the remaining balance in current accounts. Moreover, as of March 31,2018, GasLog had $10.0 million held in time deposits with an initial duration of more than three months but less than

<<<

 a year that have been classified as short-term investments and $4.9 million in restricted cash which consisted of guarantees held for vessels with respect to the enhancement of their operational performance.
As of March 31,2018, GasLog had

<<<

 an aggregate of $3.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding under its credit facilities and bond agreements, of which $182.4 million was repayable within one year, and a $211.7 million finance lease liability related to the sale and leaseback

<<<

 of the Methane Julia Louise, of which $6.4 million was repayable within one year.
As of March 31,2018, GasLog, through GasLog Partners, had prepaid in full the outstanding $29.8 million of the junior tranche of the credit agreement entered

<<<

 into on February 18, 2016, which would have been due in April 2018.
As of March 31,2018, there was undrawn available capacity of $100.0 million under the revolving credit facility of the credit agreement of up to $1.1 billion entered into on

<<<

 July 19, 2016 (the "Legacy Facility Refinancing").
As of March 31,2018, the total remaining balance of the contract prices of the four LNG carriers on order was $719.8 million which GasLog expects to be funded with the $165.8 million undrawn

<<<

 capacity under the financing agreement entered into on October 16, 2015, as well as cash balances, cash from operations and borrowings under new and existing debt agreements.
GasLog has hedged 45.8% of its expected floating interest rate exposure

<<<

 on its outstanding debt (excluding the finance lease liability) as of March 31, 2018.
Our credit facilities are described in Note 13 of our annual audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with

<<<

 the SEC on February 28, 2018 and Note 7 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Working Capital Position
As of March 31, 2018, GasLog's current assets totaled $406.6 million while current

<<<

 liabilities totaled $282.4 million, resulting in a positive working capital position of $124.2 million.
Taking into account generally expected market conditions, we anticipate that available cash and cash flow generated from operations will

 be sufficient to fund our operations, including our working capital requirements, and to make all other required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness during the next 12 months.

 Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $6.2 million, from $49.5 million during the three-month period ended March 31,2017 to $43.3 million during the three-month period ended March 31,2018. The decrease was mainly

<<<

 attributable to an increased cash outflow of $11.2 million caused by movements in working capital accounts, an increase of $6.8 million in vessel operating and supervision costs, an increase of $4.7 million in cash paid for interest including

<<<

 the interest paid for finance leases, an increase of $2.4 million in voyage expenses and commissions and an increase of $1.9 million in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase of $10.2 million in revenues, an increase

<<<

 of $7.8 million in net pool allocation, a decrease of $1.5 million in realized losses on interest rate swaps held for trading and an increase of $1.5 million in realized gain on forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading.

Net Cash

<<<

 Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $542.8 million, from $18.1 million in the three-month period ended March 31,2017 to $560.9 million in the three-month period ended March 31,2018. The increase

<<<

 is mainly attributable to an increase of $533.7 million in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets, a net increase of $18.0 million in short-term investments and an increase of $4.9 million in restricted cash

<<<

. The above movements were partially offset by a decrease of $13.8 million in payments made for the investment in Gastrade.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $208.1 million, from

<<<

 $274.2 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 to $482.3 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $218.2 million in proceeds from our borrowings and an increase

<<<

 of $33.0 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners' public offering. The above movements were partially offset by an increase in bank loan repayments of $31.5 million, an increase of $7.1 million in dividend payments, an increase of $2.

<<<

5 million in payments of loan issuance costs and an increase of $1.8 million in payments for finance lease liabilities.

 on order for which we have secured time charters. Does not include charter revenues for the vessels operating in the spot/short-term market under the Cool Pool agreement and the Methane Nile Eagle, in which we hold a 25% minority interest.

<<<

 Contracted revenue calculations assume: (a) 365 revenue days per annum, with 30 off-hire days when the ship undergoes scheduled dry-docking (every five years). We have also assumed ten additional off-hire days for the enhancements of three

<<<

 vessels; (b) all LNG carriers on order are delivered on schedule; and (c) no exercise of any option to extend the terms of charters. For time charters that include a fixed operating cost component subject to annual escalation, revenue calculations

<<<

 include that fixed annual escalation. For time charters that give the charterer the option to set the charter hire rate at prevailing market rates during an initial portion of the time charter's term, revenue calculations assume that the charterer

<<<

 does not elect such option. Revenue calculations for such charters include an estimate of the amount of the operating cost component and the management fee component.
(2) Available days represent total calendar days after deducting 30 off-hire

 days when the ship undergoes scheduled dry-docking. We have also assumed ten additional off-hire days for the enhancements of three vessels. The available days for the vessels operating in the spot/short-term market are included.

Other

<<<

 than the assumptions reflected in the footnotes to the table, including our assumption that our newbuildings are delivered on schedule, the table does not reflect events occurring after March 31,2018. The table reflects only our contracted

<<<

 charter revenues for the ships in our owned fleet and bareboat fleet for which we have secured time charters, and it does not reflect the costs or expenses we will incur in fulfilling our obligations under the charters, nor does it include

<<<

 other revenues we may earn, such as revenues for technical management of customer-owned ships. In particular, the table does not reflect any revenues from the five vessels that are operating in the Cool Pool, any additional ships we may acquire

<<<

 in the future, nor does it reflect the options under our time charters that permit our charterers to extend the time charter terms for successive multi-year periods. The entry into time charter contracts for the five vessels that are operating

<<<

 in the Cool Pool and any additional ships we may acquire, or the exercise of options extending the terms of our existing charters, would result in an increase in the number of contracted days and the contracted revenue for our fleet in the

<<<

 future. Although the contracted charter revenues are based on contracted charter hire rate provisions, they reflect certain assumptions, including assumptions relating to future ship operating costs. We consider the assumptions to be reasonable

<<<

 as of the date of this report, but if these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual time charter revenues could differ from those reflected in the table. Furthermore, any contract is subject to various risks, including performance by

<<<

 the counterparties or an early termination of the contract pursuant to its terms. If the charterers are unable or unwilling to make charter payments to us, or if we agree to renegotiate charter terms at the request o f a charterer or if contracts

<<<

 are prematurely terminated for any reason, we would be exposed to prevailing market conditions at the time and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Please see the disclosure under the heading

<<<

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 (Amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data

)

1. Organization and Operations

GasLog Ltd. ("GasLog") was incorporated in Bermuda on July 16, 2003. GasLog and its subsidiaries (the "Group") are primarily engaged in the ownership, operation and management of vessels in the liquefied natural

<<<

 gas ("LNG") market, providing maritime services for the transportation of LNG on a worldwide basis and LNG vessel management services. The Group conducts its operations through its vessel-owning subsidiaries and through its vessel management

<<<

 services subsidiary. The Group's operations are carried out from offices in Piraeus, London, New York, Singapore and Monaco. The registered office of GasLog is Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. GasLog's chairman, Peter

<<<

 G. Livanos, is GasLog's largest shareholder through his ownership of Ceres Shipping Ltd. ("Ceres Shipping"), which controls Blenheim Holdings Ltd. As of March 31,2018, entities controlled by members of the Livanos family, including GasLog's

<<<

 chairman, are deemed to beneficially own approximately 40.12% of GasLog's issued and outstanding common shares. As a result of his ownership of GasLog's common shares, Mr. Livanos can effectively control the outcome of most matters on which

<<<

 GasLog's shareholders are entitled to vote.

As of March 31, 2018, GasLog held a 25.9% interest (including the 2% interest through general partner units) in GasLog Partners LP ("GasLog Partners" or the "Partnership") and, as a result of its

<<<

 ownership of the general partner and the fact that the general partner elects the majority of the Partnership's directors in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, GasLog has the ability to control the Partnership's affairs and policies

<<<

. Consequently, GasLog Partners is consolidated in the Group's financial statements.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of GasLog and its subsidiaries. Unless indicated otherwise

<<<

, the subsidiaries listed below are 100% held (either directly or indirectly) by GasLog. As of March 31,2018, the Group's structure is as follows:

For newbuildings, expected delivery quarters as of March 31, 2018 are presented. (2) On February 24, 2016, GAS-twenty six Ltd. completed the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise

<<<

 with a subsidiary of Mitsui Co. Ltd. ("Mitsui"). Refer to
Note 6. (3) On October 1, 2015, GasLog Carriers, Dynagas Ltd. ("Dynagas") and Golar LNG Ltd. ("Golar") ("Pool Owners") and The Cool Pool Limited signed an LNG
carrier pooling agreement

<<<

 (the "LNG Carrier Pool" or "Pool Agreement") to market their vessels, which are currently operating in the LNG shipping spot market.
As of March 31, 2018, the LNG Carrier Pool - named the "Cool Pool" - consists of 18 modern, high quality and

<<<

 essentially equivalent vessels powered by fuel efficient tri-fuel diesel electric ("TFDE") propulsion technology. The participation of the Pool Owners' vessels in the Cool Pool is as follows: Dynagas: three vessels; GasLog: five vessels; and

<<<

 Golar: ten vessels. Each vessel owner continues to be fully responsible for the staffing and technical management of their respective vessels. For the operation of the Cool Pool, a Marshall Islands service company named "The Cool Pool Limited

<<<

" or the "Pool Manager", was incorporated in September 2015 acting as an agent. (4) On January 12, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for the construction of a 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex LNG Carrier with LP-2S

<<<

 propulsion (Hull No. 2213) that is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020. This vessel will now be the vessel to be chartered to Centrica for an initial period of approximately seven years. The 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex

<<<

 Plus LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2212) to be delivered in the third quarter of 2019 is currently without charter.
2. Basis of Presentation
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance

<<<

 with International Accounting Standard ("IAS") 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). Certain information and footnote disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards

<<<

 ("IFRS") for a complete set of annual financial statements have been omitted, and, therefore, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual consolidated financial statements

<<<

 as of and for the year ended December 31,2017 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018. On May 3, 2018, GasLog's board of directors authorized the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for issuance.
The critical accounting judgments

<<<

 and key sources of estimation uncertainty were disclosed in the Company's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,2017 and remain unchanged.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed

<<<

 in U.S. dollars ("USD"), which is the functional currency of all of the subsidiaries in the Group because their vessels operate in international shipping markets in which revenues and expenses are primarily settled in USD, and the Group's most

<<<

 significant assets and liabilities are paid for and settled in USD.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of derivative financial instruments. The same accounting policies and methods

<<<

 of computation have been followed in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as were applied in the preparation of the Group's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, except for the changes resulting from

<<<

 the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (as discussed below).
Management anticipates that the Group's primary sources of funds will be available cash, cash from operations and borrowings

<<<

 under existing and new loan agreements. The Group may also seek to raise additional common or other forms of equity. Management believes that these sources of funds will be sufficient for the Group to meet its liquidity needs and to comply

<<<

 with its financial covenants for at least twelve months from the end of the reporting period and therefore it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Adoption o f new and revised IFRS
(a) Standards and interpretations

<<<

 adopted in the current period
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenuefrom Contracts with Customers which applies to all contracts with customers: the main exceptions are leases, financial instruments and insurance contracts. IFRS 15 specifies

<<<

 how and when an IFRS reporter will recognize revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. The standard supersedes IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts

<<<

 and a number of revenue-related interpretations. The standard was effective for annual periods beginning or on after January 1,2018 and was applied by the Group using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of the standard as of January

<<<

 1, 2018 resulted in an increase of $246 on the Group's Accumulated deficit and an increase of the same amount on the Group's Other payables and accruals under the modified retrospective approach, as a result of the reassessment of the timing

<<<

 of the performance obligations in relation to positioning and repositioning fees and associated expenses.

F-8

The Group assessed that under a time charter arrangement, the hire rate per the charter agreement has two components: the lease

<<<

 component and the service component relating to the vessel operating costs. The revenue in relation to the lease component of the agreements will be accounted for under the leases standard. The vessel operating expenses include expenses that

<<<

 are paid by the vessel owner such as management fees, crew wages, provisions and stores, technical maintenance and insurance expenses. These costs are essential to operating a charter and the charterers receive the benefit of these when the

<<<

 vessel is used during the contracted time and, therefore, these costs will be accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 Revenuefrom Contracts with Customers.
In relation to short-term charters under the Cool Pool, management

<<<

 believes mobilization of a vessel from a previous port of discharge to a subsequent port of loading does not result in a separate benefit for charterers and that the activity is thus incapable of being distinct. This activity is considered

<<<

 to be a required set-up activity to fulfil the contract. On that basis, it was concluded that positioning and repositioning fees and associated expenses should be recognized over the period of the contract, and not at a certain point in time

<<<

.
In July 2014, the IASB issued the complete version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard requires all financial assets to be

<<<

 subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value depending on the business model of the legal entity in relation to the management of the financial assets and the contractual cash flows of the financial assets. The standard also requires

<<<

 a financial liability to be classified as either at fair value through profit or loss or at amortized cost. In addition, a new hedge accounting model was introduced, that is designed to be more closely aligned with how entities undertake risk

<<<

 management activities when hedging financial and non-financial risk exposures.
When an entity first applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, it may choose as its accounting policy to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 

<<<

39 Financial Instruments, Recognition and Measurement, instead of the requirements in Chapter 6 of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. An entity shall apply that policy to all of its hedging relationships. The Group has selected to apply hedge accounting

<<<

 under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
The Group has elected to take the transition relief as provided by IFRS 9.7.2.15 which permits an entity not to restate prior periods on initial application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and any adjustments

<<<

 to be made in the current year. The adoption of this standard as of January 1,2018 resulted in a decrease of $436 on the Group's Accumulated deficit and an equal decrease on the Group's Reserves, as a result of the change in the accounting

<<<

 for the currency basis element of the cross-currency swaps ("CCSs") to flow directly to the statement of profit or loss.
(b) Standards and amendments in issue not yet adopted

At the date of authorization of these unaudited condensed consolidated

<<<

 financial statements, the following standards and amendments relevant to the Group were in issue but not yet effective:

In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation

<<<

 and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer ("lessee") and the supplier ("lessor"). IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases by lessees as either operating leases or finance leases and, instead, introduces

<<<

 a single lessee accounting model. Applying that model, a lessee is required to recognise: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) depreciation of lease

<<<

 assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the statement of profit or loss. Lessors continue to classify their leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. IFRS 16 supersedes

<<<

 the previous leases Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations. The standard is effective from January 1,2019, with early adoption permitted only with concurrent adoption of IFRS 15 Revenuefrom Contracts with Customers. Management

<<<

 has elected not to adopt early, and it anticipates that the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements, since the changes for lessors are fairly minor and the Group's lessee

<<<

 obligations are not significant.

The impact of all other IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet adopted is not expected to be material on the Group's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

3. Non-controlling Interest

<<<

 in GasLog Partners

On January 17, 2018, GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 4,600,000 8.200% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating Rate Preference Units (the "Partnership's Series B Preference Units"), including

<<<

 600,000 units issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Partnership's Series B Preference Units, at a price to the public of $25.00 per preference unit. The net proceeds from the offering, after

<<<

 deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses, were $111,155. The Partnership's Series B Preference Units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "GLOP PR B".

The profit allocation to non-controlling

<<<

 interests is based on the distribution policy for available cash stated in the Partnership Agreement and is illustrated in the table below:

 three months ended March 31,2018, the net gain of $16,313 derived mainly from the fact that the LIBOR yield curve, which was used to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows, was higher than the agreed fixed interest rates

 resulting in a decrease in net derivative liabilities from interest rate swaps held for trading.
