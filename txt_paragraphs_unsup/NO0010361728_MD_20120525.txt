Rubicon Offshore Holdings Limited Group Management Financial Statements For the three months ended 31 March 2012
Background Rubicon is an offshore oilfield service company focused on the ownership and operation of two floating, production, storage

<<<

 and off-loading vessels ("FPSOs"). Management review Rubicon is pleased to present its latest management report. The Rubicon Intrepid is contracted to the Galoc Production Company for deployment at the Galoc Field, offshore the Philippines

<<<

. During the 1st quarter the FPSO was in Keppel Shipyard, Singapore for the integration of the new turret with the FPSO, as well as to undergo its periodic special survey. These works were completed and the vessel left Singapore on 24 February

<<<

 2012 to return to the Galoc Field, arriving in early March 2012. The operations to hook-up the FPSO to the newly-installed anchor chains and re connect the production riser and umbilical were undertaken during March 2012 and production re commenced

 on 4 April 2012.

The Rubicon Vantage is located at the Bualuang Field, offshore Thailand, where it is contracted to Salamander Energy. The vessel continued to achieve good levels

<<<

 of production uptime which, during the 1st quarter, was 99.8%. Recent events The final cost of completing the turret project for Rubicon Intrepid exceeded the original estimates by some margin, due principally to cost overruns on the offshore

<<<

 installation phases of the project. As a consequence, the Company had insufficient funds to meet the US$15m amortization payment on the US$ bonds due in April 2012. The Company believes that, subject to appropriate terms being agreed, a restructuring

<<<

 of the terms of the bonds would be beneficial for all stakeholders and has therefore entered into discussions with an ad-hoc group of bondholders to explore whether a satisfactory agreement might be reached. Whilst the discussions continue

<<<

, bondholders have agreed to extend the payment date for the US$15m until 15 June 2012. Board of Directors, May 2012
