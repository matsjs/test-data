 DP Producer Callable Bond Issue 2006/2011
(the "Bonds")

Oslo, 25 March 2008
PROPOSAL TO AMEND PRIORITY OF FUNDING AND SECURITY SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the above-captioned Bonds / loan

<<<

 (the "Loan") where DP Producer AS ("DP" / the "Company") is the borrower.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning given to them in the agreement constituting the Loan (the "Loan Agreement") or the summons to the Bondholders

<<<

' meeting unless otherwise stated. The Bondholders being the owners of the Bonds.
NTM has been approached by Bondholders to conduct a Bondholders' meeting. NTM expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to the information in this summons

<<<

.
1. BACKGROUND
Although the board of FPS Ocean, the Issuer, and the Company's financial advisor attempted to address the Company's financial difficulties, no solution was found and the Company entered bankruptcy proceedings in Norway on 20

<<<

 February 2009.
The Bond issue is, inter alia, secured by a second priority mortgage over the vessel the MT Laurita IMO NO 8000616 (the "Vessel") and other equipment pledge.
Mr Ståle Sommernes from Ro & Sommernes (a Norwegian law firm) has been

<<<

 appointed as receivers for the bankruptcy estate. Under Norwegian law, the receivers for the bankruptcy estate may `abandon' assets if he determines that there is no value in such assets for the unsecured creditors. Should the receiver reach

<<<

 this conclusion he will abandon the Vessel back to the Company and the Company will then regain title to and control of the Vessel, subject to the existence of the mortgage and the rights of the Bondholders under it.
The handling of the bankruptcy

<<<

 situation and the subsequent enforcement of the Bondholders' security (including the Vessel mortgage), will result in the incurrence of costs, including legal costs, advisory costs and costs for the preservation of the Vessel.

The Vessel is currently located

<<<

 at the Dubai Dry Dock Yard in Dubai and at present it is taken under arrest by the yard as security of their claim in aggregate approximately $53,618,054.
Legal discussions have taken place between the receivers and the yard who have asserted

<<<

 priority over the mortgagee based on lien provisions in the Civil Transactions Code. In order to protect mortgagee's rights over the Vessel (and to pursue other equipment pledged to the Bondholders which is being retained by the suppliers today

<<<

), and to undertake legal discussions with the yard and the estate, funding will be required to cover legal costs. It can also be expected that certain funding may be required to effect a preservation program for the Vessel, including arrangement

<<<

 of insurance premiums, crewing etc.
2. FUNDING
In order to protect the Bondholders' interests, it is proposed that basic funding be raised in an amount sufficient to meet the above outlined costs (the "Funding"). It is further proposed that

<<<

 the Funding be established on a non-recourse basis to the Bondholders and on a super priority basis ranking prior to the mortgage over the Vessel or any other funds to be paid out to the Bondholders. Repayment to those Bondholders who participate

<<<

 in the Funding (the "Participating Bondholders") shall take place upon revenues received from realization of the Vessel mortgage, equipment or other funds raised for the benefit of the Bondholders (except if such funds are explicitly earmarked

<<<

).
All Bondholders will be given the opportunity to participate in the Funding on equal terms. NTM will keep records of the amount contributed by each Participating Bondholder. If no Funding at all is obtained, Bondholders must be prepared that

<<<

 further investigations as to Bondholders' rights under the mortgage (or other security) and subsequent enforcement may not take place and that the preservation of the Vessel may not continue.
Some Bondholders have confirmed a willingness to

<<<

 offer funding, initially in the amount of up to $50,000, with a redemption premium of 100%. This funding will primarily be used to pay legal fees and related costs incurred in connection with protection of Bondholders' interests. The initial

<<<

 funding of $50,000 may subsequently be increased to a maximum of $150,000.
If a Bondholder wishes to participate in the Funding they will need to evidence their status as a Bondholder to NTM, by providing a letter or screen shot of their holding

<<<

 of Bonds from their custodian bank and state the amount they want to put into the Funding, by 4.00 p.m Oslo time on 3 April 2009 (or such later time as NTM shall determine), assuming that the resolutions are approved.
If more Bondholders want

<<<

 to participate in the Funding than the initial amount set out above, participation will take place on a pro rata basis according to the number of Bonds held by the participating Bondholders, and in case of any discrepancy to the amount
9



<<<

N O R SK TIL L IT SM A N N ASA
Bondholders are entitled to participate for, NTM may resolve such discrepancies in its sole discretion.
NTM does not encourage Bondholders to participate in the Funding, and Bondholders do so entirely at their

<<<

 own risk. NTM shall not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information provided in this summons, or for any losses suffered by Bondholders or any third party as a result of any actions they do or do not take in relation to,

<<<

 or as a result of this summons, in connection with the Funding or otherwise.
In addition to the Funding, legal fees incurred but not paid to the law firms Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham") and Holman Fenwick & Willan ("Holman Fenwick

<<<

") will also be paid out of those received by NTM following a sale of the Vessel or the equipment or otherwise, and prior to any funds paid to the Bondholders. Such fees are estimated to be approximately $20,000 and are not included in the Funding

<<<

 budget.
NTM's handling fee in connection to this Bondholders' meeting and administration of the Funding etc. will also be deducted by the Funding. The fee will be fixed at NOK 35,000.
3. Advisors
It may in future also be necessary to engage

<<<

 a financial advisor and a rig broker (for and on behalf of the Bondholders) (the "Advisors") should it be determined at any stage that this would be in the interests of the Bondholders. Such Advisors will be appointed by the Bondholders' Committee

<<<

 (defined below). Fees for Advisors can be part of the Funding expenses or alternatively it can be paid out prior to any proceeds to Bondholders, however, it will be with second priority out of amounts received by NTM from a sale of the Vessel

<<<

 or the equipment.
4. SPV
As part of the steps to be taken to protect the Bondholders' interests it might be necessary to establish a special purpose vehicle entity (the "SPV") to handle the financial, technical and legal issues which may arise

<<<

. This may be the situation if the bankruptcy estate decides to abandon the Vessel and Bondholders want to take title to the Vessel.
Such SPV, which is not in bankruptcy, has the ability to seek to raise debt or equity finance in order to be

<<<

 in position to undertake the financial, industrial and legal issues and to maximise the opportunity of realising value for Bondholders from the mortgage over the Vessel.
Such SPV may be set up as a new SPV which shall be 100% owned by a trust

<<<

, and for the benefit of the Bondholders. Further legal and financial advisors in addition to management and board of directors may be hired, and the SPV may need further funding.
3

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
If a SPV is established,

<<<

 the Funding may be transferred to the SPV by issuance of notes from the SPV.
5. Bondholders' Committee
In order to manage the Funding and advisors, it is necessary to establish a Bondholders' committee consisting of at least three Bondholder

<<<

 members (the "Committee"). The Committee shall inter aha take control over the Funding budget and allocate the Funding. Bondholders who wish to participate in the Committee should contact NTM three Banking Days prior to the Bondholders' meeting

<<<

 (post@trustee.no). If more than three Bondholders are interested, NTM will determine the makeup of the Committee. If not enough Bondholders wish to participate, the Committee may be smaller, or NTM will seek to appoint Bondholders.
