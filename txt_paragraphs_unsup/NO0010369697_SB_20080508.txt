I.

Background

The Borrower has informed the Loan Trustee that:

1. As previously advised, the Borrower will likely incur substantial overruns on the forecasted capital expenditures to complete

<<<

 the Project and estimates that it will require an additional NOK 350,000,000 to fund the remaining payment obligations arising under the EPC Contract through June of 2008 (the "Funding Requirement").

2. The Borrower intended to meet this Funding

<<<

 Requirement through an equity subscription offering and an offering of a participation in a bridge loan to the Project Company together with warrants (the "April 25 Offerings") that would have closed on 25 April 2008 and 29 April 2008, respectively

<<<

. However, the shareholders' response to the April 25 Offerings would not have ensured the Borrower to raise sufficient additional funding to meet this Funding Requirement and therefore the Borrower decided not to close the April 25 Offerings

<<<

.

3. The Borrower now intends to meet this Funding Requirement through an equity subscription offering comprising a two (2) stage private placement (the "Offerings"), the first stage of which (the "May 13 Offering") would close on 9 May 20

<<<

08 (the period between the date 29 April 2008 and 9 May 2008 being the "Offering Period") and the second stage on or about 13 June 2008. The Borrower will make the Offerings, including the May 13 Offering to both shareholders and warrantholders

<<<

, with warrantholders being treated in all respects in a manner equivalent to, and as if they were, shareholders in the Company.

4. Umoe Invest AS ("Umoe"), the Borrower's largest shareholder, has agreed to underwrite the share offering up

<<<

 to the full amount of the Funding Requirement in the event that the Company cannot raise sufficient funds from other shareholders during the Offering Period. The definition of Change of Control Event and the Change of Control Requirement, however

<<<

, effectively prohibit UMOE from underwriting on this basis because its post money shareholding in the Borrower could increase up to 75.5% - significantly above the 50% ownership level permitted under the definition of Change of Control Event

<<<

 - which would then trigger the Borrower's obligation to offer to purchase the Bonds in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement, defeating the purpose for which UMOE makes this underwriting commitment.

5. The Borrower has been informed

<<<

 that the Project Company will be required to invest up to BRL90 million in various heavy equipment related to the cultivation, harvest, transportation, and processing of sugar cane (the "Heavy Agricultural Equipment"). The Project Company has

<<<

 performed an analysis of the financial arrangements that would be required to obtain the Heavy Agricultural Equipment, including outright purchase, acquisition with loan financing, acquisition through a financial lease, and acquisition through

<<<

 an operating lease. Following comprehensive financial modelling to determine net present value and cashflow impact, the Project Company has determined that financial leases and financing loans secured only by the equipment financed ("Equipment

<<<

 Financing") would be the Project Company's best alternatives to acquire the Heavy Agricultural Equipment. Such Equipment Financing would enhance stakeholder value with acceptable cash outflows over a three year time horizon. Operating leases

<<<

, on the other hand, would be the least attractive proposal, creating less stakeholder value, on a net

-2-

N O RSK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
present value basis, and requiring substantial cash outflows in the initial three years of the operating

<<<

 lease.
6. Although the Borrower would be permitted under the New Indebtedness Restrictions to allow the Project Company to acquire the Heavy Agricultural Equipment through operating leases this would not be in the best economic interest of

<<<

 the Project Company or its stakeholders. The Borrower therefore desires the Project Company to fund the acquisition of the Heavy Agricultural Equipment through Equipment Financing rather than through operating leases. The Borrower believes

<<<

 the acquisition of the Heavy Agricultural Equipment through Equipment Financing would not be of significant importance to the fulfilment by the Borrower of the terms of the Loan Agreement, particularly as the Project Company could obtain operating

<<<

 leases without the Bondholders' consent.

II.

Waiver Solicitation

The Borrower hereby solicits the consent of the Bondholders to:

a. waive the Change of Control Requirement with respect to UMOE's ownership interest in the Borrower, but only

<<<

 on the condition that: (i) the Borrower raise at least NOK 350,000,000 of additional equity as part of the May 13 Offering by the close of the Offering Period, and (ii) UMOE's ownership interest in the Borrower never exceeds 76% of the total

<<<

 issued and outstanding shares of the Borrower from time to time, after the consummation of the May 13 Offering;

b. waive (i) the Event of Default arising out of the Offerings as a result of the Borrower's non-compliance with the Anti-Dilution

<<<

 Requirements and (ii) any right of the Bondholders or the Loan Trustee, for and on behalf of the Bondholders, to require the Borrower to agree with the Loan Trustee a new Exercise Price under the Anti-Dilution Requirements in respect of any

<<<

 non-compliance therewith by the Borrower, but in each case only on condition the Offerings will be made to both shareholders and warrantholders, with warrantholders being treated in all respect in a manner equivalent to, and as if they were

<<<

, shareholders in the Company; and

c. waive the New Indebtedness Restrictions, but only to the extent required to allow the Project Company to utilize Equipment Financing up to an aggregate amount of BRL 90 million to acquire Heavy Agricultural

<<<

 Equipment upon and after the date such waiver is approved.

To enable the Borrower to conduct the proposed change of the Bond Agreement, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider

<<<

 the approval of the proposed changes.

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
According to the information presented by the Borrower there is an urgent cash requirement for the Project to continue. The expansion of the existing distillery and the

<<<

 construction of the second distillery constitute the only projects within the Borrower, and the Project is therefore crucial to the financial future of the Borrower. This emphasises the importance and urgency receiving the waivers to successfully

<<<

 raising the equity / funding. In the Loan Trustee's opinion, the Borrower may benefit from getting Umoe as a dedicated industrial owner which could have a positive effect on the Project going forward. Whether financing of the equipment for

<<<

 cultivation, harvesting, transportation and processing of sugarcane through financial loans and financial leases instead of operational leases is a disadvantage to the Bondholders considering the more favourable terms of the Equipment Financing

<<<

, is left to the individual Bondholder to evaluate. The proposal is put forward without any compensation to the Bondholders, however a similar waiver for the Change of Control Requirements was part of the resolution adopted at the Bondholders

<<<

' meeting held 25 April 2008.

The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
