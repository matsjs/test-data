Director's report
Bluewater Holding B.V. (the ``Company'') is the holding company

<<<

 of a group of companies (together referred to as the ``Group'' or ``Bluewater'' and individually as ``Group entities''), primarily engaged in the supply of services and products to the oil industry. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates

<<<

 floating production storage and offloading units (``FPSOs''), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops and manages the construction of single point mooring systems (``SPMs''). Bluewater has an FPSO fleet consisting

<<<

 of 5 high specification FPSOs that are or will be operated under medium- to long-term service agreements or bareboat charter agreements with reputable oil companies. Currently Bluewater has FPSOs in operation on the UK Continental Shelf.
Business

<<<

 performance The net result after tax for the year 2017 amounted to a profit of U.S.$4.6 million compared to a loss of U.S.$8.5 million for the year 2016. EBITDA for the year 2017 was U.S.$155.7 million compared to U.S.$190.0 million for the

<<<

 year 2016. The financial results of 2017 were mainly impacted by the following items:
The SPM division generated U.S.$35.6 million EBITDA for the year 2017 compared to U.S.$39.2 million EBITDA for the year 2016. In 2017, progress on the running

<<<

 SPM projects are either in design or in final stages, resulting in lower EBITDA recognition compared to the year 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 showed an increase in EBITDA compared to the third quarter of 2017.
The 2017 EBITDA for the FPSO

<<<

 division was U.S.$128.2 million compared to U.S.$160.4 million EBITDA for the year 2016. The U.S.$32.2 million decrease in EBITDA compared to the year 2016 was mainly driven by a U.S.$26.0 million decrease in EBITDA for the FPSO Glas Dowr.

<<<

 This decrease in EBITDA is due to the recognition of the largest part of the termination fee following the termination for convenience by ENI in 2016 compared to the lay-up of the vessel in the year 2017. EBITDA of the FPSO Aoka Mizu reduced

<<<

 by U.S.$10.2 million. FPSO Aoka Mizu stopped production from the Ettrick field on June 1,2016. EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm decreased by U.S.$3.9 million due to lower tariff income in the year 2017 compared to the year 2016 mainly as a result

<<<

 of a planned maintenance shut down in July 2017 and some technical issues in October and November of this year. EBITDA for the FPSO Haewene Brim increased by U.S.$4.6 million compared to the year 2016. This increase was caused by lower credits

<<<

 on the lease in 2017 compared to 2016 following high availability of the FPSO during the reporting period. The company achieved cost savings on the lay-up of the Munin in the year 2017 compared to the year 2016, thereby realizing a U.S.$1.

<<<

2 million EBITDA improvement for the FPSO. Finally FPSO tender costs in the year 2017 decreased by U.S.$2.1 million, despite the increase in number of tender prospects in 2017.
During the year 2017, unallocated expenses amounted to U.S.$8.1

<<<

 million, compared to U.S.$9.6 million for the year 2016. The unallocated expenses for the year 2016 include a reorganization provision of U.S.$0.8 million. The portion unallocated expenses in 2017 was lower than in same period of 2016 despite

<<<

 higher one-off legal, advisory and professional services costs associated with the various amendments of our existing finance facilities and a lower overhead charge as a result of FPSO Aoka Mizu and FPSO Glas Dowr being off contract for the

<<<

 full year. This was compensated by a higher utilisation of engineering and project management staff.
Depreciation and amortization expenditure for the year 2017 amounted to U.S.$107.7 million compared to U.S.$150.7 million for the year 201

<<<

6 which includes the impairment of intangible assets of U.S.$33.1 million. Decommissioning of FPSO Glas Dowr was completed on March 1,2016 and decommissioning of FPSO Aoka Mizu on August 1,2016. As from these dates the FPSOs were classified

<<<

 as `FPSOs held for conversion' and are depreciated on an adjusted depreciation rate after the reassessment of the anticipated useful life. Since August 14, 2017 the Aoka Mizu has been under contract for conversion for the Lancaster project

<<<

 for Hurricane. As of that date the Aoka Mizu has been re-classified from `FPSO held for conversion' to `FPSO under construction'. Management also assessed indications for potential impairment of the intangible assets and other financial investments

<<<

 related to its upstream activities, concluding that for an amount of U.S.$33.1 million of capitalized license fees and other financial investments required impairment in the year 2016 compared to nil in 2017.
3

Finance expenses were U.S.

<<<

$2.0 million lower compared to the previous year, at U.S.$56.3 million versus U.S.$58.3 million for the year 2016. The amendment agreements to the senior secured project finance facility and corporate credit facility have led to one-off additional

<<<

 amortization expenditures of debt arrangement fees of U.S.$1.3 million due to recalculation of the debt arrangement fees over the remainder period of the facilities in 2016. In the third quarter of 2017 an amount of U.S.$4.7 million was added

<<<

 to the debt arrangement fees. These arrangement fees consist of legal, advisory, professional, upfront and commission fees and costs incurred to get in place the overrun finance facility for the Hurricane project of which U.S.$1.8 million was

<<<

 amortized in 2017. The bond interest costs increased with U.S.$1.9 million in 2017 compared with 2016 as a result of quiet enjoyment in favour of Hurricane of the Aoka M izu needed to ensure the Hurricane contract. This increase in bond interest

<<<

 is added to the bond value as payment in kind interest. Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$4.4 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to further reduction of net debt.
Currency exchange results were U.S.$2.3 million negative

<<<

 in the year 2017 compared to U.S.$3.5 million positive in the year 2016. The significant decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling has led to negative exchange results in the year 2017. The currency exchange

<<<

 rate moved from EUR/USD 1.06 and GBP/USD 1.23 at the begin of the year to EUR/USD 1.20 and GBP/USD 1.35 at the end of the year 2017. Because the Company's revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollar and a part of the expenses are in EUR

<<<

 and GBP, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Only in the fourth quarter of the year 2017 there were currency exchange contracts in place, the remainder of the year there were no credit lines.
Income tax

<<<

 benefit for the year 2017 amounted U.S.$14.3 million versus U.S.$5.9 million income tax benefit for the year 2016. The 2016 income tax benefit relates to a U.S.$6.4 million increase in the deferred tax asset and a U.S.$0.5 million tax expense

<<<

 mainly in relation to Glas Dowr withholding tax and Australian corporate tax. The U.S.$14.3 million income tax benefit in 2017 relates to a U.S.$12.7 million increase in the deferred tax asset and the remainder of U.S.$1.6 million mainly relates

<<<

 to refunds as a result of recalculation of Glas Dowr corporate income tax paid in prior years.
Other developments On November 28, 2016, the Company has signed a Heads of Terms with Hurricane Energy, a UK listed oil and gas-company focused on

<<<

 hydrocarbon resources in naturally fractured basement reservoirs, for the use of the Aoka Mizu FPSO on the Lancaster field, West of Shetland. Following the signing of the Agreement, the Company and Hurricane have substantially concluded the

<<<

 second phase FEED study at the end of March, 2017. On April 4, 2017, the bondholders were served with a notice of a written resolution to permit the implementation of the Head of Terms with Hurricane and related bond amendments. On April 1

<<<

1,2017, The Nordic Trustee ASA confirmed that the proposed resolution was passed with the requisite majority of voting bonds voting in favour of the proposed resolution and therefore the bond agreement was changed as set out in the notice. On

<<<

 May 3, 2017, the project finance facility lenders consented to enter into a Hurricane letter of quiet enjoyment and bond coupon increase. Subsequently, Hurricane agreed to authorize the Company to procure long lead items in order to keep the

<<<

 project on schedule to deliver first oil by end of 1H 2019. On June 23, 2017, the Company and Hurricane Energy plc (" Hurricane") reached agreement on the key contracts outlining terms for the upgrade, lease and operation of the FPSO Aoka Mizu

<<<

 (" Transaction Documents'') in connection with the Early Production System on Hurricane's Lancaster Field (``Lancaster EPS''). On June 30, 2017, Hurricane announced a fundraising of U.S.$530.0 million to fund capital expenditure in relation

<<<

 to the Lancaster EPS. The Transaction Documents became effective in accordance with their terms on August 14, 2017.
On June 30, 2017, Repsol Sinopec Resources UK Limited gave notice of extending the firm period of the bareboat charter for FPSO

<<<

 Bleo Holm at unchanged charter terms. The firm contract period now runs up until June 30, 2019.
4

In the SPM Segment, the Company has commenced works for the delivery of 3 buoy systems, with delivery of these buoy systems being expected by

<<<

 Q2 2018.

The corporate facility that was scheduled to mature on December 31,2017 has been extended till March 31, 2018. The availability under the facility is U.S.$5.0 million until a new lender or lenders are found.

Outlook

The outlook

<<<

 for the year 2018 looks promising for the Company. The increase in the oil price and the economic upturn has led to multiple interests in both assets held for conversion as well as for SPM opportunities. We started with paid preparatory studies

<<<

 for these FPSOs. Also the interest of our clients in the SPM segment has significantly increased.

The Company has entered into discussions with its existing and new lenders to arrange a new corporate facility, reflecting the improved market

<<<

 conditions and the performance of the Company. This goes in parallel with the target to refinance the unsecured subordinated bond in prior to its expiry in 2019. The solvability and liquidity improved in 2017 compared to 2016. Furthermore there

<<<

 are no significant changes to be expected in personnel.

Given the current business outlook and the liquidity forecast Bluewater expects to have sufficient funds to continue its operations for at least the coming 12 months. The financial statements

<<<

 have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting.

Risk management Strategic risks: Longer lasting lower crude oil price
In the event that the price of oil should continue to remain low over the long-term, the current industry

<<<

 downturn will be prolonged accordingly and the demand for offshore services may be impacted with cancellation or delay of planned investments and capital expenditures, w it h an ultimate severe effect on Bluewater's new order intake. Although

<<<

 Bluewater's business model allows for a solid and stable cash flow depending on the leased FPSOs contract terms, cost optimization and acquisition of new profitable projects at lower oil prices remain a priority for Bluewater.

Liquidity risks

<<<

:

Access to capital Access to multiple sources of debt funding is necessary in order to ensure new projects and a sustainable growth of Bluewater's FPSO fleet and SPM projects. Failure to obtain such financing could hamper growth for Bluewater

<<<

 and ultimately prevent it from taking on new projects and could adversely affect Bluewater's business, results and financial condition. Bluewater envisages an adequate capital structure and continues to evaluate the various options to attract

<<<

 capital necessary to sustain the current activities of Bluewater in the mid to long term as well as to fund any investments necessary to redeploy the FPSOs for new contracts.

Covenants Financial covenants need to be met with Bluewater's lenders

<<<

. Failure to maintain financial covenants may adversely impact the results and financial condition of Bluewater. The available facilities contain a set of financial covenants. Bluewater aims to have sufficient headroom in relation to the financial

<<<

 ratios. The covenants are monitored continuously, with a 24 months forward horizon. Bluewater will continue to engage with existing and new lenders to, where needed, explore solutions to ensure compliance with the financial covenants. In the

<<<

 case of any anticipated risk impacting the financial condition of Bluewater, Bluewater will engage with the existing and/or new lenders in a timely manner to discuss proposed solutions.

5

Compliance risks: Failures of governance, transparency

<<<

 and integrity Integrity failure could harm severely Bluewater's reputation, finances and business results, and it is of utmost importance across Bluewater's management that such events shall be prevented. Bluewater's Compliance Program provides

<<<

 policy, training, guidance and risk based oversight and control on compliance risk and its components aim to strengthen aware ness and enhance employees' capabilities for ethical decision making. Bluewater's Anti Brib ery & Corruption and Code

<<<

 of Conduct guide employees and business partners on compliant behaviours in line with Bluewater's principles.

Operational risks:

FPSO operations risk and project execution risk With an integrated approach to quality and safety within the

<<<

 Company's offshore operations and projects, the Company achieves high performance with no appetite to harm people or to damage its assets or the environment in the execution in any of its activities. In the normal course of business the Company

<<<

 has to deal with operational risks associated with deadlines and milestones. These deadlines and milestones can be critical to achieve the anticipated end result of a project. To ensure compliance with the agreed deadlines and milestones, larger

<<<

 projects are split up into sub-projects while the smaller projects are coordinated and followed securely. Modern planning techniques are used to define the critical path of the project and possible delays are anticipated upon and resolved within

<<<

 the project. This is also the case with the Hurricane project as Hurricane has committed itself to produce first oil in H1 2019. These milestones are followed with great attention. Risk assessments ensures that milestones and deadlines are

<<<

 met and are in line with forecasts and expectations. Dedicated task forces are allocated in case issues arise at any given time.

Corporate governance In 2016, Bluewater Holding BV constituted a Supervisory Board, comprising of 3 members. Chairman

<<<

 is Mr P.R.M. van Binsbergen. The Supervisory Board is there to advise and supervise the Management of the Company. The Supervisory Board has at least 2 members which are independent within the meaning of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code

<<<

. The Financial Accounting and Supervision Committee remains effective and currently has one member, which is independent within the meaning of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The sole statutory director of the Company is M r H.J. Heerema

<<<

. As of January 27, 2014 the Company is listed on the Nordic ABM and as such no longer classifies as a Public Interest Entity under Dutch law as of this date.

Financial instruments With most of its revenue in US dollars Bluewater is exposed

<<<

 to currency exchange fluctuations. In addition, Bluewater is exposed to the risk of fluctuations of the value of financial instruments due to changes in the market rate of interest. Bluewater uses (in the normal course of business) various

<<<

 types of financial instruments with the objective to minimize these currency and interest rate risks. Procedures and policies are in place to control risks related to financial instruments, including a clear segregation of duties between operating

<<<

, settlement, accounting and controlling of all financial instruments used. Bluewater's management is involved in the risk management process. Bluewater attempts to minimize the counterparty credit risk associated with the financial instruments

<<<

 used by selecting counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy.

Research and development Bluewater focuses its research and development activities on technology that is integrated in our FPSO and SPM businesses. We have an in-house design

<<<

 and engineering team consisting of engineers trained in a number of disciplines. We also access new sources of information or technology by entering into strategic alliances with equipment manufacturers, oil and gas companies, universities

<<<

 or by participating in joint industry programs. While the market for our products and services is subject to continuous technological changes, development cycles from initial conception through introduction can extend over several years. Our

<<<

 efforts have resulted in the development of a number of inventions, new processes and techniques, many of which have been incorporated as improvements to our product lines. Our research and development activity has led to a number of patents

<<<

 or patent applications, principally in the area of SPM systems. During 2017 and 2016, our research and development expenditures were U.S.$0.3 million and U.S.$0.8 million, respectively. We expect to
6

expend similar amounts on research and

<<<

 development in future periods. Hoofddorp, March 9, 2018

Report by the Audit Committee
As of January 1,2017 the Financial Accounting

<<<

 Supervision Committee (``FASC'') has been transformed to the Audit Committee (``AC ``), consisting of one member, who is independent within the meaning of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. As of January 27, 2014 the Company is listed with

<<<

 issued bonds on the Nordic ABM of the Oslo Stock Exchange which is a non EU regulated exchange and as such the company no longer classifies as a Public Interest Entity under Dutch law as of this date.
Activities The AC was involved in performing

<<<

 reviews focused on operations, risk management, internal controls and financial reporting. All these reviews are focused on whether sufficient checks and balances are in place and working in order to have consistent overview on the Company

<<<

's activities and the related reliable financial reporting outcomes. Particular attention was paid to the Company's risks in relation to large contracts and projects, including project management, legal and finance. Other activities of the year

<<<

 included Operations, ICT and Enterprise Risk Management, the Company's policies with regard to anti-bribery and corruption (ABC policy) and compliance in general with rules and regulations. The AC also exchanged information about its activities

<<<

 and findings with Deloitte, the Company's external auditors and had separate meetings with the auditors, without the Company's management presence, in order to facilitate free and open discussions. Furthermore, the AC attended meetings in which

<<<

 the audit plan, management letter and final audit findings were discussed. Specific accounting issues and tax positions of the Company were on the agenda. The AC reports to the shareholder of the company.
Governance and risks The Company has

<<<

 an Enterprise Risk Management system in place to ensure adequate monitoring of performance and risks. One of the main risks is not being compliant with rules and regulations and the ABC policy. Also during 2017 this has been a key-area of attention

<<<

, including the possible advanced ICT threats. Management believes that measures taken and planned are adequate to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which the Company operates. The AC is actively involved

<<<

 in monitoring the adherence to the ABC policy as well as in evaluating the risk assessment process in general and in setting priorities.
Future developments The AC will continue to critically assess the Company's risks and controls in order

<<<

 to monitor the strength of risk management. Additionally the AC will continue to closely monitor the Company's efforts in enhancing control activities around strategy, financing the Company and refining the loans, reemployment of the assets

<<<

 (long term contracts FPSO's), project management, lessons learned, compliance with rules and regulations and compliance with ABC legislation. The AC encourages management in its efforts to strengthen the governance structure of the Company

<<<

 and to implement new activities, such as the improvement of the internal ABC control system and the introduction of external independent audits on foreign agents, to further mitigate industry specific risks.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. General information
Reporting entity Bluewater Holding B.V. (the " Company") is domiciled in the Netherlands. The address of the Company's

<<<

 registered office is Taurusavenue 46, 2132 LS Hoofddorp. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended December 30, 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ``Group'' or

<<<

 ``Bluewater'' and individually as ``Group entities'') and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities. The Group is primarily engaged in the supply of services and products to the oil industry. The Company's immediate parent is Bluewater

<<<

 Offshore Production Systems Ltd. The Company's next most senior parent that issues consolidated financial statements is Aurelia Energy N.V., Willemstad (Curasao). The Company is ultimately wholly owned by Aurelia Holding N.V., Willemstad (Curasao

<<<

), of which all shares are ultimately held by the Jacaranda Trust, an irrevocable discretionary trust constituted under the laws of Jersey.
Activities Bluewater is a specialized service provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry

<<<

. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates floating production storage and offloading units (``FPSOs''), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops and performs project management and constructs single point

<<<

 mooring systems (``SPMs'').
An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either newly built or converted tankers upon which production

<<<

 equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and water) are processed on board the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported to an off take system ut ilizing shuttle tankers. Bluewater's fleet of FPSOs is involved

<<<

 in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- and long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts.
SPMs are used to transfer fluids to and from

<<<

 a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker while securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. Most SPMs consist of an anchoring system that is connected to the ocean floor and a fluid transfer system

<<<

 that permits the transfer of fluids between fixed and rotating parts of the mooring system. SPMs are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors.
Revenues are earned from day rates consisting of a fixed facility fee

<<<

 and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases with oil companies, supplemented from time to time with fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from

<<<

 the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed.
FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial design and engineering phase to final installation.

2. Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Bluewater has decided not to early adopt the new standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition and IFRS 16 Leases. Other new standards

<<<

 and amendments have been published by the IASB but have not been endorsed yet by the European Commission. Early adoption is not possible until European Commission endorsement. Those relevant to Bluewater are set out below:
IFRS 9 - Financial

<<<

 Instruments This Standard includes requirements for the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.

<<<

 This standard will be mandatory as of January 1,2018. Bluewater is analyzing the impacts and practical consequences of these standard's future application. It is expected that the main impact will relate to the new impairment model whereby

<<<

 impairment of the financial assets are based on a current expected credit losses model.
IFRS 15 - Revenue Recognition The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. This will replace IAS 18 which covers contracts for goods

<<<

 and services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts. This standard specifies how and when an IFRS reporter will recognize revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant

<<<

 disclosures. The standard provides a single, principles based fivestep model to be applied to all contracts with customers. This standard will be mandatory as of January 1,2018. Bluewater is analysing the impacts and practical consequences

<<<

 of these standard's future application. The preliminary analysis of the existing contracts demonstrates that the construction contract represents one performance obligation and the progress-based measurement of revenue will still be the main

<<<

 method used by Bluewater for the construction contracts. The lease contracts are not impacted by IFRS 15 as they are covered by IFRS 16. For the operating and maintenance contracts no major changes are anticipated. A detailed assessment will

<<<

 be made on a contract by contract basis and the impact of the standard will only become clear when the terms and conditions of these contracts are known (some of 2018 revenues will be based on contracts that are currently not existing).
IFRS

<<<

 16 -- Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. This standard specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets

<<<

 and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16's approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged

<<<

 from its predecessor, IAS 17. The accounting for contracts where Bluewater is the lessor is expected to be unchanged. Bluewater has a number of lease contracts for land and buildings and instalment vessel that are currently accounted for under

<<<

 IAS 17 as operating leases. The following changes are expected upon transition to IFRS 16:
- Assets and liabilities are expected to increase by an amount close to the net present value of future lease payments.
- Earnings before interest, taxes

<<<

, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) will increase as the lease payments will be presented as depreciation and finance cost rather than operating expenses.
- Operating cash flow will increase and investing and financing cash flow will decrease

<<<

 as the lease payments will no longer be considered as operational. Bluewater will continue to analyze the impacts and practical consequences of these standard's future application. The new standard f or leases is effective January 1,2019.
Other

<<<

 new or revised accounting standards are not considered to have a material impact on Bluewater's consolidated financial statements.
15

3. Significant accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently

<<<

 to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities.

(a)

Statement of compliance

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International

<<<

 Financial Reporting

Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations adopted and endorsed by the European Union.

(b)

Basis of preparation

These consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, which is Bluewater's

functional

<<<

 currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The

consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial

instruments that are stated at fair

<<<

 value, as explained in the accounting policies below.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and

<<<

 the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the

<<<

 period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

In particular, significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts

<<<

 recognized in the financial statements are:

 Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned with the FPSOs, which along with

<<<


the discount rate, is the basis for the recoverable amounts of FPSOs;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forward;  Potential impact of claims and litigation.

Considerations for preparation of the 2017 financial statements

<<<



Given the current business outlook and the liquidity forecast, Bluewater expects to be in compliance with its covenants under the existing loan agreements (including the Corporate Facility, the Project Finance Facility and the Bond Loan) and

<<<

 to have sufficient funds to continue its operations for at least the coming 12 months. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting.

(c)

Basis of consolidation

The financial information relating

<<<

 to Bluewater Holding B.V. is presented in the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with article 2:402 of the Dutch Civil Code, the company financial statements only contain an abridged income statement. The consolidated financial

<<<

 statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities (including structured entities) controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries.

(i)

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists

<<<

 when the Group has the power to govern the

financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control,

potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account. The

<<<

 financial statements of

subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until

the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to

<<<



align them with the policies adopted by the Group.

16

(ii)

Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group

transactions, are eliminated

<<<

 in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

(d)

Foreign currency

(i)

Foreign currency transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at

exchange

<<<

 rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign

currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The

resulting exchange gains and

<<<

 losses are recorded under financial income and expense in the consolidated

statement income and comprehensive income, except where hedge accounting is applied.

(ii)

Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are

<<<

 translated into US dollars at exchange rates at the reporting

date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into US dollars at exchange rates at the

dates of the transactions. Gains and losses resulting from the translation

<<<

 are recorded in shareholder's equity,

as translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the

translation reserve is transferred to consolidated income statement.

Foreign exchange gains

<<<

 and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation

<<<

 and are recognized directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.

(e)

Financial instruments

(i)

Non-derivative financial instruments

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity

<<<

 securities, trade and other receivables,

cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.

Non-derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through

<<<

 profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts

<<<

 that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

Available-for-sale financial assets The Group's

<<<

 investments in equity securities are classif ied as available-for-sale financial assets. Listed equity investments are stated at fair value. Since there is no way of reliably measuring the fair value using valuation techniques for some of these

<<<

 investments that are unlisted, these unlisted investments are stated at historical cost less any identified impairment losses. Changes in the fair value of the equity investments are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated

<<<

 in the investment revaluation reserve. When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve is reclassified to other comprehensive income.

Other Other

<<<

 non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

17

(ii)

Derivative financial instruments

Financial instruments at fair value through consolidated income

<<<

 statement

Bluewater uses derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate

caps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.

Such financial instruments

<<<

 are initially recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. Changes in the derivative instrument's fair value are recognized in consolidated income statement, unless specific

<<<

 hedge accounting criteria are met. All derivative financial instrument valuations are determined in part by reference to published price quotations in an active market. These quotations consist of currency exchange rates, interest rates, and

<<<

 discount rates. Attributable transaction costs are recognized in consolidated income statement when incurred.

Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized directly

<<<

 in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognized in consolidated income statement.

If the hedging

<<<

 instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity remains there until

<<<

 the forecasted transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non financial asset, the amount recognized in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognized. In other cases the amount recognized in equity is transferred

<<<

 to consolidated income statement in the same period that the hedged item affects the consolidated income statement.

(iii)

Share capital

Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to

<<<

 the issue of ordinary shares

and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

Dividends The terms and conditions of the current corporate credit facility prohibit the payment of dividends.

(f)

Property

<<<

, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The

<<<

 cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, borrowing costs paid during construction and attributable

<<<

 overhead.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item only if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its

<<<

 cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the consolidated income statement as incurred.

When parts of

<<<

 an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is recognized in the consolidated income statement on a straight

<<<

-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment, taking into account its residual value. Depreciation of assets starts when they are available for their intended use.

18

The estimated useful

<<<

 lives for the categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

 hulls

20-25 years

 swivel stack

15 years

 machinery andprocess equipment

3-10 years

(In case of long-term contracts greater than 10 years, these items are

<<<

 fully depreciated over the contract

duration. For shorter term contracts, a decision is made as to the applicable useful life).

 office equipment

4 years

 other

4-10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed

<<<

 at each reporting date. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized net within

<<<

 the consolidated income statement.

(g)

Intangible assets

(i)

Research and development

Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical

knowledge and understanding, is recognized in

<<<

 the consolidated income statement when incurred.

Development expenditure is capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or

process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable

<<<

, and the Group intends

to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure

capitalized includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrowing costs paid during development and

attributable

<<<

 overhead costs.

Capitalized development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis from the date

<<<

 they are available for use, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets not exceeding 20 years.

(ii)

Oil production licences and field development costs

Capitalized expenditures related to the acquisition of oil production licenses

<<<

 and field developments are

measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is

recognized in the consolidated income statement from the date the field starts production as the related oil and

<<<



gas reserves are produced under the unit of production method. Field development costs are capitalized in

accordance with IFRS 6.

(iii)

Software costs

Capitalized expenditures related to the acquisition and development of software are

<<<

 measured at cost less

accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized in the consolidated

income statement from the date the software is available for use, over the estimated useful lives of the

software

<<<

 of 5 years.

(h)

Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production

<<<

 or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal

<<<

 operating capacity.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
19

(i)

Construction contracts

Construction contracts are measured

<<<

 at cost plus profit recognized to date less progress billings and recognized

losses. Cost includes all expenditure related directly to specific projects and an allocation of fixed and variable

overheads incurred in the Group's contract activities

<<<

 based on normal operating capacity.

If payments received from customers exceed the income recognized, then the difference is presented under deferred income in the consolidated statement of financial position.

(j)

Impairment

The carrying

<<<

 amounts of financial assets and assets that are subject to amortization or depreciation are

reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such

indication exists, then the asset's recoverable

<<<

 amount is estimated.

For intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is

estimated at each reporting date.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater

<<<

 of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (the ``cash-generating unit '').

An impairment

<<<

 loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods

<<<

 are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, except for assets with indefinite useful lives.

(k)

Employee benefits

(i)

Defined contribution plans

Obligations for contributions to defined

<<<

 contribution pension plans in the United Kingdom are recognized as an

employee benefit expense in the consolidated income statement when they are due. Prepaid contributions are

recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a

<<<

 reduction in future payments is available.

(ii)

Defined benefit plans in the Netherlands

Provisions for pension obligations are established for benefits payable in the form of retirement and surviving

dependant pensions. The funds are valued

<<<

 every year by professionally qualified independent actuaries. The

obligations and costs of pension benefits are determined using the projected unit credit method. The projected

unit credit method considers each period of service as giving

<<<

 rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and

measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.

The pension obligation is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate that is similar

<<<

 to the interest rate of Dutch bonds, where the currency and terms of the bond are consistent with the currency and estimated terms of the defined benefit obligation.

The liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position

<<<

 in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets.

Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes

<<<

 to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in employee benefits reserve in other comprehensive income

<<<

 in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
20

(l)

Provisions

A provision is

<<<

 recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation

that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits w ill be required to settle

the obligation. Provisions

<<<

 are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that

reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. No

provision for the costs of demobilization of FPSOs

<<<

 at the end of the lease period is accounted for, if the lease

contract provides for reimbursement of such costs by the lessee.

(m)

Revenue

(i)

Service agreements and/or operating lease arrangements for FPSOs

Revenues under service agreements

<<<

 and/or lease arrangements are recognized when the FPSO is made

available to the lessee and the fee is due in accordance with the lease contract. Income under the lease

agreements for the FPSOs comprises, depending on the vessel, the following

<<<

:

 A facility fee representing a prescribed fee for the lease period. This fee may be increased or decreased based on actual availability of the FPSO, including an allowance for planned maintenance downtime, versus pre-determined thresholds

<<<

.
 A production tariff. This fee depends on actual produced quantities.  A fee for operating the FPSO.

Where applicable, lease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimal non-cancellable lease term.

(ii)

Construction

<<<

 contracts

Contract revenue from construction (design, engineering and project management) of SPMs and auxiliary

equipment includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work, claims and

incentive payments

<<<

 to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably.

As soon as the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses

are recognized in the consolidated

<<<

 income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract.

The stage of completion is measured by the labour and material cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated labour and material cost for each contract, unless the

<<<

 physical progress significantly differs. When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognized only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss

<<<

 on a contract is recognized immediately in the consolidated income statement.

(n)

Government grants

Government grants that compensate Bluewater for expenses incurred are recognized in the consolidated

income statement on a systematic basis

<<<

 in the same periods in which the expenses are recognized, provided

there is reasonable assurance that Bluewater will comply with the conditions attached to the grant and the

grants will be received.

(o)

Finance income and expenses

Finance

<<<

 income comprises interest income on funds invested, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair

value through the consolidated income statement and gains on hedging instruments that are recognized in the

consolidated income statement

<<<

. Interest income is recognized as it accrues in the consolidated income

statement, using the effective interest method.

Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, changes in the fair

<<<

 value of financial assets at fair value through the consolidated income statement, impairment losses recognized on financial assets and losses on hedging instruments that are recognized in the consolidated
21

income statement. Borrowing costs

<<<

 are recognized in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest method, except for borrowing costs that qualify for capitalization. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

(p)

Income tax

The income

<<<

 tax charge is based on the tax regime applicable to the various group companies in the countries in

which they are legally seated. These tax regimes charge income taxes based on operating profits or on the

basis of other criteria as agreed

<<<

 upon by the Group in specific tax rulings. Deferred taxation is considered in

accounting for the income tax charge for the year.

Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet method. Deferred income taxes are provided

for

<<<

 temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the

consolidated financial statements. Future tax benefits attributable to these differences, if any, are recognized to

the extent that realization

<<<

 of such benefits is probable.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or

substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years

<<<

.

4. Financial risk management
In the normal course of business Bluewater uses various types of financial instruments based on financial policies and procedures as agreed by Bluewater's management. Financial instruments, other than derivatives

<<<

, comprise accounts receivable, cash, deposits, long-term and short-term loans and accounts payable. Bluewater also uses derivative transactions; including principally forward rate currency contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps

<<<

, with the purpose to manage the interest and currency risk arising from Bluewater's operations and sources of finance.
Bluewater has procedures and policies in place to control risks related to financial instruments. These policies and procedures

<<<

 include a clear segregation of duties between operating, settlement, accounting and controlling of all financial instruments used. The spread of Bluewater's activities limits the exposure to concentrations of credit or market risk. Bluewater

<<<

's management is involved in the risk management process. Bluewater attempts to minimize the counterparty credit risk associated with the financial instruments used by selecting counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy.
Credit risk

<<<

 The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. Bluewater attempts to minimize its credit risk as much as possible by thoroughly reviewing risks associated with contracts and negotiating

<<<

 bank or parent company guarantees from customers. Additionally, milestone payments are negotiated on lump-sum contracts and outstanding receivables are actively managed in order to minimize the number of days outstanding.
Liquidity risk Bluewater

<<<

 has organized its liquidity management centrally, in order to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable

<<<

 losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
Currency risk Bluewater is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities. Bluewater uses

<<<

 forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk. When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
Interest rate risk Bluewater's exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is mitigated by entering into

<<<

 interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
22

Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return to stakeholders through the

<<<

 optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the shareholder of Bluewater. The Group

<<<

's goal is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Management monitors the capital structure and return on capital, including the cost of

<<<

 capital and the associated risks.

5. Non-IFRS financial performance measures Bluewater uses certain non-IFRS financial performance measures in its financial statements and for the calculation of certain financial covenant ratios as required

<<<

 under its financing agreements. The definitions and calculation of some of these non-IFRS financial performance measures are as follows:

EBITDA: defined as operating result before depreciation, amortization, finance expense and taxes.

Interest

<<<

 bearing debt: defined as the amended corporate credit facility net of debt arrangement fees plus the senior secured project finance facility net of debt arrangement fees and debt service reserve account plus the unsecured subordinated bond

<<<

 net of debt arrangement fees and debt service reserve account.

6. Segment information
The disclosure of segment information is consistent with the internal reports in order to assess each segment

<<<

's performance and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments since Bluewater's risks and rates of return are affected primarily by differences in services and products produced. Additionally information

<<<

 is reported geographically.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly head office expenses, investments

<<<

 and related revenue and income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues. The presentat ion of revenues by geographical segments is determined by the client's country of domicile. No revenues

<<<

 were generated and no assets are located in the Company's country of domicile.

 for financial statement purposes differs from the statutory tax rate, mainly because Bluewater is subject to taxation in various countries with different statutory tax rates and taxable results vary in the various countries involved. Additionally

, some group companies have significant tax losses carried forward, for which no (full) deferred tax asset is recognized. Consequently, Bluewater's taxable result may differ from the operating result.

Based on current business performance as

 well as recent agreements and ongoing negotiations with customers for the deployment of FPSOs, Bluewater expects to generate sufficient profits in the coming years to recover the deferred tax assets.

The deferred tax asset relate to the group companies in the Netherlands. The tax loss carry-forwards in the Netherlands result primarily from the amortization of goodwill and interest expense on intercompany debt. Additionally, the

 tax loss carry-forward increased due to operational losses in prior years. Due to the transfer of the vessels from the Curacao NV's to Dutch BV's a tax rejuvenation will take place. The book result on this transfer will be compensated by Tax

 Losses Carried Forward in the current fiscal year while a higher tax book value will generate higher depreciation in the future. Bluewater has analysed the future realization of the remaining losses carried forward as well as the temporary

 difference in book value, considering Bluewater's history of earnings, projected earnings based on current contracts as well as future contracts, the applicable tax rate, the new rules regarding limitation of deductibility of interest and the

 the EPC budget. The facility will be available till the sailaway date of FPSO Aoka Mizu. The amounts of a proposed advance must be a minimum amount of U.S.$1.0 million and will not be more than the EPC overrun amount. Repayment of the loan

<<<

 shall be by consecutive quarterly instalments, the first of which shall be on the date falling 3 months after First Oil. In case the facility is not used the commitment fee is 2.5% per annum. The amount of overdraft facility as per December

<<<

20. Employee benefits
The group companies in the Netherlands provide a defined benefit pension plan for all its employees. Following the changes in the fiscal and legal legislation in the Netherlands as per January 1,2018, Bluewater implemented

<<<

 certain changes to the pension plan as of this date. Under the adjusted pension plan the employees are entitled to post-retirement yearly instalments amounting to 1.83% of average salary in excess of a deductible of approximately EUR 14.0 thousand

<<<

 and up to a maximum of approximately EUR 81.0 thousand, for each year of service until retirement age of 68. The liabilities and expenses arising from the plan are as follows:

(15,153) (18,348)

The plan is subject to the regulations as stipulated in the Pensions Act (in Dutch: `Pensioenwet'). In

<<<

 the Pensions Act the plan needs to be fully funded and needs to be operated outside Bluewater by a separate legal entity. The plan has been insured by a third-party insurance company. Consequently, most of the risks associated with the plan

<<<

 have been transferred to this third-party insurance company and the funding requirements are determined by the third-party insurance company. The insurance company guarantees that all pension entitlements that have been accrued until December

<<<

 30, 2017 are paid to the pension plan participants and is responsible for operating the plan in accordance with the pension agreement. The insurance company is also responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets. The plan assets

<<<

 are deemed to be equal to the accrued pensions and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan assets is equal to the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation. Bluewater has no additional responsibilities

<<<

 for the governance of the pension plan. The risks associated with
33

the plan that remain with Bluewater are limited to salary risk, risk of individual value transfers and the risk of default by the insurance company.

The majority of our indebtedness consists of advances under our senior secured project finance facility, the am ended corporate facility and our unsecured subordinated bond. W e expect that

(434,635) (77,268)

(515,232) (20,043)

Under the

<<<

 documentation of the senior secured project finance facility, Bluewater is required at any time to have financial instruments in place to mitigate the interest risk to at least 75% of the total amount outstanding under the facility. To this

<<<

 end, Bluewater entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap, thereby fixing the interest on the facility including margin at 4.9125%. The interest rate swap is effective starting August 28, 2013 until February 28, 2018.

Fair value sensitivity

<<<

 analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial liabilities at fair value through the consolidated income statement, and the Group does not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair

<<<

 value hedge accounting model. Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the consolidated income statement.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Interest sensitivity will remain for

<<<

 the amended corporate credit facility. However at December 30, 2017 the outstanding balance is nil. A change of 50 basis points in interest rates compared to the interest rates at the reporting date would therefore have no effect on the consolidated

<<<

 income statement.

Fair values versus carrying amounts The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from the carrying amounts, except for the fair value of the unsecured subordinated U.S.$401.9 million bond

<<<

, which amounts to U.S.$406.4 million as per December 30, 2017.

Bluewater uses the following fair value hierarchy for financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position: the fair value

<<<

 of financial assets that are traded on an active liquid market are determined with reference to the quoted market price (level 1), fair values of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are based on quotes from

<<<

 banks (level 2). Bluewater does not use pricing models to determine fair values (level 3).

24. Operating leases Leases as lessee Annual lease obligations entered into with third parties in connection with building and office space and cars

<<<

, extending through fiscal year 2029, amount to a total of U.S.$38,379 in 2017 (2016: U.S.$36,530). Operational lease expenses in 2017 amounted to U.S.$3,769 (2016: U.S.$4,361).

Basis for our opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards

<<<

 are further described in the ``Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section of our report.
We are independent of Bluewater Holding B.V. in accordance with the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants

<<<

 bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedrags

<<<

- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

 addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, the annual accounts contain other information that consists of:

o

o

Other Information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code

48


<<<


Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:

o

Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements.

o

Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2

<<<

 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements

<<<

.

By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit

<<<

 of the financial statements.

Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the Director's Report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and the other information as required by Part

<<<

 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

DESCRIPTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and

<<<

 fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation

<<<

 of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going

<<<

 concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations

<<<

, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.
The supervisory board is

<<<

 responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient

<<<

 and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud

<<<

 or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature,

<<<

 timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance

<<<

 with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.:

o

Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to

fraud or error, designing

<<<

 and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit

evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a

material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher

<<<

 than for one resulting from error, as fraud may

involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

49

o

Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order

<<<

 to design audit procedures

that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the

effectiveness of the company's internal control.

o

Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used

<<<

 and the reasonableness of accounting

estimates and related disclosures made by management.

o

Concluding on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether

<<<

 a material uncertainty exists related to events or

conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we

conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in

<<<

 our auditor's report to

the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our

opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.

However

<<<

, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

o

Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the

disclosures.

o

Evaluating whether the financial

<<<

 statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a

manner that achieves fair presentation.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit

<<<

. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities

<<<

 for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.

We communicate with both management and the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of

<<<

 the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified during our audit.

We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements

<<<

 regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
