BLUEWATER HOLDING B.V. | RE-ENGAGEMENT OF AO K A MIZU - NOTICE OF WRITTEN RESOLUTIONS

1.

INTRODUCTION

Nordic Trustee ASA, formerly known as Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders

<<<

") in the above-mentioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") of USD 400 million issued by Bluewater Holding B.V. ("Bluewater" or the "Issuer") and guaranteed by its parent Aurelia Energy N.V. (the "Parent") and various subsidiaries

<<<

.

The Bond Issue is regulated by the bond agreement entered into between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee on 9 December 2013 as amended and restated on 14 February 2017 (the "Bond Agreem ent"). Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined

<<<

The Bond Truste has been informed by the Issuer that the matters described below have been discussed between the Issuer and an ad hoc committee of Bondholders holding more

<<<

 than 2/3 o f the Outstanding Bonds (the "Com m ittee"), who have indicated their support for the propsals contained herein.

The inform ation in this summons regarding the Issuer and the described transactions and the proposal set out in Section

<<<

2. BACKGROU N D
2.1 H eads o f Terms w ith Hurricane
The Issuer specialises in the design, development, leasing and operation of floating production, storage and offloading ("FPSO") systems as well as being a provider of single point mooring

<<<

 systems. Despite the headwinds the Group has faced during the recent downturn in the oil and gas market, it has been and continues to be engaged in discussions focused on securing new contracts as well as achieving extensions of existing contracts

<<<

.
On 29 November 2016, after several months of negotiations, it was announced that Bluewater Energy Services B.V. ("Bluewater Energy Services") had reached agreement on heads o f terms ("Heads o f Terms") with Hurricane Energy pic for entering

<<<

 into:
(i) a bareboat charter contract (the "Bareboat Charter") for the use o f the vessel "Aoka Mizu" on the Lancaster field, West of Shetland, to be entered into between the Existing Owner (as defined below) as owner and Hurricane Energy Pic

<<<

 and/or a designated subsidiary within the Hurricane Energy Pic group ("H urricane") as charterer in respect of the Aoka Mizu and which (at the same time as a transfer of title of the Aoka Mizu by the Existing Owner to the New Owner (as defined

<<<

 below)) is to be novated by the Existing Owner to the New Owner;
(ii) an engineering, procurement and construction contract (the "EPC Contract") to be entered into between Bluewater Energy Services or another Group Company (as applicable, the

<<<

 "EPC Contractor") and Hurricane, under which the EPC Contractor agrees to perform the upgrade works that are necessary to enable Aoka Mizu to achieve first oil and render the FPSO suitable for processing hydrocarbons for a period o f ten years

<<<

 ("Upgrade Work"), which will be financed by Hurricane in an amount up to USD 300 million;
(iii) a production, operating and services agreement (the "POSA") to be entered into between Hurricane and a company to be incorporated by Bluewater Energy

<<<

 Services or an affiliate thereof;
(iv) a general first priority (or second priority to the extent the lenders of the Overdraft Facility (as defined below) require first priority (or vice versa in respect of any period if agreed by Hurricane

<<<

 and such lenders)) security assignment in favour of Hurricane, or a security trustee for Hurricane and the lenders under the Overdraft Facility, o f all the contracts entered into in connection with the Upgrade Work, and certain insurances

<<<

, and on substantially the same principles described in Annex 2 of the QEL (the "Hurricane Assignment");
(v) a second priority mortgage (or, if no mortgage is granted to the lenders under the Overdraft Facility, a first priority mortgage) over

<<<

 the Aoka Mizu in favour of Hurricane and on substantially the same principles described in Annex 1 of the QEL (the "Mortgage");
(vi) a letter of quiet enjoyment from the Bondholders in favour of Hurricane substantially in the form attached

<<<

 to this summons as Schedule A (the "QEL"); and

(vii) certain other related agreements (together with the agreements mentioned above, the "Agreements").
Pursuant to the Heads of Terms, each party has granted the other an exclusive right to

<<<

 enter into the Agreements to which both are parties. The exclusivity restrictions placed on both parties will gradually be released until expiry of the exclusivity period at the end o f November 2017.
In consideration for the exclusivity undertakings

<<<

 granted by Bluewater Energy Services, Hurricane has committed to pay the sum of USD 500,000 per month from execution of the Heads of Terms until the termination or expiry o f the Heads of Terms, provided that no sums shall be payable if the

<<<

 Agreements are executed, the condition precedents are fulfilled and the project proceeds.
The parties intend to execute the Agreements during April 2017. The Agreements (including the QEL) will become effective upon fulfilment or waiver of

<<<

 certain conditions precedents by no later than 30 November 2017, including (i) Hurricane's expected internal approval of the project mid-2017, (ii) Hurricane obtaining financing for the development of the project and (iii) obtaining all relevant

<<<

 regulatory approvals required for the project. Contract obligations under the Bareboat Charter and EPC Contract will commence upon such effectiveness and the operating and maintenance obligations under the POSA will start as of first oil.
Hurricane

<<<

 has the right to terminate the Bareboat Charter and POSA for convenience subject to serving a three (3) months prior written notice during the period of three (3) years from first oil and a six (6) months prior written notice during the two

<<<

 subsequent option periods o f 3 years and 4 years respectively, all subject to payment of an early termination fee (the "ETF"). The principal amount o f the ETF is USD 56 million, but the calculation of the final ETF amount is subject to adjustment

<<<

 mechanisms taking the remaining contracting period into consideration.
Hurricane will build up and maintain reserve amounts from receipts of crude oil sales (after operating expenditure, capital expenditure and payments to lenders) to cover

<<<

 its liability to meet the ETF. Hurricane will also build up and maintain an escrow bank account up to the maximum amount of USD 18.67 million accruing evenly across the period during the three (3) years from first oil and will for each subsequent

<<<

 option period build up and maintain a bank account in the name of Hurricane with amounts accruing evenly across the period.
Moreover, under the Heads of Terms, Bluewater Energy Services has accepted to use all reasonable endeavours to deliver

<<<

 on certain requests from Hurricane as described in more detail in Section 2.3 (Bluewater undertaldngs pursuant to the Heads o f Terms) below. This includes a request for the QEL to be entered into by the Bond Trustee (subject to the approval

<<<

 from the Bondholders o f the Proposed Resolution (as defined below)), and to provide the confirmations and undertaldngs as set out therein. The form of the proposed QEL is attached hereto as Schedule A.
3

2.2 Business rationale The Agreements

<<<

 will secure cash flow to the Group for a minimum of three years and potentially up to ten years or more, which will strengthen the Group's financial position and contribute to the Group's ability to continue to meet its operational and financial

<<<

 obligations. The entry into the EPC Contract will also lead to the Aoka Mizu being upgraded to the newest and highest specification FPSO vessel in the Group's fleet and will be financed through a contribution of capex from Hurricane in an amount

<<<

 up to USD 300 million. In addition the entry into of the Charter will save the Group substantial lay-up costs in the conversion period. The EPC Contract will allow the Group to increase utilisation of its engineering and project management

<<<

 staff as well as deploying and monetising its proprietary turret technology.
For further information on the business plan for Aoka Mizu, please see attached presentation included as Schedule B hereto.
2.3 Bluew ater un dertakings pursuant to

<<<

 th e H eads o f Terms As an undertaking in the Heads of Terms, Bluewater Energy Services has accepted to use all reasonable endeavours to procure the performance of the following requests from Hurricane:
2.3.1 Re-Domiciliation o fAoka Mizu

<<<


A t the time of the entry into of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer was contemplating the re domiciliation of certain Vessels, including the Aoka Mizu, from Curasao to the Netherlands, to Bluewater (Aoka Mizu) B.V, which is already a subsidiary

<<<

 gurantor under the Bonds.
Hurricane has requested a sale and transfer of Aoka Mizu from today's owner, Bluewater (Aoka Mizu) N.V., incorporated in Curasao, (the "Existing Owner") to Bluewater (Aoka Mizu) B.V, or another newly incorporated B

<<<

.V. incorporated in the Netherlands (the "New Owner"). Such transfer (the "Re-dom iciliation") is envisaged to be undertaken as soon as reasonably practicable.
The Re-domiciliation is proposed for various business, finance, legal and tax reasons

<<<

, inter alia, in order to retain the ability to utilise tax losses carried forward, which would otherwise expire.
Under Clause 14.1 (Release o f Subsidiary Guarantors), the Issuer may request the release of a Subsidiary Guarantor which is no

<<<

 longer a Vessel Owner or Charterer by the delivery of a release request to the Bond Trustee. The Issuer hereby confirms that upon the Re-domiciliation becoming effective, the Existing Owner will no longer be a Vessel Owner or Charterer. Hence

<<<

, the Issuer may request the release of the Existing Owner as a Subsidiary Guarantor upon completion of the Re-domiciliation in relation to the relevant Vessel. However, following discussions with the Bond Trustee, the Issuer is undertaking

<<<

 to retain the Existing Owner with at least a minimum equity capital, until its solvent liquidation which shall not occur earlier than 12 months from the date of transfer of the Aoka Mizu. It is further agreed that the Existing
4

Owner shall

<<<

 be released as a Subsidiary Guarantor at the time of such liquidation. As a condition to such release, the Issuer shall provide a confirmation o f the due completion of the Re-domiciliation with respect to Aoka Mizu as well as such other documentary

<<<

 evidence thereof as the Bond Trustee may reasonably require.
To the extent Aoka Mizu is sold and transferred to another newly incorporated B.V. in the Netherlands (not being Bluewater (Aoka Mizu) B.V.), such newly incorporated B.V. will before

<<<

 the sale and transfer is concluded provide the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) with a guarantee on the same terms as Bluewater (Aoka Mizu) B.V. has previously provided, as well as such other documents necessary (if any) to provide

<<<

 for such New Owner to have the same rights and obligations under the Finance Documents as the Existing Owner, including such documentation and legal opinions in respect of such newly incorporated B.V. as the Bond Trustee reasonably requires

<<<

 (together, the "New O w ner Guarantee Documents").
On the basis that the Bond Trustee will receive the New Owner Guarantee Documents, the sale and transfer to a newly incporporated B.V. will not have a Material Adverse Effect and is thus permitted

<<<

 under the Bond Agreement, ref. clause 13.4.8. However, at the request o f Hurricane, the Bondholders are for the sake of good order asked to acknowledge and accept such a sale and transfer in the Proposed Resolution.
2.3.2 A new Senior Bank

<<<

 Facility Capital expenditure for Aoka Mizu will be funded by Hurricane on a cash neutral basis with payment to be made against milestones reflecting expenditure incurred by Bluewater and the development phases of the project. Hurricane will

<<<

 provide to Bluewater an acceptable financial instrument securing its obligations to make these payments.
Hurricane has, however, preliminarily requested that the New Owner and, if required, the EPC Contractor, enter into a cost overrun facility

<<<

 to the EPC Contractor and other facilities to the Group in an amount of up to USD 45 million (the "Overdraft Facility"). The Overdraft Facility will, to the extent required, be used to finance any cost overruns in relation to the upgrade work

<<<

 and to provide a performance bond in favour of Hurricane until first oil.
Under clause 13.4.3 (Financial Indebtedness restrictions) of the Bond Agreement, the New Owner and Bluewater Energy Services are permitted to hold financial indebtedness

<<<

 defined as "Senior Bank Facilities", which include any "future senior first priority bank facilities from commercial banks or export credit agencies obtained by a Subsidiary of the Issuer and secured by a Vessel other than "Glas Dowr" and 

<<<

"Haewene Brim" (in the present case, the Aoka Mizu), inter alia, to finance any upgrade, repair or lifetime extension related to any Vessel on the basis of new charter contracts (in the present case, the Agreements) with risk allocations not

<<<

 deviating substantially from industry terms for such charter contracts provided that the Vessel may only secure one Senior Bank Facility.
5

Based on the Issuer's assessment, the agreements with Hurricane have risk allocations not deviating

<<<

 substantially from industry terms for such charter contracts/projects. The Overdraft Facility will thus, in the Issuer's opinion, qualify as a Senior Bank Facility, which for the avoidance of doubt may also be utilised to issue performance

<<<

 bonds in favour of Hurricane also after first oil.
However, although the amount of a Senior Bank Facility has no financial limit under the Bond Agreement, the Issuer is accepting that a limit of USD 45 million be placed on the amount of the

<<<

 Overdraft Facility (and any refinancing thereof).
The New Owner will also be required to grant, amongst other things, a first priority mortgage over the Aolca Mizu to secure the Overdraft Facility. Although clause 13.4.1 (Negative pledge) of

<<<

 the Bond Agreement places certain restrictions on the Issuer and its Subsidiaries' ability to grant new security, such restrictions are not of relevance, as any security granted to secure a Senior Bank Facility is permitted.
W ith respect to

<<<

 the Intercreditor Deed, the Overdraft Facility will constitute a Future Senior Facility (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) and the Overdraft Facility lenders are expected to accede to and be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Deed

<<<

 as a Future Senior Finance Party (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed).
On the basis that the Overdraft Facility will constitute a Future Senior Facility, the obligations of the Existing Owner and the New Owner in respect of the Overdraft

<<<

 Facility and any guarantees provided by them in relation thereto will rank ahead o f the Bond Subsidiary Guarantees provided by the Existing Owner or the New Owner pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Deed. The Bond Subsidiary Guarantee

<<<

 issued by the EPC Contractor will rank pari passu with any guarantee issued by it in favour of the Overdraft Facility lenders. The Bond Subsidiary Guarantees issued by the Existing Owner or the New Owner and the EPC Contractor will rank pari

<<<

 passu with the obligations towards Hurricane, subject to the terms of the QEL.
The Aoka Mizu currently serves as collateral under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Issuer has agreed with certain of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility

<<<

 to extend the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility, with a reduced commitment, to 31 May 2017 with a view to implementing a longer term extension in due course. However, the Aoka Mizu will be released from the Revolving Credit Facility

<<<

 security as necessary for the Hurricane project.
2.3.3 Consent to the Mortgage, Hurricane Assignment and quiet enjoyment letterfrom the Bondholders (QEL)
Hurricane has requested Bluewater to obtain the QEL from the Bondholders pursuant to which

<<<

 the Bondholders, inter alia, shall (i) consent to the Mortgage and the Hurricane Assignment and (ii) provide certain undertakings not to bring claims against various Group Companies,
6

including the New Owner, and/or to interfere with Hurricane

<<<

's quiet enjoyment of the Aoka Mizu.
Summaries of the main terms of the Mortgage and the Hurricane Assignment are attached to the QEL as Annexes 1 and 2.
By this letter to the Bondholders and the Proposed Resolution, the Issuer thus requests

<<<

 that such QEL is resolved entered into by the Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders.
Hurricane has also requested that the lenders under the Project Financing Facility, and the Overdraft Facility when such lenders are determined, issue

<<<

 similar letters of quiet enjoyment in favour of Hurricane.
The Overdraft Facility lenders will, upon acceding to the Intrecreditor Deed, be bound by the terms of the existing Intercreditor Deed in addition to being bound by a quiet enjoyment

<<<

 agreement with Hurricane. In summary, pursuant to the Intercreditor Deed, the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders are in certain circumstances already subject to a standstill during a period of up to 180 days. This means that, in certain circumstances

<<<

, neither the Bond Trustee nor any of the Bondholders may bring any claim, including any enforcement action, malting a call or demand or accept any payment or file a bankruptcy petition, against the New Owner (or any of the other Obligors) or

<<<

 any of their assets (including the Aoka Mizu) during the term o f the standstill period unless explicitly permitted under the Intercreditor Deed, such as if any of the agents of the senior lenders have exercised rights of acceleration or taken

<<<

 any enforcement action (with exceptions) or made a call or demand against the above, or provided their consent to the respective enforcement action taken by the Bond Trustee.
2.3.4 Aurelia Guarantee The Heads o f Terms also require the Parent

<<<

 to issue a guarantee in favour of Hurricane securing the obligations of (i) the owner under the Bareboat Charter and (ii) the EPC Contractor under the EPC Contract, which will be in effect until the date when the Aoka Mizu passes the provisional

<<<

 acceptance test (the "A u relia Guarantee").
The Aurelia Guarantee will be granted by the Parent in relation to obligations incurred by the Existing Owner and the New Owner and the EPC Contractor in the ordinary course of business and is thus

<<<

 permitted under the Bond Agreement, ref. clauses 13.4.3 and 13.4.4. However, at the request of Hurricane, the Bondholders are for the sake of good order asked to acknowledge and accept the issue of the Aurelia Gurantee in the Proposed Resolutions

<<<

 (defined below).
2.3.5 Quiet Enjoyment Under the QEL, Hurricane has requested an agreement with the Bondholders not to bring claim against the New Owner and/or to interfere with Hurricane's quiet enjoyment o f the Aoka Mizu.
7

Moreover, the

<<<

 QEL will restrict the Bondholders from taking any step to wind up, liquidate, or place in administration or receivership the Existing Owner (during the period prior to transfer of title of the Aoka Mizu by the Existing Owner to the New Owner

<<<

), the New Owner, the EPC Contractor (during the period prior to final acceptance under the EPC Contract) or Bluewater Services (UK) Ltd, and at any time during the period prior to Final Acceptance the EPC Contractor. For the avoidance of doubt

<<<

, the QEL will not restrict the Bondholders from talcing any enforcement action or talcing any step to wind up, liquidate, or place in administration or receivership any other Group Companies (including in particular Bluewater Floating Production

<<<

 B.V., the Issuer or any of the Issuer's direct or indirect shareholders). The quiet enjoyment obligations of the Bondholders will be conditional on the EPC Contract or the Charter not having been lawfully terminated by the EPC Contractor or

<<<

 the owner under the Charter, respectively. The obligations will also fall away if the Aoka Mizu is a total loss and no longer available to its owner or if the title to the Aoka Mizu has been transferred in accordance with an enforcement under

<<<

 the Mortgage.

3.

AMENDMENTS

As consideration for, and subject to, the consent of the Bondholders to the Proposed Resolution, as well as the Agreements becoming, and continuing to be effective, certain amendments shall be implemented to the

 A - 7

Annex 1 - Summary of Security Assignment Greater Lancaster Area Development Aoka Mizu Early Production System
Note: thefollowing is a summary of the assignment provisions contained within the heads of terms. However, the exact terms

<<<

 of the security assignment to be entered into between the parties remains to be agreed. The terms are subject to commentfrom both Hurricane's and
Bluewater's insurance advisors.
1. Parties and Contractual Framework (A) Bluewater Energy Services

<<<

 B.V., a Dutch registered company and the contractor under the EPC Contract ("Contractor"). (B) Bluewater (Aoka Mizu) N.V., a Curasao registered company and an affiliate of the Contractor operating as a single purpose entity, the owner of the

<<<

 floating storage production and offloading facility (FPSO) Aoka Mizu (the "Owner"). (C) Hurricane GLA Limited (the "Company"), a company registered in England and a subsidiary of Hurricane Energy pic. The Company and its Co-Venturers are the

<<<

 owners of licence interests in the Greater Lancaster Area, and wish to process oil produced from the Greater Lancaster Area utilising an FPSO to be supplied by the Owner following completion of certain works (Upgrade Works) by Contractor pursuant

<<<

 to the EPC Contract. Contractor and Owner together are the Assignors under the Assignment Agreement, and Company is the Assignee.
By way of background:
1. the "Charter" refers to a bareboat charter to be entered into between the Owner and the

<<<

 Company in relation to the FPSO;
2. the "EPC Contract" refers to an engineering, procurement and construction contract in respect of the Upgrade Works to the FPSO to be entered into between the Contractor and the Company;
3. the "POSA Contract

<<<

" refers to a production services and operations agreement in respect of the operation of the FPSO at within the Greater Lancaster Area to be entered into between the POSA Contractor (an affiliate of the Contractor and the Owner) and the Company

<<<

;
4. the "Transaction Documents" means the Charter, the EPC Contract and the POSA Contract;
5. "First Oil" refers to the date on which the FPSO has satisfactorily completed the
Al-1

Production and Provisional Acceptance Test set out in the

<<<

 EPC Contract; and 6. "Step In Costs" refers to costs incurred by the Assignee in completing the Upgrade
Work due to termination of the EPC Contract.
2. Assignments The purpose of the Assignment Agreement(s) is to transfer the benefit of three

<<<

 groups of documents, together referred to as the "Assigned Property", to the Company as Assignee: 1. "CAR Insurance". This refers to the Construction All Risks insurance policy or policies relating to the FPSO and the Upgrade Works entered

<<<

 into by either of the Assignors in respect of the FPSO. This assignment can by agreement of the parties be replaced with a loss payable clause in order to achieve the same goals as mentioned in clause 3, in which case the words assignee, Assignor

<<<

, Assignment etc. in this agreement must be read as Loss payee, Loss payable clause, etc. 2. "Upgrade Contracts". This refers to all contracts entered into by the Assignors in connection with the performance of the Upgrade Works on the FPSO

<<<

. It is expected to include sub-contracts relating to: a. the design and delivery of the Mooring System and Buoy to be deployed at the drill site in the Greater Lancaster Area; b. the design and implementation of works to extend the operational

<<<

 life of the FPSO at the Greater Lancaster Area for ten (10) years from First Oil; c. the transportation of the FPSO to the Greater Lancaster Area; and d. commissioning and acceptance testing of the FPSO at the Lancaster Field. 3. "Owner's Requisition

<<<

 Compensation". This refers to compensation receivable by the Assignors in the event of the requisitioning of the FPSO by any government. Assignment of the Owner's Requisition Compensation is subject to commercial agreement between Bluewaterand

<<<

 Hurricane.
It should be noted that the lenders of the Overdraft Facility may require a first priority security assignment over the CAR Insurance and the hull & machinery insurance ("H&M Insurance") depending on the phase of the project (ie

<<<

 pre or post First Oil). Consequently, it is envisaged that a security trustee (appointed on behalf of lenders of the Facility Agreement and the Assignee) will hold the security over the insurances constituted by the Assignment(s) on behalf

<<<

 of both the lenders and the Assignee, with the proceeds of such insurances being allocated in a manner consistent with the principles set out in this Summary, taking account of the lenders' potential requirement of a first priority assignment

<<<

 as mentioned above.
Al-2

3. Purpose of the Assignment. The purpose of the Assignment Agreement is to enable the Assignee to take forward the Upgrade Works and deliver the FPSO to the Greater Lancaster Area in the event that the EPC Contract

<<<

 and/or the POSA are terminated or the Company exercises its right to Step In pursuant to the EPC Contract due to for example the insolvency of either or both of the Assignors or due to breach on the part of either Assignor (as defined in the

<<<

 EPC Contract and FPSO Charter).
Through the assignment of the Upgrade Contracts, the Assignee will have the ability to work with any subcontractors to complete the Upgrade Works. The assignment of the CAR Insurance and the Owner's Requisition

<<<

 Compensation (or as the Parties may agree, the entry instead into Loss Payable Clauses for the proceeds of the CAR Insurance to achieve the same goal), is to ensure that the proceeds of any claims under the CAR Insurance policy are passed to

<<<

 the Assignee, which then has an obligation to utilize the funds to complete the Upgrade Works and deliver the FPSO to the Greater Lancaster Area ready to operate.
Without the assignment, in the event of an Assignor's insolvency such that the

<<<

 Assignor being unable to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents (the Charter, the EPC Contract and the POSA Contract), the proceeds of any claim would normally be held by the administrators of the insolvent Assignor to meet

<<<

 the debts of the Assignor generally and would not be available to the Assignee to complete the FPSO project.
4. Warranties and Covenants Customary warranties and covenants in relation to a Security Assignment are to be included, the form of

<<<

 which remains to be agreed.
5. Secured Obligations of the Assignors The obligations secured by the Assignment are: a. prior to First Oil, the Contractor's obligations (whether actual or contingent) to the Assignee under the EPC Contract following

<<<

 termination of the EPC Contract, including the obligation to pay any Step In Costs; and
Al-3

b. post First Oil, (i) the Contractor's obligations (whether actual or contingent) under the EPC Contract following termination of the EPC Contract

<<<

 and (ii) the POSA Contractor's obligations under POSA Contract following termination of the POSA Contract, in each case where the termination of the EPC Contract and/or the POSA Contract has resulted from breach by the BES parties.
6. Application

<<<

 of Monies The Assignee will be entitled to retain any monies received under the CAR Insurance or the H&M Insurance where the FPSO is an actual or constructive total loss, to the extent of the amounts paid by the Assignee under the EPC Contract

<<<

, including all costs of obtaining financing for such payment and interest. In such event, the proceeds of the CAR Insurance or the H&M Insurance will be paid to the Assignee as a function of the Loss Payable Clause in respect of the CAR Insurance

<<<

 policy or the H&M Insurance policy (as the case may be). Other than following a constructive or actual total loss: (i) prior to First Oil and following termination of the EPC Contract or the exercise by the Company of its rights to Step In

<<<

, as a result of the insolvency of an Assignor or breach of an Assignor, any monies received by the Assignee pursuant to the Assignment are to be applied to performance of the Upgrade Work and/or in satisfaction of any Step In Costs incurred

<<<

 by the Assignee; and (ii) although the precise terms upon which insurance proceeds are to be applied after First Oil are to be agreed, in principle it is expected that following termination of the POSA Contract as a result of the insolvency

<<<

 of an Assignor or breach by an Assignor, any sums received by the Assignee pursuant to the Assignment are to be applied to meet (i) any outstanding obligation of an Assignor under the EPC Contract arising due to termination of the EPC Contract

<<<

 and (ii) any liabilities of an Assignor (including the repair of any damage to the FPSO) arising due to the termination of the POSA Contract.
This is in line with the overall purpose of the assignment, to allow the Company, as Assignee to deliver

<<<

 the Greater Lancaster Area project in the event of the insolvency of one or more of the Assignors (or termination of any of the Transaction Documents for other reasons, as outlined in 3 above).
Al-4

Any monies received under CAR Insurance

<<<

 and the H&M Insurance prior to termination of the EPC Contract and/or POSA Contract (other than where the FPSO is an actual or constructive total loss), shall be applied in accordance with the Loss Payable Clauses (which remain to be agreed

<<<

) but in principle will provide that (i) the proceeds of the CAR Insurance and H&M Insurance are to be paid to either the Contractor or the POSA Contractor for application in accordance with the terms of the EPC Contract or the POSA Contract

<<<

 as the case may be (or in circumstances where the Assignee is liable/responsible for repairs, to the Assignee) and (ii) the proceeds of the protection and indemnity insurances are to paid to the party discharging its liability to the claimant

<<<

 third party.
7. Continuing Security The security created by the Assignment in relation to the Assignee's interest in the construction all risks insurance and the Upgrade Contracts is to remain in effect until the final discharge of (i) any

<<<

 Step In Costs and (ii) the Assignors' obligations under the EPC Contract.
The security created by the Assignment in relation to the Assignee's interest in the Assigned Property other than the construction all risks insurance and the Upgrade

<<<

 Contracts is to remain in effect until the final discharge of the liabilities of the Assignors under the POSA Contract or the Charter (which remains to be agreed).
The Security exists in addition to any other security held by the Assignee in

<<<

 respect of the performance of the EPC Contract and/or the Charter.
The Assignors' liabilities under the Assignment are unaffected by any act or omission of the Assignee which might otherwise operate to discharge or otherwise affect any of the

<<<

 obligations of any of the Assignors under this Assignment.
8. Powers Of The Assignee On An Event Of Default The Assignee be entitled to exercise its rights as assignee of the Assigned Property only upon termination of the EPC Contract, FPSO

<<<

 Charter and/or the POSA Contract as a result of the insolvency of an Assignor or breach by an Assignor as set out in the EPC Contract and/or POSA.
Al-5

9. Power of Attorney Each of the Assignors appoints the Assignee as its attorney-in-fact

<<<

. The appointment is irrevocable, but expires at the end of the Charter Period. The Assignee may not exercise its powers as an attorney-in-fact unless either the EPC Contract or the POSA Contract (or both) have been terminated.
10. Redemption

<<<

 After the discharge of the relevant obligations and liabilities referred to in 5 above, the Assignee is to re-assign the right, interest and title in the relevant part of the Assigned Property as exists at that time to the Assignors.
11. Waivers

<<<

, Remedies Cumulative The Assignee's rights under the Assignment shall not be waived by any delay or failure by the Assignee to exercise any right or remedy available to it under the Assignment. The Assignee's rights under the Assignment are

<<<

 in addition to any rights or remedies to which the Assignee is entitled under English law.
12. Successors and Assigns The Assignors may not assign or transfer any of their rights or obligations under this Assignment. The Assignee may assign

<<<

 its rights under this Assignment to any person to whom the Assignee's rights, or rights and obligations, under the Transaction Documents are assigned or transferred.
13. Governing Law The Assignment shall be governed by and construed in accordance

<<<

 with English law and any dispute shall be resolved in the English courts.

(i) Failure to Transfer the FPSO: The Company terminates the Relevant Documents by reason of a failure

<<<

 on the part of the Existing Owner to transfer the FPSO to the New Owner and is therefore entitled to a refund of all payments made by Company pursuant to the EPC Contract and/or Project Master Agreement as at the date of termination and the

<<<

 relevant BES Party has not refunded these payments within a period of 45 days after termination.
(ii) Minimum Liquidity Enforcement: Prior to the completion date of the Upgrade Work, the Company has exercised its right to terminate the EPC

 of its intention to complete the Upgrade Work;

 payment obligations (such default not having been remedied) under any of the Relevant Documents; and
(2) such default is likely, in the reasonable opinion of Bluewater to have caused Liquidity to be below the Bond Liquidity Covenant Amount

<<<

, when tested1.

<<<

 period or, if longer,
1Compliance/testing with liquidity to be agreed between Bluewater and Hurricane.
A2-4

any other grace period granted by the relevant creditor, and such payment default has not been remedied or waived by the relevant

<<<

 creditor and the Liquidity of Bluewater Holding B. V. and its subsidiaries tested at the time of the payment default is below the Bond Liquidity Covenant Amount (a "Relevant Payment Default"); provided, however, that no enforcement will be

<<<

 triggered under this paragraph (iii) if:
(1) the Company is in default of any of its due and payable payment obligations (such default not having been remedied) under any of the Relevant Documents; and
(2) such default is likely, in the reasonable

<<<

 opinion of Bluewater to have caused Liquidity to be below the Bond Liquidity Covenant Amount, when tested,
and furthermore any enforcement under this section 8 (iii) shall be subject to the provisions of section 9 (d) below.
(iv) Enforcement

<<<

 action: The PFF lenders, the Overrun Lenders or the Bondholders take any formal steps to enforce any security against any of the BES Parties (being, the Existing Owner, the New Owner, the POSA Contractor and BES (but with respect to BES, only

 in the period prior to final acceptance under the EPC Contract)), Bluewater Floating Production B.V. or Bluewater Services (UK) Ltd held pursuant to the PFF Facility, the Overrun Facility or the Bond Agreement (as the case may be) by reason

<<<

 of default on the part of any member of the Bluewater Group and such enforcement action is not discontinued, stayed, discharged or withdrawn within 30 days of commencement.
(v) Breach of QEL: The PFF lenders or the Bondholders take any enforcement

<<<

 action that constitutes a breach of the terms of the quiet enjoyment letters entered into by the Bond Trustee or the PFF lenders, respectively.
(vi) Insolvency: The issue of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against a BES Party(but with

<<<

 respect to BES, only in the period until Final Acceptance), Bluewater Services (UK) Ltd. or Bluewater Floating Productions B.V. in any jurisdiction whatsoever unless such proceedings are discontinued, stayed, discharged or withdrawn within

<<<

 30 days of commencement, provided that no enforcement right shall be triggered under this paragraph (vi) if the Company is in default of its due and payable payment obligations (such default not having been remedied) under any of the Relevant

<<<

 Documents and such default is, in the reasonable opinion of Bluewater, reasonably likely to have caused the relevant insolvency event.
9. Notice Periods and Consultation
(a) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in section 8, the

<<<

 Company and/or Bluewater shall promptly notify the Bond Trustee, with such written notice to specify the details of the default and the claim on which basis the Company is taking the enforcement action.
