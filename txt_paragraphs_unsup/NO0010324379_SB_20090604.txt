1. BACKGROUND

 ASA
The Company has during these discussions, on a confidential basis, supplied the Bondholders Committee with information on its financial situation that to a large degree confirms the liquidity situation described in the summons to the previous

<<<

 bondholders meeting, dated 28 January 2008 (the "Previous Summons"). As described in the Previous Summons, it has been necessary to provide additional liquidity support, and DnB NOR Bank ASA (the "Bank") has under certain conditions accepted

<<<

 to increase the Company's working capital facility. This facility was described in more detail in the Previous Summons. The Bank has, as one of its conditions, assumed that the maturity of the Loan is extended, and that an agreement between

<<<

 the bondholders and the Company regarding such an extension, is entered into. As stated in the Previous Summons the Bank has shown a flexible attitude regarding the length of the extension period, and regards a two year extension, i.e. until

<<<

 28 June 2012, to be acceptable.
2. AMENDMENTS TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT
Based on the above mentioned elements the Company and the Loan Trustee have entered into an agreement (the "Agreement"). The implications and consequences of the Agreement

<<<

 for the Loan are in this summons to a Bondholders Meeting put forward to the Bondholders as a proposal (the "Proposal") for decision. The members of the Bondholders Committee have undertaken to vote in favour of the Proposal. Based on this

<<<

 undertaking from the members of the Bondholders Committee the Bank has already released to the Company the increase in the working capital facility referred to above.
The Proposal includes amendments to the Loan Agreement and attached conditions

<<<

, described in brief as follows (for more detail, see the proposed resolution):
- The maturity of the Loan is extended to 28 June 2012 and will mature at a price of 120 % of par.

· prior to 29 June 2010 - 100 %

 of par · from and including 29 June 2010 to 29 June 2011 - 110 % of par · from and including 29 June 2011 - 120 % of par.
- The Borrower may incur new financial indebtedness (as pr. 1 January 2009) amounting to NOK 120 million by way of increased

<<<

 working capital facility including a NOK 15 million increase in factoring financing.

<<<

 shall trigger a proportionate redemption of the Loan (at a price corresponding with the call option, see above).

· NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
- A cash sweep provision is inserted whereby 50 % Free Cash annually, less redemption in accordance

<<<

 with the previous paragraph, shall be applied for proportionate redemption of the Loan and the working capital facility to the Bank with 80 % of the Free Cash available to the Loan and 20 % to the Bank.
- The Borrower shall not during the lifetime

<<<

 of the Loan make any dividend payments or other contributions to its owner.

<<<

 is not finalized within the time limit, the present owner of the Company will transfer 75 % of the shares in the Company to the Bondholders against a payment of NOK 0.10 pr. share (number of shares to be transferred: 3 780).
- In case the Bank

<<<

 Cancellation (see above) materializes, and is not compensated by an equity injection or by a subordinated loan, the present owner of the Company will transfer 25 % of the shares in the Company to the Bondholders against a payment of NOK 0.

<<<

10 pr. share (number of shares to be transferred: 1 260).
- The Bondholders may during the lifetime of the loan appoint two board members or observers to the board of the Company. If such new board members are appointed, the Company decides

<<<

 whether the total number of board members shall expand or if present board members shall be replaced.
- The Company has undertaken to pay for the legal costs and other expenses incurred in connection with the restructuring of the Loan, and

<<<

 to engage an independent financial advisor.
As a consequence of the owners undertaking, under certain conditions, to transfer shares to the Bondholders, the Put Option upon a Change of Control Event (clause 10.3 of the Loan agreement) is abandoned

<<<

.
3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders should independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
The

<<<

 Bondholders should however note that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Borrower will in the short run still not be in strong financial position and will have considerably challenges going forward.
It is recommended that the Bondholders

<<<

 consult with tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences of the Proposal.
