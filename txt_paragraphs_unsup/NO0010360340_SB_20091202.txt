10 million FRN Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012. ISIN NO 001 036034.0

Oslo, 2 December 2009

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING
1. INTRODUCTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed

<<<

 as loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001 036034.0 (the "Loan") issued by Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited ("Remedial").
All capitalised terms used herein

<<<

 shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement governing the Bonds dated 23 March, 2007 between Remedial and the Loan Trustee (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated in this summons.

The information in this summons regarding

<<<

 the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information.
2. BACKGROUND
On 27 July 2009, Remedial announced that it expected to initiate

<<<

 a restructuring of its current financial position or would require the injection of additional capital before the end of 2009. Remedial further announced on 18 September 2009 that its free cash position would be at a critically low level by

<<<

 the end of September 2009. At the end of November 2009, the cash position of Remedial was $0.3 million in free cash and $56.5 million of blocked funds in the Escrow Account for the Bonds. Accordingly, absent agreement with the Bondholders,

<<<

 Remedial is facing a severe funding shortfall which requires to be resolved if Remedial is to secure the delivery of the ESV1 and ESV2 vessels and continue its immediate operations.
The blocking of the Escrow Account arises since there is a

<<<

 continuing Event of Default in existence under the terms of the Loan Agreement, as a consequence of Remedial's failure to make the interest payment on the Bonds due on 28 September 2009.
On 18 September 2009, Remedial had requested the Loan

<<<

 Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to seek amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement, including the deferral of interest. On 1 October 2009, upon a request from the Loan Trustee, Remedial agreed to defer the call for a Bondholders

<<<

' meeting to permit Bondholders to consider and respond to Remedial's proposed amendments to the terms of the Loan Agreement. In order to assist with the consideration of such proposals, the Loan Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders, engaged

<<<

 independent advisors, AMA Capital Partners LLC ("AMA") and Bingham McCutchen

www.triivStce.no
(London) LLP ("Bingham") (together the "Advisors") to perform due diligence on Remedial and give advice on the Bondholders' position and the proposed amendments to the

<<<

 terms of the Loan Agreement. The engagement is supported by more than 50 % of the Bondholders. The Advisors have been in direct contact with an ad hoc committee of Bondholders holding approximately 60% of the outstanding Bonds (the "Committee

<<<

").
Since that time Bingham and AMA have undertaken due diligence on Remedial, and have held numerous discussions and meetings with Remedial's management and advisers.
The Advisors, in consultation with the Committee, have put forth a proposal

<<<

 for the restructuring of Remedial in the form of a term sheet (the "Term Sheet"). The Advisors have indicated that the Committee in principle is supportive of a restructuring in the form of that proposal, and that this is likely to present

<<<

 the only remaining opportunity for a consensual restructuring of Remedial's balance sheet that would avoid the alternative of insolvency proceedings. The Advisors have suggested that Remedial is left with little option in the circumstances

<<<

 but to propose a restructuring in the form of the Term Sheet to both Remedial's shareholders and the Bondholders.
Remedial has summoned an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to be held on 14 December 2009 (the "EGM"), in order

<<<

 to approve various resolutions (the "EGM Resolutions"), and in particular those required to implement the Term Sheet. Remedial will, within the next couple of days, request the Loan Trustee to summon a bondholders meeting for the approval of

<<<

 the restructuring proposal set forth by the Advisors in the Term Sheet (the "Restructuring Proposal"). The Term Sheet will be appended to that meeting summons.
Due to its critical cash position, Remedial has however approached the Loan Trustee

<<<

 to convene a Bondholders' meeting before this, to consider permitting a partial release of up to $3.0 million of the funds currently held in the Escrow Account up to and including 13 January 2010 to allow Remedial to meet on-going financial

<<<

 obligations up to the time of the EGM and (a) if the necessary EGM proposals and the Restructuring Proposal are approved, for a short period thereafter to allow closing of the Restructuring Proposal, or (b) in the event that the necessary EGM

<<<

 proposals and/or the Restructuring Proposal are not approved, to allow Remedial to make arrangements with the Advisors for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders.
Please refer to Remedial

<<<

's third quarter release of 2009 attached as Appendix B to this summons which is intended to give an update of Remedial's financial and operational status. Bondholders are encouraged to read the attached document.
3. THE ESCROW PROPOSAL
Due

<<<

 its critical cash position, Remedial has approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders meeting to consider permitting a partial release of up to $3.0 million of the funds currently held in the Escrow Account up to and including 13 January

<<<

 2010 to allow Remedial to meet on-going financial obligations up to the time of the EGM and (a) if the necessary EGM proposals and the Restructuring Proposal are approved, for a short period thereafter to allow closing of the Restructuring

<<<

 Proposal, or (b) in the event that the necessary EGM proposals and/or the Restructuring Proposal are not approved, to allow Remedial to make arrangements with the Advisors for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs in a manner that maximises

<<<

 recoveries for Bondholders. The costs to be covered by the proposed partial release of up to $3.0 million of the funds currently held in the Escrow Account are mainly costs of operations, general and administrative costs, vessel capital expenditure

<<<

 costs,

payments to legal and financial advisers to Remedial and the Loan Trustee and other operational running obligations.
The proposal to release to Remedial some of the funds currently held in

<<<

 the Escrow Account is set out further in this section (the "Proposal").
3.1 Release offundsfrom the Escrow Account
The Escrow Account is currently held by The Winterbotham Trust Company Limited in its capacity as escrow agent under the terms

<<<

 of an escrow agreement dated 23 March 2007 between Remedial, the Loan Trustee and The Winterbotham Trust Company Limited. The monies in the Escrow Account are also subject to a first ranking Bahamian law pledge in favour of the Loan Trustee

<<<

 as security for the Loan which may currently be enforced following the occurrence of the Event of Default occasioned by non-payment of accrued interest on the Loan. It is proposed that all monies held in the Escrow Account (together with all

<<<

 interest accrued thereon) shall be moved to a US dollar trust account held by and in the name of the Loan Trustee (the "Loan Trustee Account"). Remedial and the Loan Trustee shall, within two Banking Days of the passing of the resolutions set

<<<

 out in this summons, jointly in writing instruct The Winterbotham Trust Company Limited in its capacity as escrow agent in relation to the Escrow Account to effect this transfer immediately.
Remedial will be entitled to submit to the Loan Trustee

<<<

 one or more requests for the release of monies held in the Loan Trustee Account on or before 13 January 2010 (a "Release Request") which shall be accompanied by a cashflow forecast for the following four weeks. The Loan Trustee, in consultation

<<<

 with AMA, shall promptly consider such Release Request (taking into account the latest cashflow forecasts provided by Remedial and discussions with management of Remedial). Remedial will promptly respond to any queries raised by the Loan Trustee

<<<

 or AMA in relation to any such Release Request. The Loan Trustee will not be obliged to release any monies from the Loan Trustee Account, and will only be authorised to release monies from the Loan Trustee Account with the approval of AMA.

<<<

 The maximum aggregate amount which may be released from the Loan Trustee Account without further approval from the Bondholders is $3.0 million.
Unless the Loan Trustee agrees otherwise (based on advice from Bingham that it is not possible to

<<<

 take all or part of such security), all amounts advanced to Remedial under the terms of the Loan Agreement, including any funds released to Remedial from the Loan Trustee Account, shall be secured over:
(a) three GE Model 7FDM16 diesel engines

<<<

 with generator and one GE Model 7FDM8 with generator which were constructed by LeTourneau Technologies Power Systems pursuant to a purchase order dated 6 August 2007 with Remedial Offshore Limited and which are currently being stored by Advance

<<<

 Rig Services LLC at their yard in Houston, Texas; and
(b) (b) 216 feet of 6" gear rack, 2,543 feet of 5" gear rack, and 1,728 feet of half chord for 6" and 5" gear rack, which were acquired from and stored at Global Fabrication Services, Inc

<<<

.,
(together, the "Additional Loan Security").

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
ww w .m isree.no
3.2 Conditions The Bondholders' acceptance of the Proposal is conditional on the following: (a) all monies in the Escrow Account being moved to the Loan

<<<

 Trustee Account; and (b) unless otherwise agreed by the Loan Trustee (based on advice from Bingham that it is not
possible to take all or part of such security), the Additional Loan Security being granted in a form acceptable to the Loan Trustee

<<<

 (in consultation with Bingham). 3.3 Remedial's evaluation of the Proposal The Proposal would assist in enabling Remedial to make upcoming payments and meet continuing operating obligations up to the time of the EGM and (a) if the necessary

<<<

 EGM proposals and the Restructuring Proposal are approved, for a short period thereafter to allow closing of the Restructuring Proposal, or (b) in the event that the necessary EGM proposals and/or the Restructuring Proposal are not approved

<<<

, to allow Remedial to make arrangements with the Advisors for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders. If the necessary EGM proposals and the Restructuring Proposal are approved, Remedial

<<<

 would be in a fully financed position for approximately the next twelve months. It is important for the continuation of the operations of Remedial, pending approval and completion of the Restructuring Proposal, to be able to cover the costs

<<<

 of operations, general and administrative costs and other operational continuing obligations. It is Remedial's intention, in the event that the necessary EGM proposals and/or the Restructuring Proposal are not approved, to make arrangements

<<<

 with the Advisors for an organised wind-down of Remedial's affairs in a manner that maximises recoveries for Bondholders.

4. PROPOSAL FOR EXPENSES OF THE LOAN TRUSTEE
4.1 AMA
At the request of an ad hoc

<<<

 committee of Bondholders, the Loan Trustee initially approached AMA to represent the interests of the Bondholders with respect to a potential restructuring of the Bonds, and AMA has been working on this matter since August 2009 and was engaged

<<<

 through an engagement letter.
Remedial is supportive of the appointment of AMA as financial adviser to the Loan Trustee based on the information that the appointment was supported by more than 50 % of the Bondholders. Remedial has agreed to

<<<

 pay the monthly retainer and the success fee which would become due on completion of a Transaction (as defined below) to AMA (such fees being further detailed below). However, Remedial has not yet paid any such monthly retainer payable to AMA

<<<

 on account of its current cash position.
In the event that the Proposal is approved, monies released from the Loan Trustee Account will enable Remedial to meet the monthly retainer fees and expenses of AMA. Furthermore, in the event that the

<<<

 Restructuring Proposal is subsequently approved, the monies in the Loan Trustee Account will be released to Remedial and Remedial will have sufficient liquidity to pay success fee amounts due to AMA.
However, in circumstances where the Restructuring

<<<

 Proposal is not so approved, Remedial will be unable to make payments due to AMA. It is accordingly proposed that the fees and expenses of AMA be met out of the Bondholders' cash recoveries, to the extent that the Restructuring Proposal does

<<<

 not obtain the requisite shareholder and Bondholder approval. AMA's engagement letter provides for payment of AMA's fees out of the Bondholders' cash recoveries subject to approval at a Bondholder meeting. Approval is therefore being sought

<<<

 from Bondholders that NTM be authorised to meet AMA's fees out of Bondholders' cash recoveries on the following basis.
Scope o f Work
AMA are providing financial advisory services to the Loan Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders). These services

<<<

 include conducting a business due diligence in relation to Remedial, and advising the Loan Trustee and assisting Bondholders in negotiations and discussions with Remedial and other stakeholders and commercial counterparties.
Monthly Retainer

<<<


AMA will be entitled to a monthly retainer of USD 60,000 per month for the term of the engagement, which will be for a minimum of two months, from the signing of the engagement letter.

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA www. trustct',no

Transaction

<<<

 Fees
If the Bond is restructured or redeemed in a manner which creates, or the Bondholders otherwise receive with respect to the Bond, a definitive recovery where the Recovered Amount (as defined below) is in excess of zero, then AMA will be

<<<

 entitled to receive a "Restructuring Fee" in accordance with the following table:

Recovered Amount (R)
0 - 40% 40% < R < 60% 60% < R <100%

Percentage Fee applicable to relevant proportion of
Recovered Amount
0.00%
1.50%
1.25%

"Recovered

<<<

 Amount" will mean the total amount of cash and the fair market value of the non cash consideration paid on the date of the closing of any transaction(s), including all securities and other property paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by

<<<

 an acquiring party, and shall also include any liabilities indirectly or directly assumed or acquired or otherwise repaid by the acquiring party in connection with or anticipation of the sale. In the event that any portion of the Recovered

<<<

 Amount is not delivered at closing, is subject to adjustment or is placed in escrow, the fee with respect to such portion of the Recovered Amount shall be paid to AMA if and when such consideration is received by the Bondholders.
AMA will also

<<<

 be entitled to reimbursement of its out of pocket expenses reasonably incurred in connection with providing its services.
It is proposed that the monthly retainer fees and out of pocket expenses of AMA be paid as a joint first priority out

<<<

 of amounts it receives for distribution to Bondholders (pro rata to the costs and expenses of the Loan Trustee) and before payment of any success fees payable to AMA and the distribution of those cash recoveries to the Bondholders It is further

<<<

 proposed that any success fee payable to AMA be paid as a second priority out of amounts it receives for distribution to Bondholders before the distribution of those cash recoveries to the Bondholders. This means that the AMA fees will effectively

<<<

 be shared amongst all of the Bondholders.
AMA's engagement may be terminated on 5 days' notice by either party. The Restructuring Fee shall be payable in respect of a transaction consummated within 12 months of the termination date.
The Loan

<<<

 Trustee will also indemnity AMA in respect of all losses and liabilities it may incur as a result of the engagement. This indemnity will be capped at US$3 million and shall only be payable out of and to the extent of proceeds being received

<<<

 with respect to the relevant Bond issue. The indemnity will terminate 12 months after the date of the engagement letter, save in respect of accrued liabilities which have been notified in writing prior to that date by AMA.
4.2 Other expenses

<<<


The Loan Trustee is incurring fees, costs and expenses in its capacity as Loan Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders as a result of the restructuring discussions between Remedial and Bondholders. This includes legal expenses involved in the

<<<

 retention of Bingham by the Loan

6

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA www.nustee.no

Trustee. However, as outlined above, Remedial has been unable to continue to meet these fees and expenses as a result of its lack of liquidity. As a consequence certain

<<<

 individual Bondholders have agreed to fund the fees of Bingham in the event that Remedial fails to make payment (the "Funding Bondholders").

As outlined above, in the event that the Proposal is approved, the monies released from the Loan Trustee

<<<

 Account will enable Remedial to meet the fees and expenses of the Loan Trustee (including legal expenses). Furthermore, in the event that the Restructuring Proposal is subsequently approved, the monies in the Loan Trustee Account will be released

<<<

 to Remedial and Remedial will have sufficient liquidity to settle the Loan Trustee's fees, costs and expenses (including legal expenses). However, if the Restructuring Proposal is not approved, Remedial will be unable to make such payments

<<<

, and accordingly the Loan Trustee is seeking approval of payment of such amounts out of the Bondholders' cash recoveries in such circumstances.

It is therefore proposed that the Bondholders' meetings ratify and authorise the payment of the

<<<

 Loan Trustee's fees, costs and expenses (including legal expenses) incurred in it acting as trustee (on behalf of Bondholders) out of cash recoveries received by the Loan Trustee in respect of the Bonds, as a joint first priority out of amounts

<<<

 it receives for distribution to Bondholders (pro rata to the monthly retainer fees and out of pocket expenses payable to AMA), and before payment of any success fees payable to AMA and the distribution of cash recoveries to the Bondholders

<<<

. This will include the Loan Trustee reimbursing Funding Bondholders who have met any fees, costs and expenses of Bingham in the first instance on the same joint first priority basis. The effect of this will be that these fees, costs and expenses

<<<

 of Bingham will be born by all Bondholders and not just the Funding Bondholders.

Remedial Releases 3rd Quarter 2009 Results - Discusses partial conversion of bond debt to equity with bondholder advisors
10 November 2009 - The Board of Directors

<<<

 of Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited (`the Company') today approved the unaudited consolidated accounts for the 9 months ended 30 September 2009. See the "Financial Information" section in this release for details.
Revenues and Expenditures

<<<

 During the quarter, the Company received a payment in respect of a reimbursement of certain initial mobilization costs previously incurred and expensed with respect to the potential Chevron Thailand contract. The Company also recorded the sale

<<<

 of the large crane and mud pump, included in Owner Furnished Equipment held for sale, as revenue and the associated expenses as cost of sales. The crane was sold at carrying value (original cost less an allowance for sales commission), whereas

<<<

 the mud pump had to be sold at a discount to original cost. Certain other minor OFE held for sale items were written down to expected recovery value. The Company also incurred expenses for offshore personnel and administrative support. The

<<<

 third quarter result includes a $1.9 million debit relating to the change in the mark-to-market valuation of interest rate swaps.
Financing At 30 September 2009, the Company held $56.5 million of funds in escrow to cover future expenditure

<<<

 commitments for constructing and financing the first two vessels and $1.1 million of free cash to cover future operating costs and additional commitments in respect to the first two vessels.
At the end of October 2009, the cash position of

<<<

 the Company was $0.75 million in free cash and $56.5 million in escrow. The Company will require the free cash on hand and anticipated receipts from the sale of OFE concluded in the third quarter to be able to continue its operations through

<<<

 November 2009. The Company expects that the $2.3 million due will be received in part during November with the balance due in December 2009. Thereafter, the Company will require further proceeds from new OFE sales, the release of some of the

<<<

 escrow funds, or new equity or loans to support its immediate operations.
1

The Company's operating expenses are around $1 million a month, which will increase to around $2 million a month upon delivery of Remedial ESV Guardian. Without the

<<<

 benefit of customer contracts the Company estimates a forecast cash spend of approximately $70 million (excluding loan interest payments and deferred shipyard payments) to the end of October 2010 based upon forecast remaining gross capital

<<<

 expenditures of $43 million, overheads of $6m, vessel warm stack expenditures of $14 million and an allowance for mobilisation costs of $7 million. Depending on the timing and location of future contract awards the funding requirement may increase

<<<

 or decrease.
Due to the limited free cash available coupled with the current lack of firm contracts, latest vessel delivery schedules and potential requirements for mobilisation costs, the Company is working with its shareholders and bondholders

<<<

 on options to restructure its financing position and use the $56.5 million funds held in escrow for the most appropriate benefit to the Company. Agreement has been reached with each of COSCO and Yantai shipyards (in principle) that the Company

<<<

 may defer $7 million of the delivery payment in respect to each of Remedial ESV Solution and Remedial ESV Guardian for 12 months from delivery provided an acceptable security is provided to each shipyard. These deferred payments will fall due

<<<

 after the end of October 2010.
On 18th September 2009, the Company requested Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, as loan trustee, to summon a bondholders' meeting at which the bondholders would be requested to agree to a deferral of interest on the loan

<<<

 for a period of at least twelve months (to be capitalised to the principal amount of the loan at maturity date), the release of part of the funds in the escrow account for use for general corporate purposes and, in return, the Company would

<<<

 pay an additional amount to bondholders by way of a premium equal to 5% of the loan principal at maturity date.
On 1st October, upon request from the loan trustee, the Company agreed to defer the call for a bondholders' meeting to permit bondholders

<<<

 to consider and respond to the Company's proposed amendments to the Loan terms. On behalf of the bondholders, the loan trustee engaged a financial advisor (AMA Capital Partners LLC) and a legal adviser (Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP) to perform

<<<

 due diligence of the Company and give advice on the bondholders' position and the proposed amendments. On 30th September 2009, the Company was informed by the loan trustee that bondholders holding 52% of the loan support retention of these

<<<

 advisers.
The Company was advised by the representatives of the bondholders that the Company's initial proposal would not obtain the acceptance of the bondholders and the Company has ongoing discussions with the representatives in order to

<<<

 agree on a proposal to the bondholders meeting that is likely to be accepted.
2

An amended proposal has been received from the representatives of the bondholders which would result in a conversion of all indebtedness under the loan other

<<<

 than $56.5 million to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares representing 96 % of the post-restructuring share capital of the Company to the bondholders, a deferral of interest payments, and a release of the escrow monies for shipyard

<<<

 payments (as adjusted for the deferred payments) and general corporate purposes. In addition the proposal allows for an additional debt facility of $13.5 million to be secured against the vessels ranking on an equal basis to the remaining bond

<<<

 loan.
The Company has suggested certain amendments to the proposal from the representatives implying that the indebtedness under the loan other than $56.5 million shall be converted to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares to the

<<<

 bondholders representing 94% of the post-restructuring share capital based on an agreed equity value for this 94% of $55,575 million. The Company has further proposed to carry out a rights issue of shares for the aggregate gross subscription

<<<

 price of $20 million at a pre-money equity valuation of $58.5 million (after allowing for the $56.5 million bond loan, the additional $13.5 million of new debt and the $14 million of deferred shipyard payments) for 100% of the equity, for which

<<<

 the current shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe. Following such a rights issue, the bondholders would own approximately 70% of the enlarged share capital and 100% of the residual bond loan.
Either of proposals detailed above would place

<<<

 the Company in a fully financed position for approximately the next twelve months. As of today there is no agreement on either proposal.
The Company has not made the interest payment due 28 September 2009 of $3.1 million, as deferral of the

<<<

 interest payment is one of the proposals for amendment of the loan. The Company is therefore in technical default of the loan.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As explained in the liquidity position note

<<<

, the Group requires additional funds in order to complete delivery of its vessels and allow time for contracts for the vessels to be obtained and generate cash flow. As the refinancing proposals would place the Group in a fully financed position

<<<

 for approximately the next twelve months, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In the event that a refinancing is not successful the Group would be forced to sell assets in a distressed situation and the possible

<<<

 impacts of such sales on the Balance Sheet carrying value are discussed in the Potential Asset Impairment Note.
Market Update Most of the long term business opportunities being pursued by the Company have been deferred into 2010, although during

<<<

 the third quarter the Company did submit a tender for a four-year workover and well intervention contract which is due to commence in Q3 2010. The potential client has not yet
3

announced a decision regarding the tender. The Company has also

<<<

 provided indicative pricing to potential prospects in the windmill and accommodation markets during the third quarter.
During 2008, Remedial Offshore Limited (Remedial) was awarded a contract by Chevron Offshore (Thailand) Limited (Chevron

<<<

) to provide one of its ESVTM units for operations in the Gulf of Thailand. During Q1 2009 an Amendment to the Contract was signed which gives Chevron the right to designate the Contract commencement date by giving Remedial 90 days' advance

<<<

 written notice. As of the date of this report, no commencement date has been nominated by Chevron. If Chevron does not designate the commencement date on or before 1 March 2010 the Contract will automatically terminate without penalty.
Vessel

<<<

 Construction Update Latest photos of the ESV construction status can be seen at www.remedialoffshore.com.
COSCO: The Remedial ESV Solution under construction at COSCO Shipyards is nearing completion. During the 3rd quarter, the balance of the

<<<

 vessel's 425-foot legs was installed and fit-out of the accommodation block was completed. The shipyard are finishing a number of commissioning tasks as they prepare to complete electrical load tests, thruster installation and jacking trials

<<<

. The shipyard will then proceed with the sea trials before delivery. The Company anticipates Solution will be delivered before the end of the fourth quarter of 2009.
Yantai: The Remedial ESV Guardian under construction at Yantai Raffles Shipyard

<<<

 (YRS) was approximately 80% complete at 30 September 2009. During the third quarter the shipyard continued to work on installation of the large crane, piping and cabling systems and build-out of the accommodation block. During the fourth quarter

<<<

 the shipyard has installed the vessel's legs. The latest schedule from YRS forecasts Guardian to be delivered during the first quarter of 2010 but based upon current progress, delivery could be delayed further.
Work-Over Rigs: Construction

<<<

 of the two lift-off work over rigs is progressing and during the quarter the first rig was ready for testing of the top drive.
Owner-Furnished Equipment (OFE) held for sale: The Company had begun procuring long-lead materials and equipment

<<<

 for a potential third vessel. The key commitments involved leg material, thrusters, small cranes, a large crane, engines and generator sets. The Company has been marketing this equipment for sale and during the third quarter sold the large

<<<

 crane and mud pump.

Company Background The Company's principal activities are to build, own and operate purpose-built Elevating Support Vessels (ESVTM units), an innovative new class of self-propelled jack-up rig/vessel hybrids. Each ESV

<<<

 unit is designed to facilitate offshore well intervention activities and workover services for the oil and gas industry. The Company's proprietary ESV technology allows customers to enhance hydrocarbon production from mature wells and fields

<<<

. Vessel size and robust ESV design increase operating efficiency by providing a stable, efficient work environment. Well intervention and facility work benefit from higher utilisation levels (due to reduced sensitivity to weather conditions

<<<

Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited
Notes to the Condensed hterim Financial Information
General Information Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited (the Company) is incorporated under the

<<<

 laws of the Republic of Cyprus, as a limited liability public company. The Company was incorporated on 17 March 2005 and changed its name to Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited on 26 February 2007. The registered office of the Company

<<<

 is located at 284 Arch Makariou III, Fortuna Court, Block B, 3rd Floor, Office 32, 3105 Limassol, Cyprus.
The Company's shares are traded on Oslo Axess under the ticker code "ROFF".
The Group's operations do not have any seasonality or cyclicality

<<<

 effects.
This condensed consolidated interim financial information was authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on 10 November 2009.
This condensed consolidated interim financial information has not been audited.
Basis of Preparation

<<<

 This condensed consolidated interim financial information for the period ended 30 September 2009 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements

<<<

 for the year ended 31 December 2008, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies and computation methods applied are consistent with those of the annual financial

<<<

 statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 as described in those annual financial statements.
Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual earnings.
Various new

<<<

 standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009. The effect of those standards was not material for the condensed interim financial statements except for

<<<

:
· IAS 1 (revised), `Presentation of financial statements'. The revised standard prohibits presenting items of income and expenses (i.e., `non-owner changes in equity') in the statement of changes in equity, requiring `non-owner changes in

<<<

 equity' to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. All `non-owner changes in equity' are required to be shown in a performance statement.
Entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (statement of comprehensive

<<<

 income) or two statements (income statement and statement of comprehensive income).
The Group has elected to present one performance statement: the statement of comprehensive income. Interim financial statements have been prepared under the

<<<

 revised disclosure requirements.
10

Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited
Notes to the Condensed hterim Financial Information
Accounting Policies (Continued) At the date of the approval of these financial statements a number of accounting

<<<

 standards were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but were not yet effective, The effect of those standards is not expected to be material for the Group.
The functional currency of the Group is the US dollar.
The Going Concern

<<<

 Assumption The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As explained in the liquidity position note, the Group requires additional funds in order to complete delivery of its vessels and allow time for contracts for

<<<

 the vessels to be obtained and generate cash flow. As the refinancing proposals would place the Group in a fully financed position for approximately the next twelve months, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis

<<<

. In the event that a refinancing is not successful the Group would be forced to sell assets in a distressed situation and the possible impacts of such sales on the Balance Sheet carrying value are discussed in the Potential Asset Impairment

<<<

 Note.
Liquidity Position The Group is in the development phase. At 30 September 2009, the Company held $56.5 million of funds in escrow to cover future expenditure commitments for constructing and financing the first two vessels and $1.1 million

<<<

 of free cash to cover future operating costs and additional commitments in respect to the first two vessels.
At the end of October 2009, the cash position of the Company was $0.75 million in free cash and $56.5 million in escrow. The Company

<<<

 will require the free cash on hand and anticipated receipts from the sale of OFE concluded in the third quarter to be able to continue its operations through November 2009. The Company expects that the $2.3 million due will be received in part

<<<

 during November with the balance due in December 2009. Thereafter, the Company will require further proceeds from new OFE sales, the release of some of the escrow funds or new equity or loans to support its immediate operations.
The Company

<<<

's operating expenses are around $1 million a month, which will increase to around $2 million a month upon delivery of Remedial ESV Guardian. Without the benefit of customer contracts the Company estimates a forecast cash spend of approximately

<<<

 $70 million (excluding loan interest payments and deferred shipyard payments) to the end of October 2010 based upon forecast remaining gross capital expenditures of $43 million, overheads of $6 million, vessel warm stack expenditures of $1

<<<

4 million and an allowance for mobilisation costs of $7 million. Depending on the timing and location of future contract awards the funding requirement may increase or decrease.
Due to the limited free cash available coupled with the current

<<<

 lack of firm contracts, latest vessel delivery schedules and potential requirements for mobilisation costs, the Company is working with its shareholders and bondholders on options to restructure its financing position and use the $56.5 million

<<<

 funds held in escrow for the most appropriate benefit to the Company. Agreement has been reached with each of COSCO and Yantai (in principle), that the Company may defer $7 million of the delivery payment in respect to each of Remedial ESV

<<<

 Solution and Remedial ESV Guardian for 12 months from delivery provided an acceptable security is provided to each shipyard. These deferred payments will fall due after the end of October 2010.
On 18th September 2009, the Company requested

<<<

 Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, as loan trustee, to summon a bondholders' meeting at which the bondholders would be requested to agree to a deferral of interest on the loan for a period of at least twelve months (to be capitalised to the principal amount

<<<

 of the loan at maturity date), the release of part of the funds in the escrow account for use for general corporate purposes and in return the Company would pay an additional amount to the bondholders by way of a premium equal to 5% of the

<<<

 loan principal at maturity date. On 1st October, upon request from the loan trustee, the Company agreed
11

Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited
Notes to the Condensed Interim Financial Information
Liquidity Position (continued) to defer

<<<

 the call for a bondholders' meeting to permit bondholders to consider and respond to the Company's proposed amendments to the Loan terms. On behalf of the bondholders, the loan trustee engaged a financial advisor (AMA Capital Partners LLC)

<<<

 and a legal adviser (Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP) to perform due diligence of the Company and give advice on the bondholders' position and the proposed amendments. On 30thSeptember 2009, the Company has been informed by the loan trustee

<<<

 that bondholders holding 52% of the loan support retention of these advisers.
The Company was advised by the representatives of the bondholders that the Company's initial proposal would not obtain the acceptance of the bondholders and the Company

<<<

 has ongoing discussions with the representatives in order to agree on a proposal to the bondholders meeting that is likely to be accepted.
Recently an amended proposal has been received from the representatives of the bondholders which would

<<<

 result in a conversion of all indebtedness under the loan other than $56.5 million to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares representing 96 % of the post-restructuring share capital of the Company to the bondholders, a deferral

<<<

 of interest payments, and a release of the escrow monies for shipyard payments (as adjusted for the deferred payments) and general corporate purposes. In addition the proposal allows for an additional debt facility of $13.5 million to be secured

<<<

 against the vessels ranking on an equal basis to the remaining bond loan.
The Company has suggested certain amendments to the proposal from the representatives implying that the indebtedness under the loan other than $56.5 million shall be

<<<

 converted to equity and the issue of new ordinary listed shares to the bondholders representing 94% of the post-restructuring share capital based on an agreed equity value for this 94% of $55,575 million. The Company has further proposed to

<<<

 carry out a rights issue of shares for the aggregate gross subscription price of $20 million at a pre-money equity valuation of $58.5 million (after allowing for the $56.5 million bond loan, the additional $13.5 million of new debt and the

<<<

 $14 million of deferred shipyard payments) for 100% of the equity, for which the current shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe. Following such a rights issue, the bondholders would own approximately 70% of the enlarged share capital and

<<<

 100% of the residual bond.
Either of proposals detailed above would place the Company in a fully financed position for approximately the next twelve months. As of today there is no agreement on either proposal.
The Company has not made the

<<<

 interest payment due 28 September 2009 of $3.1 million, as deferral of the interest payment is one of the proposals for amendment of the loan. The Company is therefore in technical default of the loan.
At 30 September 2009, the Group had cash

<<<

 and cash equivalents of $57.6 million (2008: $113.1 million) of which $1.1 million (2008: $21.4 million) related to cash available for general corporate purposes.
The $210 million bond is repayable in March 2012.

 Company Limited
Notes to the Condensed Interim Financial Information

Potential Asset Impairment In the event the Group is forced to sell off assets in a distressed situation, it is probable that assets would be sold for amounts significantly

<<<

 below their carrying value and certain commitments and contingent liabilities with a maximum value of less than $5m would crystallise. It is estimated the distressed sale price of the vessels under construction could result in an impairment

<<<

 charge of $150m and the sales proceeds would be insufficient to repay the loan secured by the bond. In addition to significant write downs on plant and equipment and OFE held for resale, the intangible assets and derivative financial assets

<<<

 of the Group would likely be fully impaired. In the event that the Group fails to secure client contracts at the rates currently tendered the carrying value of the assets could also be impaired.
Construction in Progress The Company has entered

<<<

 into agreements for construction of two ESVTM units and has purchased and supplied all the OFE for these ESV units. The agreements are with Yantai Raffles Shipyard Limited for Remedial ESV Guardian and with COSCO Nantong for Remedial ESV Solution

<<<

. Under the shipyard contracts the Company is obligated to make interim payments on achievement of progress or physical milestones.

Payments made against these milestones are recorded as construction in progress. The Company had also procured

<<<

 some OFE for a potential third ESV unit. During Q4 2008 management determined construction of a third ESV unit would not take place in the near future and, consequently, agreed to sell the OFE. The OFE was transferred from Construction in Progress

<<<

 and classified as OFE held for sale in the Balance Sheet.

 (31 Dec 2008, $0.1 million) and a $4.9 million (31 Dec 2008, $3.2 million) asset relating to fair value of put and call options within the $210 million bond agreement.
Equity There has been no change in the Company's number of shares during

<<<

 the quarter. At the end of Q3 2009 the Company had 29,440,924 shares (Q2 2008: 29,440,924 shares) in issue with a par value of $0.0025 (Q2 2008: $0.0025).
Operating loss for the period The result for the nine months ended 30 September 2009

<<<

 was a loss of $9.8 million (Q3 2008 loss of $6.6 million). Revenue for the period includes the sale of two small cranes, a large crane and mud pump. The Group received a payment in respect of a reimbursement of certain initial mobilization

<<<

 costs previously incurred and expensed with respect to the potential Chevron Thailand contract. Cost of Sales for the period includes the original cost of the cranes and mud pump sold, commissions paid on the sale of the cranes plus costs incurred

<<<

 for offshore personnel salaries and wages, hiring costs and training. The loss for the period also includes $3.1 million cost relating to the mark to market valuation relating to the interest rate SWAP.
