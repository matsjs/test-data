 Shipping ASA Callable PIK Bond Issue 2007/2012 (formerly ISIN: NO 001 035651.2)
Oslo, 22 December 2014
NOTICE TO BONDHOLDERS - PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT
Nordic Trustee ASA is appointed bond trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the

<<<

 bond issue with ISIN NO 001 069987.9 (formerly NO 001 035651.2) (the "Loan" and the "Bonds") where American Shipping Company ASA (the "Borrower" or "AMSC") is the issuer.
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to

<<<

 them in the loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") entered into on 23 February, 2007 between the Borrower and the Loan Trustee (as later amended and restated by an amendment agreement and restatement agreement dated 27 December 2013), unless

<<<

 otherwise stated in this notice.
The information in this notice regarding the Issuer is provided by the Issuer, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
The Borrower has approached the Loan

<<<

 Trustee to amend a certain provision of the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to Clause 16.2 of the Loan Agreement the Loan Trustee can make decisions regarding changes to the "conditions" of the Loan Agreement, cf. Clause 16.1(c), provided that the

<<<

 amendments are, in the judgement of the Loan Trustee, of minor importance to Bondholders' financial and legal rights in the Loan. Before the Loan Trustee can make such a decision a notice must be sent to the Bondholders describing the proposed

<<<

 amendment, whereby the Bondholders are given the opportunity to protest in writing.
1. Background
Clause 13.3 (h) of the Loan Agreement imposes certain conditions and restrictions on the payment of dividends by AMSC. One of those restrictions

<<<

 is that any dividend be paid within 30 days of a payment date of the BNPP Credit Agreement (which are the quarterly dates upon which principal and interest are payable under the BNPP Credit Agreement). Inother words, as currently worded, Clause

<<<

 13.3 (h) prohibits the payment of dividends by AMSC except during a 30-day window following each quarterly payment date under the BNPP Credit Agreement.
In practice, this restriction has prevented AMSC from following an orderly process of declaring

<<<

 and paying dividends in connection with the reporting of its quarterly results. Typically, AMSC reports its quarterly results 45 to 50 days after quarter end. Preferably, AMSC would like to announce any dividend payment in connection with its

<<<

 quarterly report, and pay the dividend shortly thereafter. However, AMSC is unable to do so within 30 days of the quarter end. Hence, AMSC is currently paying dividend prior to the quarterly result is announced.

Removing the timing restriction

<<<

 (i.e., the 30-day window) on the payment o f dividends is a technical amendment that will have no impact on the Bondholders. Any dividend payment will still be subject to the financial conditions imposed by Clause 13.3(h) and the permitted

<<<

 dividend amounts for 2014, 2015 and the first six months of 2016 will not be changed. AMSC has therefore requested that the Loan Trustee to amend Clause 13.3(h) to eliminate the 30-day window as a restriction on the payment of dividends by

<<<

 AMSC.
2. The Proposal
The Borrower proposes that the Loan Trustee amends the Loan Agreement as follows (the "Proposal"):
a) Existing dividend restrictions in Clause 13.3 (h) of the Loan Agreement is amended by deleting the following part o

<<<

 f the first sentence:
"during the first 30 days following each payment date under the BNPP Credit Agreement (as the term "payment date" is defined therein) . "
3. Loan Trustee's view
The Loan Trustee is o f the view that the Proposal is only

<<<

 a technical change to the Loan Agreement, and that it is only of minor importance to the financial and legal rights of the Bondholders under the Loan Agreement. The total dividend payment limitation will not be changed. Further, the Loan Trustee

<<<

 has received a confirmation from a requisite majority of the Bondholders that they will vote in favour of this Proposal if it is summoned to a Bondholders' Meeting.
4. Bondholders' objections:
Any Bondholder that objects to the Proposal must

<<<

 submit its protest in writing within 2 January 2015 (five business days after this notice was sent, as required by Clause 16.2 o f the Loan Agreement). The Loan Trustee cannot implement the Proposal by its own accord if any Bondholder submits

<<<

 such a protest within the time limit.
The written protest must be dispatched within 2 January 2015 to:
