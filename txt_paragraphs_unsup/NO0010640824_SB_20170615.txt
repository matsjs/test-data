SETTLEMENT WITH OGXPG

Reference is made to the Bondholder Summons issued on 1 February 2017 (the "February Summons"), which provided Bondholders with a general update regarding the status of various matters related to OSX3 and sought

<<<

 Bondholders' approval of OSX3's and the Bond Trustee's entry into a settlement between among others, the Bond Trustee, OSX3 and OGX Petroleo e Gås S.A. - Em Recuperapao Judicial ("OGXPG") (the "Settlement"). Bondholders should consult the February

<<<

 Summons for further background regarding the Settlement.

Pursuant to the Februaiy Summons, the Bond Trustee was authorised by Bondholders to negotiate the terms of, and execute, the definitive documentation required to give effect to the Settlement

<<<

 ("Definitive Documentation") provided that it did not differ materially from the terms set out in the Term Sheet annexed to the February Summons.

In accordance with such authorisation, the Bond Trustee and its advisers, together with OSX3

<<<

, have negotiated with the various settlement counterparties and agreed the terms of the Definitive Documentation.

As contemplated in the February Summons, certain aspects of the Settlement (including as specified in the Term Sheet attached

<<<

 thereto) have required amendment in order to comply with technical, administrative, legal and / or regulatory requirements that have arisen throughout the documentation process. In addition, certain aspects of the Settlement have been amended

<<<

 for commercial and structural or legal reasons.

A summary and brief explanation of the material changes to the terms of the Settlement from the terms set out in the February Summons is set out in the table at Schedule 1 to this Summons. OSX

<<<

3 requests that Bondholders confirm that the changes set out in Schedule 1 are acceptable and that the existing authorisation granted to the Bond Trustee under the February Summons remains valid in respect of the Definitive Documentation.

A

<<<

 fact sheet disclosing certain material facts regarding OGXPG is set out at Schedule 2 to this Summons.

3. OSX3 FUTURE OPERATING EXPENSES

Following OSX3's defaults under the Bond Agreement and its suspension of payments under Dutch law, the

<<<

 Bond Trustee has (on behalf of, and as authorised by, Bondholders) paid specified costs and expenses incurred by OSX3 in order to preserve OSX3's assets (which are secured in favour of the Bond Trustee, on behalf of Bondholders) and ensure

<<<

 that OSX3 continues to operate. These payments include expenses related to the insurance of the OSX-3 ("FPSO"), accounting and legal advice and company director fees, among other things. The Bond Trustee has managed the payment of these creditors

<<<

 in accordance with a Bondholder authorisation granted under a summons dated 16 December 2014.

As noted in the February Summons, the suspension of payments regarding OSX3 has ended and OSX3 is now subject to the full control of its directors

<<<

.

Further, 0SX3 has been receiving charter hire payments from OGX pursuant to the terms of the Settlement (these payments being defined and described as the Excess Payments in the February Summons). To date, OGXPG has paid approximately

<<<

 US$2.1 million on account of charter hire payments, which has been paid by OGXPG directly to the Bond Trustee at the direction of OSX3 to secure payments of the costs of the Bond Trustee and payments made by the Bond Trustee on behalf of OSX

<<<

3. The Bond Trustee currently holds these and other funds (less amounts used to cover costs of the Bond Trustee or payments made on behalf of OSX3) in its client account on behalf of Bondholders (the "Client Account"). In the future, OSX3 intends

<<<

 to receive these (and other) payments into the Escrow Account or a different bank account, which is secured in favour of the Bond Trustee on behalf of Bondholders on terms satisfactoiy to the Bond Trustee (after consulting with its advisers

<<<

) (together the "Security Accounts").
Depending on the level of oil production and sales from TBMT (defined in the February Summons), OSX3 should continue to receive these charter hire payments while the FPSO remains operational on TBMT.
Given

<<<

 these circumstances, OSX3 proposes to resume management of payment of its own creditors and suppliers. In order to do so, OSX3 proposes to Bondholders (the "Operating Funding Proposal") that:
(a) OSX3 will prepare and submit to the Bond Trustee

<<<

, no later than fifteen (15) Business Days before the end of each calendar quarter, a request for funding setting out its current cash balance and aggregate forecast expenses for the following calendar quarter (together with such other explanations

<<<

 or information as the Bond Trustee requires) (the "Quarterly Funding Request");
(b) to the extent permitted by the relevant account bank, OSX3 will grant a security interest (satisfactory to the Bond Trustee) in favour of the Bond Trustee,

<<<

 on behalf of the Bondholders, over the operating account which is to be used to pay all amounts specified in the Quarterly Funding Request (the "Operating Account");
(c) the Bond Trustee shall be authorised and instructed, but not obliged,

<<<

 by the Bondholders to consent to the release of funds from the Security Accounts (or, alternatively, to transfer funds from the Client Account if necessaiy) to the Operating Account in an amount sufficient to meet all of OSX3's forecast cash

<<<

 flow requirements as specified in the latest Quarterly Funding Request submitted to the Bond Trustee, provided that:
(i) no more than $500,000 is transferred to OSX3 in respect of any calendar quarter;
(ii) the aggregate of all funds transferred

<<<

 to OSX3 pursuant to the Operating Funding Proposal does not exceed:
(1) $2,000,000; and
-3 -

(2) 50% of the aggregate funds standing to the credit of the Client Account and the Security Accounts at the time of such transfer; and
(iii) the

<<<

 Bond Trustee is satisfied that it will be able to meet all of its forecast costs, expenses and other liabilities incurred in connection with the Bonds out of the funds standing to the credit of the Client Account following the transfer or release

<<<

 (as applicable) of funds in accordance with the relevant Quarterly Funding Request.
Further, in accordance with the terms of the Settlement, OSX3 will be obliged to make a cash contribution to NewCo (as defined in the Februaiy Summons) in an

<<<

 amount of approximately $700,000 in order to fund the anticipated costs and expenses of NewCo. This amount will be provided to OSX3 by the Bond Trustee out of funds standing to the credit of the Client Account (provided the Bond Trustee is

<<<

 satisfied that, following such payment, it will have sufficient funds available to it in the Client Account to meet all of its forecast costs, expenses and other liabilities incurred in connection with the Bonds).
4. THE PROPOSAL
Based on the

<<<

 matters set out above, the Issuer proposes that Bondholders:
(a) approve the changes to the terms of the Settlement, as summarised in Schedule 1, and confirm that the authorisation and instructions given to the Bond Trustee under the February

<<<

 Summons remain valid and effective (which authorisation and instruction includes negotiating any further amendment to, or completing details in connection with, the Definitive Documentation provided it is consistent with the February Summons

<<<

 as updated by the matters set out in Annexure A to this Summons); and
(b) authorise and instruct the Bond Trustee to negotiate the terms of and agree, execute and deliver such documents as the Bond Trustee considers necessary or desirable to

<<<

 give effect to the Operating Funding Proposal, in consultation with its advisers and without the need to seek further approval or instructions from Bondholders,
(the "Proposal").
5. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
The Proposal set out in this Summons

<<<

 is put to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable to them.
Bondholders holding in excess of 66 2/3% of the Voting Bonds

<<<

 have indicated to the Bond Trustee that they are supportive of the Proposal set out above.

Schedule 1 Material Amendments to Settlement Terms
Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in the table below

 have the meaning given to them in the February Summons and the Term Sheet attached thereto.

1 (.Aggregate holdings) The Term Sheet specifies that OSX3, the DIP OGXPG is obliged under its articles of association and the Brazilian

Holders and

<<<

 the IF Lenders will receive, in aggregate, 95% of the total listing rules to provide all of its existing shareholders with a right of pre

pro-forma post-restructuring equity in OGXPG following the payment emption to acquire any shares issued

 by OGXPG pursuant to a capital

and conversion of their respective debt claims.

increase approved by the board of directors of OGXPG ("Pre-Emption

Rights"). The process for payment of the OSX3 charter claims and the

IF Lenders' claims requires

<<<

 the board of OGXPG to approve a capital

increase in order to pay those claims with equity in OGXPG.

To the extent that any Pre-Emption Rights are exercised by the existing shareholders of OGXPG, which OGXPG does not expect to occur due to

<<<

 the implied issuance price per new share in OGXPG, then the aggregate number of OGXPG shares issued to OSX3, the DIP Holders and the IF Lenders will be reduced and the number of shares attributed to each Participating Creditor will be adjusted

<<<

 downwards proportionally to reflect this. Each Participating Creditor will be paid its pro rata proportion of the cash proceeds paid to OGXPG from the exercise of any Pre-Emption Rights by existing shareholders.

In summary, while it is not

<<<

 expected, the aggregate number of shares issued to the Participating Creditors may ultimately be equal to less than 95% of the fully-diluted post-restructuring equity in OGXPG, such difference being supplemented with cash paid by existing OGXPG

<<<

 shareholders who exercise pre-emptive rights to be distributed among all

# Original Term
2 (Eneva Shares) The Term Sheet specifies that the DIP Holders and the IF Lenders will receive, in aggregate, one-third of all Eneva Shares currently

<<<

 held by OGXPG. OSX3 will receive a further one-third of all Eneva Shares currently held by OGXPG, which shares were to be deposited into an escrow account designated for payment of costs and expenses associated with disconnection and redelivery

 of the FPSO to OSX3.

Summary of Material Change Participating Creditors.
OGXPG is party to a shareholder's agreement with Cambuhy IFundo de Investimento em Participagoes ("Cambuhy") pursuant to which it is obliged to provide Cambuhy

<<<

 with a right of first refusal to acquire all of the Eneva Shares that OGXPG intends to sell or otherwise dispose of to a third party, which includes the Eneva Shares designated to the Participating Creditors under the Settlement.
As such, if

<<<

 Cambuhy exercises its right of first refusal and acquires all of the Eneva Shares designated to the Participating Creditors under the Settlement, the Participating Creditors will not receive any Eneva Shares under the terms of the Settlement

<<<

. Instead, each of the DIP Holders and IF Lenders would be paid its pro rata proportion of the cash proceeds paid to OGXPG from the exercise of the right of first refusal by Cambuhy, and the cash proceeds attributable to OSX3 in respect of its

<<<

 proportion of the Eneva Shares would be deposited into the Escrow Account.
In the event that the right of first refusal is not exercised by Cambuhy, OSX3 will receive and hold its proportion of the Eneva Shares directly and will not deposit

<<<

 them into an escrow account. Instead, OSX3 will grant a call option in favour of OGX to acquire the Eneva Shares for $1.00 once all disconnection and redelivery obligations have been satisfied by OGXPG. The Eneva Shares held by OSX3 will fall

 outside the scope of the Bond Trustee's security over OSX3's assets, which is consistent with the Term Sheet.
