 Agreement (the "Loan Instrument"), the interest on the pledged Loan Instrument was according to the Issuer incorrectly set to 7.50 per cent per annum. Adapta Kongahalla AB, being the debtor under the Loan Instrument (and the Issuer being the

<<<

 creditor), does not generate cash today and will not generate cash until Adapta Kongahalla AB's tenants starts paying rents, which is anticipated to be in Q2 2019. According to the terms o f the Loan Pledge Agreement, the Loan Instrument may

 not be amended.
For the above reason, the Issuer has requested the Agent to agree to amend the Loan Instrument in regard to the interest so that the interest is set to 0.00 per cent per annum until Adapta Kongahalla AB starts to generate cash

<<<

. As consideration for approving the amendment, the Issuer will transfer an amount equal to SEK 21,000,000 (corresponding to the interest payable during one year) to a bank account pledged to the Bondholders as security for the Issuer's obligations

 under the Bonds. From and including Q2 2018 an amount o f SEK 5,250,000 will be released from the pledged account at the end of each quarter and the interest under the Loan Instrument will be set back to 7.5 per cent per annum when Adapta Kongahalla

Further, the Issuer has requested the Agent to agree to amend
