INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1.1

Merger between the Issuer and SPP Liv Fondförsäkring AB (publ)

As previously communicated

<<<

 through a press release on 20 May 2014, the board of directors of the Issuer and SPP Liv Fondförsäkring AB (publ), Reg. No. 516401-8599, ("SPP Fondliv") adopted a joint merger plan on 19 May 2014, whereby SPP Fondliv shall assume all the Issuer

<<<

's assets and liabilities by way of a merger (the "Merger"). On 23 June 2014, the merger plan was approved by the general meeting of the Issuer. The merger consideration will consist of new shares in SPP Fondliv, issued to the current sole shareholder

<<<

 of both the Issuer and SPP Fondliv, Storebrand Holding AB. Thus, the Merger will not affect the ownership structure of SPP Fondliv.

The Merger takes effect when the Swedish Companies Registration Office registers the Merger, at which point

<<<

 the Issuer will cease to exist. Provided that the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw. Finansinspektionen) approves the execution of the merger plan, the Issuer and SPP Fondliv aim to register the Merger no later than 2 January 201

<<<

5.

The Merger entails a change of issuer in relation to the Notes. With reference to clause 18.5(e) of the Terms and Conditions, such change requires certain majority consent of the Noteholders.

1.2

Background and rationale for the Merger

<<<



The Issuer was incorporated in 1994 and SPP Fondliv was incorporated in 1995, both as subsidiaries of Alecta. SPP Fondliv and the Issuer are since December 2007 part of the Storebrand group and are currently directly owned by Storebrand Holding

<<<

 AB. The division of the business of the Issuer and SPP Fondliv in two separate companies was originally motivated by regulatory restrictions. Until l April 2013, SPP Fondliv outsourced its functions to the Issuer where the operative business

<<<

 was

2

conducted. From 1 April 2013, the major part of the Issuer's operations and members of staff were transferred to SPP Fondliv.

SPP Liv's portfolio of traditional insurance is expected to decrease in the coming years, while SPP Fondliv

<<<

 shows strong growth. The Merger implies a more simple corporate structure and organisation, and facilitates a more cost-efficient administration of the business.

The Merger will also contribute to diversify risks, which is expected to result

<<<

 in a lower capital requirement when implementing the Solvency II framework.

As of 30 June 2014, the solvency ratio according to Solvency I was 2.11 in SPP Liv and 2.26 in SPP Fondliv. Should SPP Liv and SPP Fondliv have been merged as of that

<<<

 date, the merged solvency ratio should have been 2.13 at that date. The subordinated notes are included in this calculation of the capital base, and affect the merged solvency ratio by 0.16.

Upon registration of the Merger with the Swedish

<<<

 Companies Registration Office, the subordinated notes issued by SPP Liv will be transferred to SPP Fondliv, and the terms and conditions governing the subordinated notes will remain the same.

SPP Fondliv has applied to the Swedish Financial

<<<

 Supervisory Authority for approval to take the subordinated loan (Sw. förlagslån), evidenced by the Notes, into account when calculating its capital base.

SPP Fondliv has (prior to the Merger) no external funding, and the shareholders' equity

<<<

 as per 30 June 2014 amounted to MSEK 1,359.

1.3

Further information in relation to the Merger

The Merger is subject to approval from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.

SPP Fondliv also intends to change its name to "SPP Pension

<<<

 & Försäkring AB (publ)" in connection with the Merger.

2

THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE CHANGE OF ISSUER

2.1

Proposal

The Issuer proposes that the Noteholders approve the change of issuer, as a result of the Merger, referred to above (the

<<<

 "Proposal").

2.2

Effectiveness

The decision to approve the Proposal shall be effective from the date of the Noteholder's approval.

2.3

Non-Reliance

The Proposal is presented to the Noteholders without evaluation or recommendations from

<<<

 the Agent. The Noteholders must independently evaluate whether the above decision to approve the Proposal is acceptable.

3

THE WRITTEN

PROCEDURE

The following instructions need to be adhered to under the Written Procedure.

3.1 Final date

<<<

 to participate in the Written Procedure

The Agent must receive the Voting Form no later than 5.00 p.m. (CET), 4 November 2014, by mail, via courier or e-mail to the addresses indicated below. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.

3.2

Decision procedure

The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate under the Written Procedure as valid votes.

When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received

<<<

 by the Agent, the decision to approve the Proposal shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.

Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure will: i) be

<<<

 sent by notice to the Noteholders, ii) be published as a press release, and iii) be published on the websites of a) the Issuer and b) the Agent.

A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Noteholders, irrespective

<<<

 of them responding in the Written Procedure

3.3

Voting right and authorization

Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (28 October 2014) in the debt register:

(i) be registered as a direct registered

<<<

 owner of a securities account; or

(ii) be registered as authorized nominee in a securities account, with respect to one or several Notes.

3.4 Notes registered with a nominee

If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your

<<<

 Notes are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Notes.

1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your

<<<

 behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.

2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney/Authorization, Schedule 2, from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorization. If you hold

<<<

 your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorization directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as holder of the securities account, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting

<<<

 with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a holder of the securities account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.

Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between

<<<

 you and the authorized nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).

The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Notes

<<<

 on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Notes are registered or need authorization or other assistance to participate. Notes owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an

<<<

 Affdiate do not entitle to any voting rights.

3.5

Quorum

To approve the Proposal, Noteholders representing at least 50 per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum

<<<

. If a quorum

4

does not exist in respect of the first Written Procedure, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure and present the Proposal to the Noteholders once more. The quorum requirements shall not apply to such second Written

<<<

 Procedure. All replies/votes from the first Written Procedure will remain valid on the second Written Procedure, unless they have been explicitly withdrawn (for the avoidance of doubt, the person that replied on the first Written Procedure

<<<

 must also be qualified to vote on the second Written Procedure for the vote to remain eligible).

3.6

Majority

To approve the Proposal, Noteholders representing at least 80 per cent of the Noteholders which are required to reply to the request

<<<

 in accordance with Clause 3.5 (Quorum) above must consent to the decision to approve the Proposal.

3.7

Addresses for sending replies

Return the Voting Form, Schedule 1, and, if applicable, the Power of Attorney/Authorisation in Schedule

<<<

 2 or other sufficient evidence, if the Notes are held in custody other than Euroclear Sweden, by regular mail, scanned copy by e-mail, or by courier to:
