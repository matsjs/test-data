 seek the approval from First North Stockholm or Nasdaq Stockholm or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non disclosure agreement with the Trustee, in order to be able to timely inform the Trustee according to Clause

<<<

 of principal.

13.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 13.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a

corresponding distribution in accordance

<<<

 with Clause 13.1.

13.3

the Bonds constitute escrow funds according to the Escrow Funds Act and must be held on a
