<<<

 A SA (the "Bond Trustee") on 5 November 2013 at 13:00 CET.

Capitalized terms used in this letter shall unless expressly defined herein have the meaning assigned to them in the Summons.

The Sum m ons and term sheet attached thereto presented

<<<

 the proposed terms of the Issuer's refinancing plan for the Noreco group (the "Refinancing Proposal") as announced on 21 October 2013, including a change in the overall bond structure, as well as an equity issue in the amount of up to NO K

For the Bond Issues, the Refinancing Proposal means that the Bonds are rolled into the following new bond loans in

together referred to as the "New Bonds" and "New Bond Issues".

2.

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS

The Issuer refers to the press releases issued at 8:29 and 17:12 today, 4 November 2013, through Oslo Bors (available

<<<

 on www.newsweb.no), in which the Issuer has provided an update on the Refinancing Proposal and announced certain amendments to the terms presented in the Summons.

The Company has through communication with a wide range of Bondholders clarified

<<<

 that there is a high level of support for the Refinancing Proposal. The Company has also been able to raise subscriptions for NOK 430 million in the initial equity issue. Some Bondholders, and especially Bondholders in the NOR05 Bond and the

<<<

 NOR08 Bond, which both are due for final repayment in December 2013, have however expressed scepticism to the Refinancing Proposal. Having carefully considered all input that have been brought forward, the Company has today resolved to amend

<<<

 the Refinancing Proposal as follows:

· The terms of the new Convertible Bond loan included a conversion option in years 4 and 5. These terms will be changed to allow for conversion by holders at any time during the term of the loan.
« The

<<<

 terms of the new Second Lien Bond included a tenor of 7 years. This will be changed to a tenor of 5.5 years, by the Company hereby declaring that it will call the loan after such time. Such call will be made at the prevailing call premium 

<<<

(being 102% ).
· The terms of the new Second Lien Bond included a PIK interest option for the Company with respect to 50% of the incurred interest in 2014. This option will be removed, by the Company hereby declaring that it will not exercise

<<<

 such option.
These amendments will not have any impact on the Huntington and Denmark Bond or the Oselvar Bond, and does in the Company's opinion not change the overall balance or robustness of the Refinancing Proposal. The reduced tenor implies

<<<

 an amortization on the Second Lien Bond of NOK 100m in year 4, NOK 200m in year 5, and NOK 436m at maturity. The removal of the PIK interest option will imply a potential impact on the cash position of the Company of around NOK 25m in 2014

<<<

, but will reduce the interest cost and debt outstanding in the following years. It is in this respect also noted that the Company through

equity raised have subscriptions for the full amount of NOK 430 million, NOK 30 million above the minimum

<<<

 threshold. The amendment to the terms of the convertible bond should be positive for all creditors, as it gives a potentially larger equity cushion and reduced debt level.
As required by the Company's financial position, it is of vital importance

<<<

 for the Company not to delay the Bondholders' Meetings scheduled for 5 November 2013. The Bondholders' Meetings will therefore proceed as planned and summoned for all the Bonds. To enable this and to avoid summoning of new meetings, the Issuer

<<<

 has issued this letter in order to document to the relevant Bond Trustee and the Bondholders that it irrevocably stands behind the above changes and commitments, provided that the Bondholder Meetings resolve the Refinancing Proposal.
Undertakings

<<<

 with respect to the Second Lien Bond: Consequently and on the above basis, the Issuer hereby undertakes (the "Undertakings") to the Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders as follows:
(i) The Issuer irrevocably undertake not to exercise the

<<<

 option provided to the Com pany under the terms of the Second Lien Bond allowing 5 0 % of the interest accruing in 2014 to be paid in kind (PIK) and thus all interest accrued on the Second Lien Bond will be paid by the Issuer in cash on the

<<<

 relevant interest payment dates.
(ii) The Issuer irrevocably undertake to exercise the call option with respect to all outstanding Second Lien Bonds at the latest by the date five years and s'tx months after the settlement date of the New Bonds

<<<

, acknowledging that the Second Lien Bonds will be redeemed at a price equal to at least the prevailing call premium (at five years and sb< months being 1 0 2 % of par value).
The Company will in addition intend to call for a bondholders' meeting

<<<

 in the Second Lien Bond shortly following the Settlement Date in order to formalise the Undertakings directly in the relevant bond agreement by removing the option for the Company to accrue any PIK interest in 2014 and amending the tenor of

<<<

 the Second Lien Bond to five years and six months, with a repayment of the outstanding Second Lien Bonds on the maturity date at 1 02% of par value. It is important to note, however, that such bondholders' meeting will not be a condition for

<<<

 the implementation of the Refinancing Proposal and the validity of the Undertakings.
Amendment with respect to the Convertible Bond: On the same basis as the Company has provided the Undertakings, it has as set out above proposed one amendment

<<<

 (the "Amendment") to the Refinancing Proposal with respect to the period during which the Convertible Bonds may be converted into shares of the Company, as follows:

sl

The Convertible Bonds are convertible for the holders into shares of

<<<

 the Issuer at any time from the Settlement Date until the date falling five years after the Issuer's formal board resolution to issue the Convertible Bonds or, in the event of extended authorisation to (but not including) the Final Maturity

<<<

 Date (i.e. not only from three years after the Settlement Date) at a price per com m on share equal to three times (3x) the issue price of the Equity Issue.
This Amendment is deemed positive for all Bondholders and other creditors, as it gives

<<<

 a potentially higher equity level and corresponding reduced debt level. The Company has on this basis and after consultation with the Bond Trustee resolved to implement the Amendment directly in the Refinancing Proposal that will be voted over

<<<

 in the Bondholder Meetings and thus included in the relevant bond agreement from the Settlement Date.

3.

EQUITY RECONFIRMATION

Other than as described herein, the terms and conditions of the Refinancing Proposal to be resolved in the Bondholder

<<<

 Meetings are unchanged. This means that the implementation of the New Bond Issues is subject to e.g. approval by the Company's extraordinary general meeting on 15 November 2013 and completion of the Private Placement. Bondholders should be

<<<

 aware that the subscriptions in the Private Placement will have to be reconfirmed as a consequence of the amendments and undertakings described herein. To the extent any of the subscribers will not grant such reconfirmation, new investors will

<<<

 have to be sought to take a stake in the Private Placement.

The Company's two main shareholders and largest subscribers in the Private Placement, IKM Industri-Invest AS and Sabaro Investments Ltd, have given a pre-approval.

Bondholders may

<<<

 contact the Advisers as follows for further information: Arctic Securities ASA, Fixed Income Sales at + 47 21 01 30 60; Pareto Securities AS, Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70; or
