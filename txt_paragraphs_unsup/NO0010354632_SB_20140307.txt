Oslo, 7 March 2014
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
1. INTRODUCTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders"

<<<

) of the USD 130,000,000 FRN Sea Production Limited Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Sea Production Ltd (the "Company"). The terms and conditions of the Bonds are set out in the bond agreement

<<<

 dated 9 February 2007 between the Company and the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) as amended on 23 July 2010 and 23 August 2010, and as amended and restated on 21 March 2012 and 2 July 2012 (the "Bond Agreement").
All capitalised

<<<

 terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the amended and restated Bond Agreement attached at Schedule 1 (the "Amended and Restated Bond Agreement") or this summons (the "Summons"), unless otherwise stated.
The information

<<<

 in this Summons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status o f the Company is provided by the Company, and the Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
Bondholders are encouraged to read this

<<<

 Summons in its entirety.
2. BACKGROUND
In recent years, the Company has experienced certain operational challenges which have materially impacted its profitability and cash flow. Accordingly, the Company is proposing to amend the terms of the

<<<

 Bond Agreement and, to this end, has been in discussions with an informal ad-hoc committee of bondholders holding in excess of 66 2/3% of the principal amount of the outstanding Bonds (collectively, the "Committee").
In general terms, the Company

<<<

 seeks to amend the terms of the Bond Agreement for the main purpose of the postponement of the Maturity Date until 14 May 2015. In return, the Bondholders shall be compensated with, among other things, the payment of a Restructuring Fee, an

<<<

 increase in the cash interest rate on the Bonds and an increase in the interest in kind rate on the Bonds.

The proposed changes are summarised in the term sheet attached at Schedule 2 (the "Term Sheet"). Also, for completeness, please see the proposed Amended and Restated Bond Agreement

<<<

 attached at Schedule 1, which has been prepared on the basis of the Term Sheet, for further details. It is attached in a form which is blacklined against the current form of the Bond Agreement for ease of reference.
Separately, the Company

<<<

 has also been in the process of arranging for the reflagging of the Vessel FPSO Crystal Ocean, owned by Wisdom, from Cayman Islands to Panama (the "Reflagging"). The Reflagging will involve de-registering the Vessel from the Cayman Islands

<<<

 Registry of Ships and immediately thereafter, registering the Vessel with the Panamanian Registry of Ships, and accordingly replacing the existing Cayman Islands law Vessel Mortgage with a new Panamanian law Vessel Mortgage. The Company has

<<<

 agreed to the Reflagging for operational reasons, at the request of the charterers of the Vessel. Even though technically no Bondholder approval is required for the Reflagging, it has been decided that this should be approved as part of the

<<<

 Bondholders' meeting considering that other amendments have also been proposed to be made to the Bond Agreement. The Bond Trustee has taken legal advice that from the perspective of Singaporean law (the jurisdiction where the owner of the Vessel

<<<

, Wisdom, is incorporated) there is no obvious insolvency claw-back risk as a result of the Reflagging and the replacement of the Vessel Mortgage.
3. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
Based on the foregoing, the Company hereby asks the Bondholders' meeting

<<<

 to approve the following proposal (the "Proposal"):
Amendments to the Bond Agreement
The Bond Agreement shall be amended and restated in accordance with the proposed Amended and Restated Bond Agreement attached at Schedule 1, subject to any

<<<

 further non material changes that are agreed between the Company and the Bond Trustee (or its legal advisors).
Conditions
The coming into effect of the Amended and Restated Bond Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the

<<<

 following documents and conditions precedent (each to be in form and content acceptable to the Bond Trustee, acting reasonably), including the following:
(a) Receipt by the Bond Trustee of certified copies of the following:
(i) the articles

<<<

 of association and certificate of incorporation of the Borrower and each Guarantor;
(ii) corporate resolutions of the Borrower and each Guarantor approving the Proposal and the entry into and execution of an amendment agreement (the "Amendment

<<<

 Agreement") (and with that the Amended and Restated Bond Agreement) and such other documents as shall be entered into and executed as a consequence of the Proposal; and
UKDOCS/1517344.2

(iii) if

<<<

 not included in the resolution referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) above, a power of attorney to the representatives of the Borrower and each other member of the Group for the execution of the Amendment Agreement (and with that the Amended

<<<

 and Restated Bond Agreement) and such other documents as shall need to be executed and registered as a consequence of the Proposal.
(b) The Bond Trustee having received from the Borrower such financial information about the Borrower and any

<<<

 other member of the Group as the Bond Trustee may require.
(c) Receipt of such legal opinion(s) (as to corporate authority) addressed to the Bond Trustee as the Bond Trustee shall reasonably require.
(d) Payment of the fees, costs and expenses

<<<

 of the Bond Trustee and its advisors in connection with the negotiation, agreement and implementation of the Proposal and any other outstanding fees, costs and expenses of the Bond Trustee and its advisors, as well as all fees, costs and expenses

<<<

 related to the Reflagging.
Reflagging
The Company and its Group shall complete the Reflagging and enter into any related documentation, including a new Vessel Mortgage under Panamanian law to replace the existing Vessel Mortgage under Cayman

<<<

 Islands law, an amended and restated Deed of Covenants to reflect the Reflagging and any other necessary documentation or authorisations.
4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSALS
The Borrower's evaluation:
In the Company's opinion, the requests are fair

<<<

 and will provide the long-term flexibility required to enhance the Company's business and financial conditions and prospects. The Company believes that the Proposal also improves the likelihood of a successful refinancing at maturity. Concurrently

<<<

, the Proposal provides the Bondholders with an increased margin to improve the credit profile of the Loan.
The Company advises that any enquiries may be directed to Mr. Michael Staheyeff, Director, at telephone +65 6309 2888.
Non-reliance of

<<<

 the Bond Trustee:
The proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee or the Committee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

<<<

 It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal and financial advisers regarding the effect of the proposals.
