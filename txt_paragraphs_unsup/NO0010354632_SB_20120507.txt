<<<

 Ltd. (the "Company") is the issuer and borrower,

All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Loan (the "Loan Agreement") between the Company and the Loan Trustee

BACKGROUND

On 6 July 2010 a summons was issued to seek Bondholder consent to the sale of the Aframax tanker "M/V Sea Jaguar" (the "Sea Jaguar") by Melrose Shipping Company

<<<

 Limited ("Melrose") and to various waivers related to the sale process. Bondholders consented to the sale and waived a requirement within the Loan Agreement that Bonds of par value USD 7,500,000 be redeemed by the Company upon any sale of the

<<<

 Sea Jaguar. Bondholders also consented to the release of all security and guarantees relating to the Sea Jaguar or Melrose previously granted under the Loan Agreement, such security and guarantees consisting of: (i) a mortgage over Sea Jaguar

<<<

; (ii) an assignment of insurances; (iii) a guarantee and indemnity provided by Melrose; and (iv) a pledge by the Company over its shares in Melrose (together, the "Melrose Security").

On 27 January 2012 a summons was issued to seek Bondholder

<<<

 consent to the sale of the Aframax tanker "M/V Sea Cat" (the "Sea Cat") by Langford Shipping Company Limited ("Langford") and to various waivers related to the sale process. Bondholders consented to the sale and waived a requirement within

<<<

 the Loan Agreement that Bonds of par value USD 7,500,000 be redeemed by the Company upon any sale of the Sea Cat, but they did not provide express consent to the release of any security and guarantees relating to the Sea Cat or Langford previously

<<<

 granted under the Loan Agreement, such security and guarantees consisting of: (i) a mortgage over Sea Cat; (ii) an assignment of insurances; (iii) a guarantee and indemnity provided by Langford; and (iv) a pledge by the Company over its shares

<<<

 in Langford (together, the "Langford Security").

As a result of certain operational challenges which have materially impacted the profitability and cash flow of the Company, a summons was issued on 12 March 2012 to seek Bondholder consent

<<<

 to an amendment of the Loan Agreement pursuant to which, amongst other things, the Maturity

NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
Date of the Bonds was to be postponed until 14 February 2014. This proposal was approved and the amendment and restatement of the Loan Agreement became effective on 26 March 2012. Under the Loan Agreement, both

<<<

 Langford and Melrose are required to issue new guarantees in favour of the Loan Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders) and enter into the Inter-Company Liabilities Security and Subordination Agreement within 45 days of such effective date.
Following

<<<

 the sales of the Sea Jaguar and the Sea Cat, neither Melrose nor Langford has any operating assets and the Company therefore proposes to commence liquidation/windingup/striking off proceedings in respect of these entities in order to reduce

<<<

 ongoing administrative expenses.
Given the above background, the Company is proposing to amend the terms of the Loan Agreement and, to this end, has been in discussions with an informal ad-hoc committee of bondholders holding 93.85% of the

<<<

 principal amount of the outstanding Bonds (collectively, the "Committee").
In general terms, the Company seeks to amend the terms of the Loan Agreement to provide that:
· Melrose and Langford may enter into winding-up, liquidation or strike

<<<

 off proceedings; and
· neither Melrose nor Langford is required to provide any new guarantees or enter into any new agreements under the Loan Agreement or to continue to provide any of the Melrose Security or Langford Security so long as (a

<<<

) Melrose and Langford remain dormant and do not own any material assets, or (b) the Company actively pursues the winding-up, liquidation or striking off of Melrose and Langford in good faith.
The Company also seeks Bondholder approval to release

<<<

 the Langford Security and to ratify any release of Langford Security that may have been previously undertaken in connection with the sale of the Sea Cat and to irrevocably waive any Events of Default that may have arisen as a result of such

<<<

 action.
Separately, under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company is required to grant new or supplemental share charges or pledges over all its shares in each of Puffin Ltd ("Puffin") and Wisdom Shipping (S) Pte Ltd ("Wisdom") and procure

<<<

 that each of Puffin and Wisdom provide new unconditional guarantees securing all the payment obligations of the Company under the Loan Agreement. Amendments to the mortgages over the FPSO vessels Front Puffin and Crystal Ocean must also be

<<<

 executed by Puffin and Wisdom to reflect the granting of these new guarantees and it is acknowledged that this requirement may also be fulfilled by the granting of supplementary mortgages in the alternative (the mortgage amendments and/or new

<<<

 or supplementary mortgages, the new unconditional guarantees and the new or supplemental share charges or pledges, together the "New Security"). The Company does not wish to duplicate existing security and seeks Bondholder approval to release

<<<

 the existing charges or pledges over the shares in each of Puffin and Wisdom and to release the existing guarantees (and existing mortgages, if appropriate and to the extent new mortgages have been granted) provided by each of Puffin and Wisdom

<<<

 (together, the "Existing Security") as soon as reasonably possible once 180 days have elapsed from the date of the granting of the New Security comprising new share charges or pledges, new unconditional guarantees and mortgage amendments and

<<<

/or new or supplementary mortgages in relation to Puffin and Wisdom, provided that the Company certifies to the Loan Trustee, at the time of such release, that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of the proposed release

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

The Company has been progressing the various conditions subsequent

<<<

 set out within clauses 8.4 to 8.7 and clause 8,9 of the Loan Agreement which include the granting of the New Security and amendments to the bye-laws of both Puffin and Wisdom. Certain discussions regarding these conditions have taken longer

<<<

 than anticipated, however, and the Company seeks an extension to the 45 day time limit (commencing from the effective date of the Loan Agreement) within which it must complete all of the actions set out within clauses 8.4 - 8.7 and clause 

<<<

8.9 of the Loan Agreement. The Company therefore seeks Bondholder approval to amend the Loan Agreement so that all references to "45 days" within these clauses are replaced with references to "55 days", save for the requirement under clause

<<<

 8.4 to execute an Assignment of Earnings in relation to FPSO Front Puffin within 45 days of FPSO Front Puffin entering into a bareboat charter or other contract for hire or employment of a similar nature, which shall not be amended.
Finally

<<<

, the Company is also proposing an amendment to the Front Puffin Assignment of Insurances and the Crystal Ocean Assignment of Insurances that were previously granted by Puffin and Wisdom, Under these assignments as drafted, all claims exceeding

<<<

 USD 500,000 are to be paid to the Loan Trustee rather than Puffin or Wisdom (as appropriate). The Company has proposed that all amounts paid out under the insurance policies, prior to the declaration by the Loan Trustee of an Event of Default

<<<

 which is continuing, should be paid to Puffin or Wisdom, as appropriate, for the purposes of repair and maintenance of the relevant vessel(s) and ensuring that the Company remains in compliance with its maintenance obligations under the Loan

<<<

 Agreement. The Loan Agreement does not require that all amounts over USD 500,000 automatically be paid to the Loan Trustee and the Company therefore wishes to remove this provision in both the Front Puffin Assignment of Insurances and the Crystal

<<<

 Ocean Assignment of Insurances.
