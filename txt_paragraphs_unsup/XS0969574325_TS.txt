 of the financial condition and affairs, and its own appraisal of the creditworthiness, of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor. Neither this Drawdown Prospectus nor any other information supplied in connection with the offering of the Notes constitutes

<<<

 an offer by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Guarantor or any of the Joint Lead Managers to any person to subscribe for or to purchase any Notes.

 access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;

 financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including Notes with principal or interest payable in one or more currencies, or where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from

<<<

 adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

<<<

. A potential investor should not invest in Notes which are complex financial instruments unless it has the expertise (either alone or with a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting

<<<

 effects on the value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment portfolio.

 it, (2) the Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to

<<<

 determine the appropriate treatment of the Notes under any applicable risk based capital or similar rules.

RISK FACTORS The Issuer

<<<

 believes that the factors set out in the section entitled "Risk Factors" on pages 11 to 29 of the Offering Circular as incorporated by reference into this Drawdown Prospectus may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes

<<<

. Most of those factors are contingencies and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. In addition, factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated

<<<

 with Notes issued under the Programme are described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" on pages 11 to 29 of the Offering Circular as incorporated by reference into this Drawdown Prospectus. The Issuer believes that those factors represent

<<<

 the principal risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but the inability of the Issuer to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with any Notes may occur for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks

<<<

 by the Issuer based on information currently available to it or which it may not currently be able to anticipate. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Drawdown Prospectus and the documents

<<<

 incorporated by reference herein and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
