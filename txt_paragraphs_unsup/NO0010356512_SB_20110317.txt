Background to accompany Summons for Bondholders Meeting
American Shipping Company ASA's (the "Company

<<<

" or "AMSC") fleet has grown to nine with the delivery of our ninth product tanker on August 31, 2010. The last vessel in our ten vessel order with Aker Philadelphia Shipyard ("AKPS") is scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2011.

American Shipping Company ASA will continue to focus on achieving the conditions required for extending our bareboat charters to December 2019 (from charters that currently expire between 2014 and 2016) per the settlement agreement with OSG

<<<

 (see the 2009 Annual Report for more information on the settlement agreement with OSG.).
The Company is subject to foreign exchange risk associated with the value of the Norwegian Kroner to the U.S. dollar, particularly due to the fact that

<<<

 the Loan is denominated in Norwegian Kroner while AM SC's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The impact on this strengthening is that it creates a foreign exchange loss to the Company, thus having a negative impact on our equity. Therefore

<<<

, based on this development, American Shipping Company ASA is seeking a reduction of the Equity requirement of USD 140 million set out in Clause 13.2 of the Loan Agreement to USD 80 million. At 31 December 2010 our equity position was USD 1

<<<

54 million (according to the Bondholders' meeting resolution of 25 February 2009, the Equity is computed disregarding the effect of interest hedging arrangements).
