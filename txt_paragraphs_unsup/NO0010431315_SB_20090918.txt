 However, the total amount is very large and the transaction risk is considered to be high -- Complete corporate re-financing is complex and challenging within required timeline -- Sale of assets depends on consent from yard, COP and/or StatoilHydro

 key to secure delivery of units of time and cost
 "Cost of cash" is very high in today's market -- High degree if risk aversion -- Potentially interested parties may depend on expensive financing as well -- Even parties with financial capacity

 are very cautious and restrained with respect to new projects
 Bank debt - very difficult to get banks to accept pre-delivery financing in current market -- Banks provide debt against cash-flow only (i.e. 3 year contract = 3 years loan profile
