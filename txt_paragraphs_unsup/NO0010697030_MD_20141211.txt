 Secured Bond Issue 2013/2017 ("NOR06") Norwegian Energy Company ASA Senior Secured Bond Issue 2013/2016 ("NOR10")

Oslo, 11 December 2014

REINSTATING THE SITUATION TO AS IT WAS PRIOR TO DRAWING OF BONDS FOR AMORTISATION IN NOR06 AND NOR10

<<<



Reference is made to the Summons to a Bondholders' Meeting dated 4 December 2014 for a Bondholders' Meeting to take place on 18 December 2014 (the "2014 Bondholders' Meeting").

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned

<<<

 to them in the bond agreements (as amended) dated 9 December 2013 (each a "Bond Agreement" and together, the "Bond Agreements"), respectively, unless otherwise stated herein.
Background According to the Bond Agreements the Bondholders in both

<<<

 NOR06 and NOR10 were due to receive partial repayments as amortisation on 9 December 2014. A deferral of these payments has been proposed, and will be voted over in the 2014 Bondholders' Meeting. However, as a consequence of the repayments

<<<

 being due 9 December the relevant Bonds have been drawn by the Securities Depository (the "Drawing"), and the drawn Bonds has changed status to a claim on the Company ("Drawn Bonds"). These claims have no ISIN and cannot be traded within the

<<<

 ordinary settlement system. Moreover, the Drawn Bonds do not appear as Bonds on the individual Bondholders securities accounts. This situation may cause some uncertainty with regards to the individual Bondholders' ability to prove their full

<<<

 holding with respect to the voting in the 2014 Bondholders' Meeting. In order to remedy this technical challenge, the Bond Trustee and the Issuer have agreed to reinstate the situation to as it was prior to the Drawing of Bonds.

Reinstating

<<<

 the situation The only way to reinstate the situation to as it was prior to the Drawing, is to technically make a payment in kind, by way of issuing new Bonds in ratio 1:1 in consideration for the Drawn Bonds.

On 11 December 2014 new Bonds

<<<

 will be issued in the exact same amount as the number of Drawn Bonds. The new Bonds will be delivered to the Bondholders owning the Drawn Bonds, and the Drawn Bonds will be discharged.

Please note that this is done solely in order to avoid

<<<

 going forward with uncertainty of the individual Bondholders' holding of Bonds, and with the added benefit for the Bondholders to regain tradable Bonds.

Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
