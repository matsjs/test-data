<<<

2015/2020

Oslo, 5 July 2016
NOTICE OF A WRITTEN BONDHOLDERS' RESOLUTION - PROPOSAL TO SELL MV "NORSHORE ATLANTIC" (THE "VESSEL")
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above

<<<

 mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") with NSA Bondco Limited as issuer (the "Issuer").
As at the date of this resolution the total principal amount outstanding on the bonds (including PIK interest) is USD 122,679,760.
Capitalized terms used

<<<

 herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Bond Issue dated 31 August 2015 (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein.
The Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to issue this request for a written

<<<

 Bondholders' resolution pursuant to Clause 16.5 (Written Resolution) of the Bond Agreement to consider the approval of the Proposed Resolution, as further set out below.
The information in this Notice regarding the Issuer and market conditions

<<<

 is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND The Issuer entered into a bareboat charter with Norshore Management AS (the "Charterer") regarding the Vessel

<<<

 dated 31 August 2015 (the "Charterparty"), pursuant to which the Charterer is responsible for operating the Vessel. All payments made under the Charterparty were to be used to (i) pay interest on the Bonds, and (ii) either redeem the Bonds

<<<

 at the Face Value or conduct a buyback of the Bonds.
As a result of the current market situation, the Vessel is off contract and in lay-up. In a notice dated 1 April 2016, the Bondholders were informed that there are currently payment defaults

<<<

 under the Charterparty and that as a result several reservation of rights letters have been sent to the Charterer. Payments under the Charterparty have not been made since November 2015 and the payment defaults have not yet been cured. As a

<<<

 result it is likely that there will be no further payments under the Charterparty.
Due to the current situation the Issuer, with assistance from the Advisory Committee, has explored other options, including selling the Vessel, in order to be

<<<

 able to service its debt. Over recent weeks the Issuer has been in negotiation with the Charterer's shareholder, Ocean Champion Holding Limited

TO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo. Haakon Vlls gale 1. Oslo

<<<

 pursuant to Clause 10.1.5 of the Bond Agreement. Following such redemption, appropriate steps will be taken to effect an exit of the Issuer by way of either a solvent liquidation or a strike off process which will be commenced and completed

<<<

 as soon as possible. To ensure that the Issuer has sufficient funding to meet the cost of liquidation of the Issuer and its holding company Refectio, the Issuer will deduct and withhold an appropriate amount as determined by the Issuer's board

<<<

 with the approval of the Bond Trustee. Upon completion of the liquidation of the Issuer and Refectio, the residual amount will be distributed to the Bondholders with record date as at the date of redemption of the Outstanding Bonds.
2. THE

<<<

 PROPOSAL Pursuant to Clause 13.3 (e) of the Bond Agreement the Issuer may not "sell or otherwise dispose o f the Vessel". The Issuer is therefore, as recommended by the Advisoiy Committee, requesting that the Bondholders approve the Sale in

<<<

 accordance with the Conditions.
The members of the Advisory Committee have already indicated their support for the proposal as outlined below.
2.1 The Proposal In light of the above, the Issuer hereby proposes that the Bondholders adopt the

<<<

 following resolutions (the "Proposal"):
A. approve the Sale pursuant to the Conditions and asfurther described in the MOA;
B. approve the terms o f the Standstill Letter;
C. authorise and instruct the Bond Trustee to take such steps on behalf

<<<

 o f the Bondholders as may be necessary or desirable in connection with the Sale, including without limitation to (a) prepare, finalise and enter into the necessary agreements and other documentation deemed appropriate in connection with the

<<<

 Sale, (b) release the Mortgage over the Vessel, (c) release the Singaporean charge over equipment dated 31 August 2015, (d) release thefixed charge over the Vessel and the BOP contained in the Debenture, (e) release the Charterer's Assignment

<<<

 in respect o f the Charterparty, the BOP and the charter guarantee dated 31 August 2015, and (g) fo r and on behalf o f the Bondholders, take such further actions and negotiate, agree, enter into, sign and execute such agreements and documents

<<<

 that are required to complete and give effect to the Proposal;
-3 -

D. consent to the Issuer taking all necessary steps to carry out the Sale;

E. consent to the Issuer and the Bond Trustee taking all necessary steps required under the Standstill

<<<

 Letter;

F. authorises the Issuer and the Bond Trustee to provide all releases as may be necessary in connection with the Sale;

G. authorises the Issuer, in its sole discretion, to use the Deposit to pay the Transaction Costs;

H. consent

<<<

 to the Issuer discharging the remaining Outstanding Bonds (and accrued and unpaid interest) after the Sale (and liquidation o f any other assets it may have); and

I. consent to the Issuer instructing advisors to provide any services the Issuer

<<<

 may require from time to time in connection with preserving its interests, which advisors shall include (but not be limited to) Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, Advokatfirmaet Thommessen AS, Joseph and Partners, Curtis Davis Garrard LLP,

<<<

 AMA Capital Partners, Mourant Ozannes and Allen & Gledhill.

3. The Advisory Committee's evaluation Provided that the Sale is completed as contemplated, the Bondholders are expected to receive recoveries of approximately 68.7% of par value

<<<

 of the Outstanding Bonds. This figure may change depending on the level of the Transaction Costs. If completion of the Sale for some reason should not occur, the Proposal will ensure that the Issuer is not likely to be required to fund the

<<<

 lay-up costs for the Vessel during the Standstill Period by taking on super-senior financing, and, subject to the total loss provisions of Clause 27 of the MOA and/or a default occurring on the part of the Issuer, the Issuer will also be entitled

<<<

 to receive and retain the Standstill Fee and the Deposit.

4. Non reliance The Proposal is presented to the Bondholders without evaluation or recommendation from the Bond Trustee or Advisory Committee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate

<<<

 whether the Proposal is acceptable.

5. Pre-acceptance The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that Bondholders holding in excess of 80% of the Outstanding Bonds have indicated their support for the Proposal and confirmed that they will vote

<<<

 in favour o f the Proposal.

6. W ritten Bondholders' resolutions Bondholders are hereby provided with a voting request for Bondholders' written resolutions pursuant to clause 16.5 of the Bond Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting will be held.

For a vote to be valid, the Bond Trustee must have received it by mail, courier or e-mail to the address indicated in the enclosed form (the "Voting Form") no later than 14 July 2016 at 13:00 hours (Oslo time) (the 

<<<

"Voting Deadline").

Notwithstanding the Voting Deadline, and subject to the provisions of clause 16.5 of the Bond Agreement, the Proposal will become effective automatically upon receipt of affirmative votes by or on behalf of the Bondholders

<<<

 who at the date of this notice represent such majority of votes as would be required if the Proposal was voted on at a Bondholders' Meeting (which, for the avoidance of doubt is 2/3 of the Voting Bonds pursuant to clause 16.3.5 of the Bond

<<<

 Agreement) at which all Bondholders entitled to attend and vote thereat were present and voting.

4 -

-

Votes which are submitted are final and cannot be withdrawn. In the event that the Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after voting

<<<

 is conducted, the new Bondholders shall accordingly not be entitled to vote.
