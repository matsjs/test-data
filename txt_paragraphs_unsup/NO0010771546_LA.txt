<<<

 Issuer.. A Reduction of Principal will be registered in the Securities Register, and the Bond Trustee may instruct the Securities Register to split the Face Value of the Bonds in the event of a Write Down to take place. In the event that the

<<<

 Bonds have been called prior to a Write Down will take place, and the Issuer's Supervisor has given its approval to repay the remaining Outstanding Principal Amount, this may be implemented by a reduction of the Call Price, or by other ways

<<<

 which give the same intended financial results. The Bond Trustee may instruct the Securities Register to split the Face Value o f the Bonds.

 Event; (e) will not result in the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Bonds being greater than

<<<

 reinstated to the Initial Amount. Any decision by the Issuer to effect or not to effect any Discretionary Reinstatement on any occasion shall not preclude it from effecting or not effecting any Discretionary Reinstatement on any other occasion

<<<

3.7.11 For the avoidance of doubt, Discretionary Reinstatement shall apply to the Bonds only if, and to the extent that, the Bonds have been Written Down following the occurrence of a Trigger Event in accordance with the provisions of Clause

<<<

 3.7.2 above. If at any time the Bonds are Written Down pursuant to Chapter 21 sub-chapter I of the Financial Undertakings Act, the principal amount by which the Bonds are so written down pursuant to the Financial Undertakings Act shall not

<<<
