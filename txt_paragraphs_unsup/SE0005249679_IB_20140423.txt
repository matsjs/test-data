A. Request
Background
About the transaction and its implication for the Noteholders
The owners of the Issuer have entered into an agreement for the sale of the Issuer to a company within the Avincis

<<<

 Group and whereby the Issuer will receive a strong industrial owner. The sale and purchase of the Issuer is subject to certain conditions precedent (including regulatory approvals). Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent a Change of

<<<

 Control Event will occur under the Terms and Conditions of the Notes and each Noteholder would have the right to request that all or some of its Notes be repurchased in accordance with Clause 9.5.1 of the Terms and Conditions. Clause 9.5.1

<<<

 reads as follows:
" Upon a Change o f Control Event occurring, each Noteholder shall have the right to request that all, o r some only, o f its Notes be repurchased at a price p er Note equal to 101 p er cent, o f the Nominal Amount together

<<<

 with accrued but unpaid Interest, during a period o f twenty (20) Business Days following a notice from the Issuer o f the Change o f Control Event pursuant to Clause 10.1.2 (after which time period such right shall lapse). However, such period

<<<

 may not start earlier than upon the occurrence o f the Change o f Control Event."
The Issuer therefore proposes that the described sale and purchase of the Issuer be exempted from the application of Clause 9.5.1. so that the Issuer not will

<<<

 be required to repurchase Notes under Clause 9.5.1 as a result of the sale and purchase. The request is set out below.
Postponement o f admission to trading o f Notes
In connection with the abovementioned transaction the Issuer will also need

<<<

 to adapt its accounting to the principles used by the Avincis Group. In order to make the transition by the Issuer to IFRS in conjunction with the principles used by the Avincis Group and since IFRS is a requirement for the admission to trading

<<<

 of the Notes on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, the Issuer wishes to postpone the requirement to apply for the admission of trading of the Notes until after the sale of the Issuer to the Avincis Group has closed.
Under Clause 11.3.1, the Issuer shall

<<<

 use its best efforts to ensure that the loan evidenced by the Notes is admitted to trading on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm no later than 360 days after the First Issue Date and that it remains admitted or, if such admission to trading is not possible

<<<

 to obtain or maintain, admitted to trading on another Regulated Market.
In the event that the Notes are not admitted to trading within the prescribed time, each Noteholder would have the right to request that all or some of its Notes be repurchased

<<<

 in accordance with Clause 9.5.2 of the Terms and Conditions. Clause 9.5.2 reads as follows:
'"If (i) the Notes are not admitted to trading on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm within 12 months from the First Issue Date o r (ii) the Notes are no longer admitted

<<<

 to trading on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm without being admitted to trading on another Regulated Market within the EEA, each Noteholder shall have the right to request that all, or some only, o f its Notes be repurchased at a price p e r Note equal

<<<

 to 101 p er cent, o f the Nomina!Am ount together with accrued but unpaid Interest, during a period o f

CorpNordic

twenty (20) Business Days following a notice from the Issuer o f any event referred to in (i) o r (ii) above pursuant to Clause

<<<

 10.1.2 (after which time period such right shall lapse). However, such period may not start earlier than upon the occurrence o f any o f the events referred to in (i) or (ii) above."
Further to the described sale of the Issuer, the Issuer proposes

<<<

 that the prescribed time periods for admission to trading of the Notes be extended so that (a) the time period in Clause 11.3.1 be extended and (b) the Issuer will not be required to repurchase Notes under Clause 9.5.2 as a result of the Notes

<<<

 not being admitted to trading on a Regulated Market within 12 months from the First Issue Date. The request is set out below.
