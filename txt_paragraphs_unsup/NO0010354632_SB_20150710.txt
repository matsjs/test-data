BACKGROUND

<<<


The Maturity Date of the Bonds is currently 14 July 2015. In order to facilitate repayment and/or refinancing of the Bonds, the Company believes that it would be helpful to have clarity on the future deployment of the Group's two vessels.
In

<<<

 the case of Crystal Ocean, an extension to the period of her contract for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico has now been agreed with the charterers of the vessel for a period of three years at a day rate of US$40,000/day, subject to satisfaction

<<<

 of certain conditions precedent. The charterers of the vessel are currently in discussions with Pemex regarding an extension of their own existing arrangements for the vessel, which will affect the satisfaction of the aforementioned conditions

<<<

 precedent.
In the case of Front Puffin, the vessel is currently in the yard in Singapore undergoing works in preparation for being deployed to Nigeria, with an estimated arrival date by year-end.
In light of the above, and in order to allow

<<<

 the Company to have certainty on the deployment of Crystal Ocean before determining a solution for repayment of the Bonds, the
