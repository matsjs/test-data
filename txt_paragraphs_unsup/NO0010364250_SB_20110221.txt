Background

W'

N O R SK TILL ITSM A N N ASA www.rnisiec.no

On 10 December 2010 the Bondholders approved a restructuring of the

<<<

 2007/2012 Loan and

the 2009/2010 Loan at a Bondholders' meeting in respect of each o f the Loans, on the basis of

a term sheet approved by the board of directors of Cecon on 13 October 2010 (the "Original

Term Sheet"). One of the conditions

<<<

 for the restructuring was a satisfactory waiver by Export

Development Canada ("EDC") of existing defaults under the first priority loan. EDC,

however, was not willing to give a waiver and would only agree to a standstill in respect of

existing

<<<

 defaults until 31 March 2011 (subject to certain conditions and early termination

provisions), thus requiring adjustments to the Original Term Sheet. The Original Term Sheet

was amended in agreement with a majority of the Bondholders and

<<<

 a majority of the

shareholders of Cecon ASA, and approved by the board of Cecon on 31 January 2011 (the

"Term Sheet"). The Term Sheet is attached hereto as Appendix 1. The Bondholders are

summoned to Bondholders' meetings for the Loans on

<<<

 2 March 2011 for the purpose of

approving the Term Sheet and all ancillary actions and resolutions thereof as further described

below.

Overview of the Restructuring On the basis of the Term Sheet, Cecon (and its subsidiaries Cecon 1 and

<<<

 Cecon 2) are currently seeking to undergo a. restructuring process (the "Restructuring") whereby (i) the Loans will be restructured by reducing the principal amounts of the Loans in exchange for an issuance of shares to the Bondholders, (ii

<<<

) certain of the economic and other terms of the Loans will be amended, and (iii) a new loan will be made to Cecon in the amount of USD 5-7 million with warrants attached.

The Term Sheet will in brief have the following effects on the Bondholders

<<<

 and the Loans:

i Cecon will issue a new loan of between USD 5 and 7 million, whereof USD 3 million has been pre-committed and pre allocated to Riulf Rustad and certain companies controlled or associated with him (which may include Zoncolan

<<<

 ASA and Ousdal AS) and minimum USD 2 million and maximum USD 4 million will be allocated to existing Bondholders as further described below under "Participation in the New Loan" and in the Term Sheet (the "New Loan"). The New Loan will be issued

<<<

 as a new tranche under the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement (as amended in the Restructuring), rank senior to the bonds remaining under the 2007/2012 Loan and the 2009/2010 Loan after the Restructuring, have a term of two years and collect 5% interest

<<<

. The subscribers to the New Loan shall be entitled to receive a total of 65 million warrants, each of which will entitle the holder to subscribe for one share in Cecon, subject to adjustment as described in the Term Sheet (the "Warrants").

<<<



ii As described in the Term Sheet, the Bondholders who choose to participate in the New Loan will have all or a portion of their bonds in the remaining Loans elevated so that they rank junior to the New Loan but senior to the rest of the remaining

<<<

 Loans.

iii The Warrants will be issued to subscribers under the New Loan pro rata to the allocation of the New Loan in accordance with the allocation principles described below and in the Term Sheet.

iv The 2009/2010 Loan will be partially

<<<

 cancelled, together with all of the accrued, unpaid interest on the 2009/2010 Loan since 30 April 2010, against issuance of against issuance of 5,500,000 shares by Cecon to the 2009 Bondholders and holders of unpaid coupons (as the case may

<<<

 be). Following the cancellation, USD 8,125,000 o f the 2009/2010 Loan will remain and will be exchanged for bonds under the 2007/2012 Loan governed by the

2007/2012 Loan AgreemOTt as ^f^^4S o^?fM ^W e¥truc^iring. The borrowers under the 

<<<

2007/2012 Loan are Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 and the transactions accordingly involve a change of borrower for the 2009/2010 Loan.
v The 2007/2012 Loan will be partially cancelled, together with all of the accrued, unpaid interest on the 2007/201

<<<

2 Loan since 5 November 2009, against issuance of 44,000,000 shares by Cecon to the 2007 Bondholders and holders of unpaid coupons (as the case may be). Following the cancellation, USD 65,000,000 of the 2007/2012 Loan will remain under the 

<<<

2007/2012 Loan governed by the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement as amended under the Restructuring.
vi Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 will enter into a fee agreement (the "Restructuring Fee Agreement") with Ousdal AS regarding a fee (the "Restructuring Fee") to

<<<

 be paid by Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 to Oustad AS for services provided by Mr. Riulf Rustad regarding the facilitation, negotiation and implementation of the Restructuring. Mr. Riulf Rustad is also the chairman of Cecon. The Restructuring Fee consists

<<<

 of USD 1,000,000 "Tranche C2 Bonds" (as defined in the Term Sheet). Under the Restructuring Fee Agreement Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 will remunerate Ousdal AS in full for services that have also benefited Cecon. It is pointed out that Cecon, under

<<<

 the Term Sheet, will guarantee the Subsidiaries' obligations under the "Tranche C2 Bonds".
vii Cecon, Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 will enter into a settlement and recourse agreement (the "Settlement and Recourse Agreement") regarding certain intra

<<<

-group arrangements. The Settlement and Recourse Agreement provides for 1/3 of the Restructuring Fee to be allocated to each of Cecon, Cecon 1 and Cecon 2. Cecon will owe to Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 any part of the Restructuring Fee settled by the

<<<

 Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 on behalf of Cecon.
Participation in the New Loan On the condition that the Bondholders approve the Restructuring and the Term Sheet the subscription period for the New Loan with Warrants is expected to be from 28 February

<<<

 until 4 March 2011 at 14:00 hours CET. Subscription forms will be sent to Bondholders and published on the Company's web-site on www.cecon.no on Monday 28 February and be conditional upon required shareholders' and Bondholders' approval of

<<<

 the restructuring. Allocation of the New Loan and Warrants will be determined by the Company shortly after the end of the subscription period. To be eligible to purchase bonds in the New Loan, Bondholders must subscribe for bonds in a principal

<<<

 amount not less than the USD equivalent of 650,000 (the "Minimum Subscription Amount"), but:
· the Company may allocate to any Bondholder bonds in the New Loan in a principal amount less than the amount subscribed for by that Bondholder; and

<<<


· to the extent possible without breaching the prospectus rules of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act Chapter 7, the Company intends to allocate the portion of the New Loan that is available to Bondholders among participating Bondholders

<<<

 on a strict pro rata basis.
If, for any reason, the Company is unable to allocate the New Loan in this manner without breaching the prospectus rules of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act Chapter 7, the Company may, in consultation with the

<<<

 Loan Trustee, adopt alternative allocation principles which may include:

' NORSIC T IL L IT SM A N N ASA www.tn.istcc.no
® if a Bondholder's pro rata share of the New Loan would be less than the Minimum Subscription Amount, rounding the principal

<<<

 amount of the bonds in the New Loan allocated to that Bondholder to zero or the Minimum Subscription Amount (whichever is closer to that Bondholder's pro rata share of the New Loan);
· disregarding subscriptions below 50,000; or
® preparing

<<<

 and distributing a prospectus designed to comply with the prospectus rules of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act Chapter 7.
Ongoing processes Cecon has called an extraordinary shareholders meeting on 28 February 2011 for the purpose of approval

<<<

 of the Term Sheet and the Settlement and Recourse Agreement under §3-8 of the Joint Stock Public Companies Act, issue of the Warrants and increase of the share capital by issuance of 49,500,000 new shares for the purpose of partial settlement

<<<

 of the Loans as set out in the Term Sheet. It is a condition to the Restructuring that the shareholders of Cecon resolve to issue the new shares and the Warrants, as well as approve the term sheet and the agreements presented to the shareholders

<<<

, as per the further details of the notice of the shareholders meeting dated 7 February 2011 and published on the company's web-site www.cecon.no.
To enable Cecon to conduct the Restructuring as described in the Term Sheet, Cecon has requested

<<<

 the Loan Trustee to summon Bondholders' meetings in respect of each of the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement and the 2009/2010 Loan Agreement to consider the approval of the conditions for the Restructuring and the Term Sheet.
Trustee's disclaimer/non
