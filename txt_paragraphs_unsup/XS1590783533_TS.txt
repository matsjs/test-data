Application has been made to the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the "CSSF")

<<<

 in its capacity as competent authority under the Luxembourg Act dated 10 July 2005 on prospectuses for securities (the "Prospectus Act 2005") to approve this document as a prospectus. The CSSF assumes no responsibility for the economic and

<<<

 financial soundness of the transactions contemplated by this prospectus or the quality or solvency of the Issuer in accordance with Article 7(7) of the Prospectus Act 2005. Application has also been made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for

<<<

 the Capital Securities to be admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market and to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. References in this Prospectus to Capital Securities being "listed"

<<<

 (and all related references) shall mean that such Capital Securities have been admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market and have been admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Luxembourg

<<<

 Stock Exchange's regulated market is a regulated market for the purposes of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ("Directive 2004/39/EC").
The Capital Securities have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities

<<<

 Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Securities Act"), and are subject to United States tax law requirements. The Capital Securities are being offered outside the United States by the Joint Bookrunners (as defined in the section entitled "Subscription

<<<

 and Sale") in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act ("Regulation S"), and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from

<<<

, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements o f the Securities Act.
PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - The Capital Securities are not intended from 1 January 2018, to be offered, sold or otherwise made available

<<<

 to and, with effect from such date, should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail

<<<

 client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU ("MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article

<<<

 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the "Prospectus Directive"). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the PRIIPs Regulation) for offering

<<<

 or selling the Capital Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Capital Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the

<<<

 EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Capital Securities are expected to be rated "Baa3" by Moody's Investors Service Limited ("Moody's") and "BBB" (negative watch) by Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services Europe Limited

<<<

 will be issued in bearer form and initially represented by global capital securities which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (each as defined herein). See "Summary

SUITABILITY

<<<

 OF INVESTMENT
The Capital Securities are complex financial instruments and may not be a suitable investment for all investors. Each potential investor in the Capital Securities must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its

<<<

 own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor may wish to consider, either on its own or with the help of its financial and other professional advisers, whether it:
(i) has sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful

<<<

 evaluation of the Capital Securities, the merits and risks of investing in the Capital Securities and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;
11

(ii) has access to, and knowledge

<<<

 of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Capital Securities and the impact the Capital Securities will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) has sufficient

<<<

 financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Capital Securities, including Capital Securities where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency;


<<<

(iv) understands thoroughly the terms of the Capital Securities and is familiar with the behaviour of financial markets; and
(v) is able to evaluate possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment

<<<

 and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Capital Securities. Legal investment considerations may restrict

<<<

 certain investments. The investment activities of certain investors are subject to investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether

<<<

 and to what extent (1) Capital Securities are legal investments for it, (2) Capital Securities can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Capital Securities. Financial

<<<

 institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Capital Securities under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

Risk Factors
In purchasing Capital Securities, investors assume the risk that the Issuer may become insolvent or otherwise be unable to make all payments

<<<

 due in respect of the Capital Securities. There is a wide range of factors which individually or together could result in the Issuer becoming unable to make all payments due. It is not possible to identify all such factors or to determine which

<<<

 factors are most likely to occur, as the Issuer may not be aware o f all relevant factors and certain factors which it currently deems not to be material may become material as a result o f the occurrence o f events outside the Issuer's control

<<<

. The Issuer has identified in this Prospectus a number o ffactors which could materially adversely affect its business and ability to make payments due.
In addition, factors which are material fo r the purpose o f assessing the market risks

<<<

 associated with the Capital Securities are also described below.
Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision..
Factors

<<<

 that may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Capital Securities
Telia Company operates in a broad range of geographical product and service markets in the highly competitive and regulated telecommunications industry

<<<

. As a result, Telia Company is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Telia Company has defined risk as anything that could have a material adverse effect on the achievement of Telia Company's goals. Risks can be threats, uncertainties

<<<

 or lost opportunities relating to Telia Company's current or future operations or activities. Set forth below is a description of some of the factors that may affect its business, brand perception, financial position and results of operations

<<<

.
Industry and market conditions
Globalfinancial markets unrest
Changes in the global financial markets are difficult to predict. Telia Company strives to have a strong balance sheet and operates in a relatively non-cyclical or late-cyclical

<<<

 industry. However, a severe or long term financial crisis by itself or by triggering of a downturn in the economy of one or more countries in which Telia Company operates would have an impact on customers and may have a negative impact on growth

<<<

 and results of operations through reduced telecom spending.
The maturity schedule of Telia Company's loan portfolio is aimed to be evenly distributed over several years, and refinancing is expected to be made by using uncommitted open-market

<<<

 debt financing programmes and bank loans, alongside the company's free cash flow. In addition, Telia Company has committed bank credit lines that are deemed to be sufficient and may be utilised if the open-market refinancing conditions are

<<<

 poor. However, Telia Company's cost of funding might be higher should there be unfavourable changes in the global financial markets.
International political and macroeconomic developments
Telia Company has material investments in the Russian

<<<

 Federation related to its associated company PAO MegaFon and the international carrier operations. Following the conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, the European Union and the United States have implemented sanctions directed

<<<

 towards individuals and corporates. The Russian Federation has as a consequence decided on certain counter actions. The sanctions and counter actions may negatively affect the Russian rouble and the Russian economy, which in turn may impact

<<<

 countries whose economies are closely linked to the Russian economy, such as a number of Telia Company's Eurasian operations. These developments, as well as other international political conflicts or
1

developments affecting countries in

<<<

 which Telia Company is operating, may adversely impact Telia Company's cash flows, financial position and results of operations.
Competition andprice pressure
Telia Company is subject to substantial and historically increasing competition and

<<<

 price pressure. Competition from a variety of sources, including current market participants, new entrants and new products and services, may adversely affect Telia Company's results of operations. Competition has from time to time led to increasing

<<<

 customer churn, decreasing customer bases and to declines in the prices Telia Company charges for its products and services, and may have similar effects in the future.
Transition to new business models in the telecom industry may lead to structural

<<<

 changes and different competitive dynamics. Failure to anticipate and respond to industry dynamics, and to drive a change agenda to meet mature and developing demands in the marketplace, may affect Telia Company's customer relationships, service

<<<

 offerings and position in the value chain, and adversely impact its results of operations.
Regulation
Telia Company operates in a highly regulated industry. The regulations to which Telia Company is subject impose significant limits on its

<<<

 flexibility to manage its business. In a number of countries, Telia Company entities have been designated as a party with significant market power in one or several telecom submarkets. As a result, Telia Company is required to provide certain

<<<

 services on regulated terms and prices, which may differ from the terms on which it would otherwise have provided those services. Effects from regulatory intervention may be both retroactive and prospective.
Changes in regulation or government

<<<

 policy affecting Telia Company's business activities, as well as decisions by regulatory authorities or courts, including granting, amending or revoking of telecom licences and frequency permits for Telia Company or other parties, could adversely

<<<

 affect Telia Company's business and results of operations.
Emerging markets
Telia Company has made significant investments in telecom operators in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Moldova, Nepal, Russia, Turkey and Afghanistan

<<<

. Historically, the political, economic, legal and regulatory systems in these countries have been less predictable than in countries with more mature institutional structures. The political situation in each of the emerging market countries

<<<

 may remain or become increasingly unpredictable, and markets in which Telia Company operates may become unstable, even to the extent that Telia Company decides or will be forced to exit a country or a specific operation within a country. Another

<<<

 implication may be unexpected or unpredictable litigation cases under civil or tax legislation.
Other risks associated with operating in emerging market countries include foreign exchange restrictions or administrative issues, which could effectively

<<<

 prevent Telia Company from repatriating cash, e.g. by receiving dividends and repayment of loans, or from selling its investments.
Still another risk is the potential establishment of foreign ownership restrictions or other possible actions

<<<

 against entities with foreign ownership, either formally or informally.
Such negative political or legal developments or weakening of the economies or currencies in these markets might have a significantly negative effect on Telia Company's

<<<

 results of operations and financial position.
2

In September 2015, Telia Company announced its decision to reduce its presence in region Eurasia (Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Moldova and Nepal) and, over time,

<<<

 to leave the region completely. Sales processes are ongoing and the divestment of Ncell in Nepal was completed on 11 April 2016. The nature of these markets, including potential government intervention and other factors mentioned above, combined

<<<

 with the fact that assets are not fully-owned and there are undertakings and obligations under various shareholder agreements, as well as reputational issues regarding the assets and fewer potential buyers than in more mature markets, makes

<<<

 the complexity of these sales processes high with significant uncertainties regarding both expected outcome and timing.
Operations and strategic activities
Impairment losses and restructuring charges
Factors generally affecting the telecom

<<<

 markets as well as changes in the economic, regulatory, business or political environment impact Telia Company financially. Management also constantly reviews and refines its business plans, and may make exit decisions or take other actions

<<<

 in order to effectively execute Telia Company's strategy. Should such circumstances negatively change management's expectation of future cash flows attributable to certain assets, Telia Company will be required to recognise asset impairment

<<<

 losses, including but not limited to goodwill and fair value adjustments recorded in connection with historical or future acquisitions.
Telia Company has undertaken a number of restructuring and streamlining initiatives, mainly affecting the

<<<

 Nordic operations, which have resulted in substantial restructuring and streamlining charges. Similar initiatives may be undertaken in the future.
Telia Company also has significant deferred tax assets resulting from earlier recorded impairment

<<<

 losses and restructuring charges. Significant adverse changes in the economic, regulatory, business or political environment, as well as in Telia Company's business plans, could also result in Telia Company not being able to use these tax assets

<<<

 in full to reduce its tax obligations in the future, and would consequently lead to an additional tax charge when such tax asset is derecognised.
In addition to affecting Telia Company's financial position and results of operations, such impairment

<<<

 losses and restructuring charges may adversely affect Telia Company's ability to pay dividends.
Investments in business transformation, new technology and future growth
Telia Company is currently investing in business transformation and future

<<<

 growth through, for example, initiatives to increase competitiveness and reduce cost as well as to improve capacity and access. Telia Company is also constantly investing in sales and marketing efforts to retain and acquire customers in its

<<<

 markets. Further, Telia Company normally has to pay fees to acquire new telecom licenses and frequency permits or to renew or maintain existing ones. In order to attract new customers, Telia Company has previously also engaged in start-up operations

<<<

 and may decide to do so also in the future, which would require additional investments and expenditure in the build-up phase.
Telia Company believes that these investments and initiatives will improve market position and financial strength

<<<

. However, success will depend on a variety of factors beyond Telia Company's control, including the cost of acquiring, renewing or maintaining telecom licenses and frequency permits, the cost of new technology, availability of new and attractive

<<<

 services, the costs associated with providing these services, the timing of their introduction, the market demand and prices for such services, and competition. Should Telia Company fail to reach the targets set for its business transformation

<<<

 and customer attraction activities, the results of operations will be negatively impacted.
3

Business combinations and strategic alliances
Telia Company is constantly reviewing its asset portfolio in line with the strategy of increasing ownership

<<<

 in core holdings. Over the years, Telia Company has made a number of targeted acquisitions in accordance with its strategy. Telia Company may continue to expand and grow its business through business combinations, strategic alliances, etc.

<<<

 The efficient integration of these acquisitions and the realisation of related cost and revenue synergies, as well as the positive development of the acquired operations, are significant for the results of operations both in the long and short

<<<

 term. If Telia Company fails to integrate or manage any acquired company or strategic alliance, there is a risk that management's attention would be diverted away from other business concerns. In addition, any potential acquisition could negatively

<<<

 affect Telia Company's financial position and its credit ratings or, if made using Telia Company shares, dilute the existing shareholders.
Shareholder matters in partly owned subsidiaries
Telia Company conducts some of its activities, particularly

<<<

 outside of the Nordic region, through subsidiaries in which Telia Company does not have 100 per cent. ownership. Under the governing documents for certain of these entities, the holders of non-controlling interests have protective rights in

<<<

 matters such as approval of dividends, changes in the ownership structure and other shareholder-related matters. As a result, actions outside Telia Company's control and adverse to its interests may affect Telia Company's position to act as

<<<

 planned in these partly owned subsidiaries.
Customer service and network quality
In addition to cost efficiency in all operations, Telia Company focuses on high-quality service to its customers and high-quality networks. Telia Company's ambition

<<<

 to create a service company on the customers' terms requires a major internal change of processes, attitude and focus in many parts of the company. Externally, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters may cause serious problems to network

<<<

 quality and availability and need to be considered in the business continuity planning. High-quality networks and services are fundamental to the customer perception of Telia Company and its success going forward. Whatever the reason, failure

<<<

 to reach or maintain high-quality levels would have an adverse impact on Telia Company's business.
Supply chain
Telia Company is reliant upon a limited number of suppliers to manufacture and supply network equipment and related software as

<<<

 well as terminals, to allow Telia Company to develop its networks and to offer its services on a commercial basis. In addition, like its competitors, Telia Company currently outsources many of its key support services, including network construction

<<<

 and maintenance, in most of its operations. The limited number of suppliers of these services, and the terms of Telia Company's arrangements with current and future suppliers, may adversely affect Telia Company, including by restricting its

<<<

 operational flexibility.
Ability to recruit and retain skilledpersonnel
To remain competitive and implement its strategy, and to adapt to changing technologies, Telia Company will need to recruit, retain, and where necessary retrain highly

<<<

 skilled employees with particular expertise. In particular, competition is intense for qualified telecommunications and information technology personnel. To a considerable extent, Telia Company's ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel

<<<

 for growth business areas and new technologies will depend on its ability to offer competitive remuneration packages. In some of the countries in which Telia Company operates, regulations related to granting work permits for foreign citizens

<<<

 represent a complicating factor due to often bureaucratic and time-consuming procedures. If Telia
4

Company fails to recruit or retrain necessary highly skilled employees, its ability to develop high growth business areas and new business

<<<

 areas or remain competitive in the traditional business areas may be limited.
Associated companies and joint operations
Limited influence in associated companies andjoint operations
Telia Company conducts some of its activities, particularly

<<<

 outside of the Nordic region, through associated companies. Examples of major associated companies are PAO MegaFon in Russia and Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S. in Turkey. In turn, these associated companies own stakes in numerous other companies

<<<

. Telia Company does not have a controlling interest in its associated companies and as a result has limited influence over the conduct of all these businesses.
Under the governing documents for certain of these entities, Telia Company's partners

<<<

 have control over or share control of key matters such as the approval of business plans and budgets, and decisions as to the timing and amount of cash distributions. The risk of actions outside Telia Company's or its associated companies'

<<<

 control and adverse to Telia Company's interests, or disagreement or deadlock, is inherent in associated companies and jointly controlled entities. One example of this is the ongoing corporate governance issues at shareholder level in Turkcell

<<<

. Further, Telia Company might not be able to ensure that the associated companies apply the same sustainability principles, increasing the risk for wrongdoings and reputational and financial losses. Telia Company strives to use its board presence

<<<

 and active ownership practices to promote the implementation of its sustainability principles.
Variations in the financial performance of these associated companies have an impact on Telia Company's results of operations also in the short term

.
As part of its strategy, Telia Company may increase its shareholdings in some of its associated companies. The implementation of such strategy, however, may be difficult due to a variety of factors, including factors beyond Telia Company's

<<<

 control, such as willingness on the part of other existing shareholders to dispose or accept dilution of their shareholdings and, in the event Telia Company gains greater control, its ability to successfully manage the relevant businesses.

<<<


In Sweden, Telia Company has entered into a cooperation arrangement with Tele2 to build and operate a UMTS network through a 50 per cent. owned joint operation, Svenska UMTS-nat AB, which has rights to a Swedish UMTS licence. In Denmark, Telia

<<<

 Company has entered into a similar agreement with Telenor to build and operate a common radio access network through a 50 per cent. owned joint operation, TTNetvsrket P/S. Telia Company has made significant financial investments in these operations

<<<

. As they are jointly controlled, there is a risk that the partners may disagree on important matters, including funding of the operations. This risk may be magnified because Telia Company and Tele2 and Telenor, respectively, are significant

<<<

 competitors. A disagreement or deadlock regarding these operations or a breach by one of the parties of the material provisions of the cooperation arrangements could have a negative effect on Telia Company.
Sustainability
Human rights - freedom

<<<

 o f expression
Issues related to human rights pose high risks to the telecom industry. Risks include complicity in human rights violations by operators being linked to excessive governmental demands to the detriment of privacy and freedom of

<<<

 expression and by telecom services being used for the sexual exploitation of children. International standards on human rights go beyond identifying and managing material risks to Telia Company, they also relate to the risks to individuals

<<<

.
5

National laws and regulations on surveillance of communications or the shut-down of networks could be defined in ways that enable violations of human rights. Government monitoring, blocking or take-down requests often serve a legitimate

<<<

 purpose, including to protect human rights. However, there are major and problematic government requests that might conflict with freedom of expression and privacy. Telia Company may be legally required to comply with such requests and, like

<<<

 other telecom operators, only have limited leverage with which to investigate, challenge or reject the requests. In some countries, this dilemma places Telia Company at heightened risks of being linked to severe human rights abuses. These risks

<<<

 are further strengthened in relationships with state entities and the fact that major requests often are strictly confidential.
Customer privacy
Vast amounts of data are generated when customers use Telia Company's services and networks. New

<<<

 ways of connecting and data-heavy business models make it difficult for individuals to understand and retain control over how their data is collected and used. Moreover, it is challenging to establish and uphold "bulletproof" privacy protection

<<<

 in increasingly sophisticated data environments and in ever-changing technical and risk landscapes. While Telia Company, through appropriate measures, avoids failure in its work to protect the privacy of its customers and to secure network

<<<

 integrity as well as data security, external or internal factors may negatively impact data security and privacy and cause unfavourable effects on customers' perception of how Telia Company handles these matters, potentially leading to an adverse

<<<

 impact on Telia Company's business and results of operations.
Corruption and unethical business practices
Some of the countries in which Telia Company operates are ranked as having high levels of corruption according to sources such as Transparency

<<<

 International, Business Against Corruption and the World Bank. The telecom industry is particularly exposed to bribery and corruption risks due to the dependency on government-granted telecom licenses and frequency permits, as well as the need

<<<

 for government-granted permits and approvals at several stages of the network roll-out process. In addition, there may be requests for, by way of example, free services and numbers as well as sponsorships and donations to facilitate operational

<<<

 processes. Actual or perceived corruption or unethical business practices may damage customers' or other stakeholders' perception of Telia Company and also result in financial penalties and debarment from procurement processes. A serious negative

<<<

 impact on Telia Company's business operations and its brand might lead to a decision to exit one or a number of markets. Further, after making such a decision, the divestment process as such may expose Telia Company to the risk of corruption

<<<

 and unethical business behaviour.
Review o f Eurasian transactions
In late 2012, the then Board of Directors appointed the Swedish law firm Mannheimer Swartling ("MSA") to investigate allegations of corruption related to Telia Company's investments

<<<

 in Uzbekistan. MSA's report was made public on 1 February 2013.
In April 2013, the Board of Directors appointed the international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright ("NRF") to review transactions and agreements made in Eurasia by Telia Company

<<<

 in previous years with the intention of giving the Board a clear picture of the transactions and a risk assessment from a business ethics perspective. For advice on implications under Swedish legislation, the Board appointed two Swedish law

<<<

 firms. In consultation with the law firms, Telia Company has promptly taken steps, and will continue to take steps, in its business operations as well as in its governance structure and with its personnel which reflect concerns arising from

<<<

 the review. The Swedish Prosecution Authority's investigation with respect to Uzbekistan is ongoing and Telia Company continues to cooperate with and provide assistance to the Prosecutor.
6

If continued assessments and investigations lead

<<<

 to new observations and findings, the possibility cannot be excluded that the consequences of such findings would be that the results of operations and financial position in Telia Company's operations in the Eurasian jurisdictions are adversely

<<<

 impacted.
Another risk is presented by the Swedish Prosecution Authority's notification at the beginning of 2013, during the investigation of Telia Company's transactions in Uzbekistan, that it is separately investigating the possibility of

<<<

 seeking a corporate fine against Telia Company, which, under the Swedish Criminal Act, could be up to a maximum amount of SEK 10 million, and forfeiture of any proceeds to Telia Company resulting from the alleged crimes. The Swedish Prosecution

<<<

 Authority may take similar actions with respect to transactions made or agreements entered into by Telia Company relating to operations in its other Eurasian markets.
Further, actions taken, or to be taken, by the police, prosecution or regulatory

<<<

 authorities in other jurisdictions against Telia Company's operations or transactions, or against third parties, whether they be Swedish or nonSwedish individuals or legal entities, might directly or indirectly harm Telia Company's business

<<<

, results of operations, financial position, cash flows or brand reputation. For example, investigations concerning bribery and money laundering in connection with the transactions in Uzbekistan are being conducted by the Dutch prosecutor and

<<<

 police authorities, and by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As requested by the Dutch authorities, Telia Company has provided a bank guarantee of EUR 10 million as collateral for any financial

<<<

 claims which may be decided against one of its Dutch subsidiaries. Telia Company is cooperating fully with the Dutch and U.S. authorities. The investigations were initiated in March 2014 and are still ongoing. At this point in time, it is not

<<<

 possible to assess how or when the investigations will be resolved. On 14 September 2016, Telia Company received a proposal from the US and the Dutch authorities for financial sanctions amounting to a total of approximately USD 1.45 billion

<<<

. Resolution of the various investigations is complex and will require further discussion and negotiation with the various government agencies involved in the investigations. There is currently no certainly as to the timing and amount that may

<<<

 be paid at the time of a final resolution and there is a risk that the investigations will result in further forms of sanctions, monetary and/or otherwise. The outcome of the investigations may have a material adverse effect on Telia Company

<<<

's financials.
Telia Company has received requests to make public the reviews made by NRF and other law firms. However, despite risking criticism, it is not possible to publish the reviews because they relate to individuals, companies and business

<<<

 agreements which are private. Telia Company would risk incurring lawsuits if it were to publish the relevant reports as the law firms' views are not necessarily shared by those implicated. As already stated, Telia Company continuously hands

<<<

 over information to law enforcement agencies, who are better equipped to assess whether any criminal acts have occurred.
Responsible Procurement
Telia Company needs to ensure that its policies on ethical business practices, environmental issues

<<<

, human rights and labour laws are all fully respected by its suppliers and their sub-suppliers. Failure or perception of failure of Telia Company's suppliers to adhere to these requirements may damage the customers' or other stakeholders' perception

<<<

 of Telia Company and negatively impact Telia Company's business operations and its brand.
Environment and climate change
Telia Company expects increasing regulation and taxation of fossil fuel usage, greenhouse gas emissions and electronic

<<<

 waste. Energy shortages and increasing energy costs may incur additional costs or lost revenues for Telia Company.
7

As a consequence of climate change, extreme weather conditions such as storms, heavy rainfalls and floods will be more common

<<<

 and may prevent Telia Company from keeping its networks running, negatively affecting its results of operations.
Occupational health and safety
Serious risks related to occupational health and safety ("OHS") are generally linked to construction

<<<

 and maintenance work. Such work is mainly carried out by contractors, but Telia Company must ensure that these suppliers have proper OHS practices, as accidents or malpractice might damage Telia Company's operations and/or reputation. Most

<<<

 Telia Company employees work in office or store environments, where the main risks are psychosocial wellbeing and ergonomics. If not managed properly, these risks may lead to increasing sick leave and a higher number of accidents and injuries

<<<

, potentially incurring significant costs.
Actions by the largest shareholder
As of the date of this Prospectus, the Swedish State held 37.3 per cent. of Telia Company's outstanding shares. Accordingly, the Swedish State, acting alone, may have

<<<

 the power to influence any matters submitted for a vote of shareholders. The interest of the Swedish State in deciding these matters could be different from the interests of Telia Company's other shareholders.
Financial risk management
Telia

<<<

 Company is exposed to financial risks such as credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, financing risk and pension obligation risk. Financial risk management is centralised in the Group Treasury unit. Failure to effectively

<<<

 manage and hedge these financial risks could have a negative impact on Telia Company's financial position and results of operations.
Credit risk
The credit risk with respect to Telia Company's trade receivables is diversified geographically

<<<

 and among a large number of customers, both private individuals and companies in various industries. Bad debt expense in relation to consolidated net sales was 0.5 per cent. in 2016 (0.6 per cent. in 2015).
Liquidity risk
Telia Company manages

<<<

 the liquidity risk by depositing its surplus liquidity in banks or investing it in short term interest-bearing instruments with good credit ratings. In addition to available cash, Telia Company has committed revolving credit facilities and

<<<

 overdraft facilities. In total, the available unutilised amount under committed facilities was approximately SEK 16 billion at year end 2016.
Currency risk
Telia Company's operational currency transaction exposure is not significant. Telia

<<<

 Company's conversion exposure, however, is significant. Telia Company does not normally hedge its conversion exposure. At yearend 2016, the conversion exposure amounted to SEK 69.9 billion (SEK 60.5 billion at year end 2015). Weakening of the

<<<

 Swedish Krona by ten percentage points against all currencies in which Telia Company has conversion exposure would have had a positive impact of SEK 7 billion on the group's equity as of 31 December 2016.
8

Interest rate risk
Telia Company

<<<

 manages interest rate risk by aiming to balance the estimated running cost of borrowing and the risk of significant negative impact on earnings, should there be a sudden, major change in interest rates. Telia Company's policy is that the duration

<<<

 of interest of the debt portfolio should be from three years to seven years.
Financing risk
By having most of its borrowings with a longer maturity than the duration of interest, Telia Company is able to obtain the desired interest rate risk

<<<

 without having to assume a high financing risk. In order to further reduce the financing risk, Telia Company aims to spread loan maturity dates over a longer period.
Pension obligation risk
Telia Company has a significant amount of pension

<<<

 obligations, with a net present value of SEK 24.9 billion as of 31 December 2016 (SEK 23.2 billion at year end 2014). Telia Company maintains pension funds to secure these obligations, with plan assets amounting to SEK 26.1 billion based on

<<<

 market values at year end 2016 (SEK 25.1 billion at year end 2015). The actuarial calculation of pension obligations is based on three principal assumptions: discount rate, annual adjustments to pensions (inflation rate) and longevity. The

<<<

 sensitivity of the pension obligations to changes in the principal assumptions is as follows:

Change in assumption (p.p.)

Impact on pension obligations (SEK in millions)

Discount rate Annual adjustments to pensions Longevity

Financial reporting risks

The reporting of Telia Company's results of business operations and financial condition is based on internal and external financial reporting, which

<<<

 has to be timely, reliable, correct, and complete. Internal controls over financial reporting is an integral part of Telia Company's corporate governance. It includes methods and procedures to safeguard the group's assets, ensure and control

<<<

 the reliability and correctness of financial reporting in accordance with applicable legislation and guidelines, improve operational efficiency and control the level of risk in the business operations.

The management of financial reporting

<<<

 risks is described in more detail in Telia Company's corporate governance statement. The corporate governance statement, including the description of internal controls, forms part of the official annual and sustainability report and has been

<<<

 examined by the external auditors.

Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the Capital Securities

Risks related to the Capital Securities generally

Set out below is a brief description of

<<<

 certain risks relating to the Capital Securities generally:

9

The Conditions contain provisions which may permit their modification without the consent o f all investors
The Conditions contain provisions for calling meetings of Holders to

<<<

 consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Holders including Holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Holders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority

<<<

.
Investors who purchase Capital Securities in denominations that are not an integral multiple in excess of SEK1,000,000 or 100,000 (as applicable) may be adversely affected if definitive Capital Securities are subsequently required to be issued

<<<


The SEK NC5.5 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities and the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities have denominations consisting of a minimum of SEK1,000,000 and integral multiples of SEK10,000 in excess thereof up to and including denominations

<<<

 of SEK1,990,000. The EUR NC6 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities have denominations consisting of a minimum of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof up to and including denominations of 199,000. It is possible that the Capital

<<<

 Securities may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples of SEK1,000,000 or 100,000 (as applicable). In such a case a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than SEK1,000,000 or 100,000 in

<<<

 their account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a definitive Capital Security in respect of such holding (should definitive Capital Securities be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of

<<<

 Capital Securities such that its holding amounts to the SEK1,000,000 or 100,000 (as applicable).
If definitive Capital Securities are issued, Holders should be aware that definitive Capital Securities which have a denomination that is not an

<<<

 integral multiple of SEK1,000,000 or 100,000 (as applicable) may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Risks related to the market generally
Set out below is a brief description of the principal market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange

<<<

 rate risk and legal risk:
An active secondary market in respect o f the Capital Securities may never be established or may be illiquid and this would adversely affect the value at which an investor could sell his Capital Securities
The Capital

<<<

 Securities may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Capital Securities in the secondary market (in

<<<

 which case the market or trading price and liquidity may be adversely affected) or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market.
The value o f the Capital Securities

<<<

 depends on a number o f economic,financial andpoliticalfactors
The value of the Capital Securities depends on a number of interrelated factors, including economic, financial and political events in Sweden or elsewhere, including factors affecting

<<<

 capital markets generally and the stock exchanges on which the Capital Securities are traded. The price at which a Holder will be able to sell the Capital Securities prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be substantial, from the

<<<

 issue price or the purchase price paid by such Holder.
10

I f an investor holds Capital Securities which are not denominated in the investor's home currency, they will be exposed to movements in exchange rates adversely affecting the value

<<<

 o f their holding. In addition, the imposition o f exchange controls in relation to any Capital Securities could result in an investor not receiving payments on those Capital Securities
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the SEK

<<<

 NC5.5 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities and the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities in Swedish krona and on the EUR NC6 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an

<<<

 investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than euro or, as the case may be, Swedish krona. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change

<<<

 (including changes due to devaluation of the euro or Swedish krona or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation

<<<

 in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the euro or Swedish krona, as the case may be, would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Capital Securities, (2) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal

<<<

 payable on the Capital Securities and (3) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Capital Securities.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect

<<<

 an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
Legal investment considerations

<<<

 may restrict certain investments
The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers

<<<

 to determine whether and to what extent (1) Capital Securities are legal investments for it, (2) Capital Securities can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Capital

<<<

 Securities. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Capital Securities under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.
Any decline in credit

<<<

 ratings assigned to the Issuer or the Capital Securities may affect the market value o f the Capital Securities and may not reflect all the risks associated with an investment in the Capital Securities and changes in rating methodologies may

<<<

 lead to the early redemption o f the Capital Securities
The Capital Securities have been assigned ratings by S&P and Moody's. The rating granted by each of S&P and Moody's or any other rating assigned to the Capital Securities may not reflect

<<<

 the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market and other factors that may affect the value of the Capital Securities. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn

<<<

 by the rating agency at any time.
In addition, each of S&P and Moody's or any other rating agency may change their methodologies or their application for rating securities with features similar to the Capital Securities in the future. This

<<<

 may include the relationship between ratings assigned to an issuer's senior securities and ratings assigned to securities with features similar to the Capital Securities, sometimes called "notching". If the rating agencies were to change their

<<<

 practices or their application for rating such securities in the future and the ratings of the Capital Securities were to be subsequently lowered, this may have a negative impact on the trading price of the Capital Securities.
If as a consequence

<<<

 of an amendment, clarification or change in the equity credit criteria of any Rating Agency (as defined in the Conditions), the Capital Securities are no longer eligible for the same or higher
11

category of equity credit attributed to the

<<<

 Capital Securities at the date of their issue, the Issuer may redeem the Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, as further described in the Conditions.
CRA Regulation
In general, European regulated investors are restricted under Regulation

<<<

 (EC) No. 1060/2009 (as amended) (the "CRA Regulation") from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under the CRA Regulation (and such registration

<<<

 has not been withdrawn or suspended subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending). Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit ratings issued by non

<<<

-EU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification

<<<

, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority ("ESMA") on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation is not

<<<

 conclusive evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the updated ESMA list.
The

<<<

 value o f the Capital Securities could be adversely affected by a change in English law or Swedish law or administrative practice
The Conditions are based on and governed by English law (other than the Conditions relating to subordination of

<<<

 the Capital Securities, which are based on and governed by Swedish law). No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of England and Wales or Sweden or administrative practice after the

<<<

 date of this Prospectus. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to laws or administrative practices after the date of this Prospectus.
The Global Capital Securities are held by or on behalf o

<<<

 fEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, meaning investors will have to rely on their proceduresfor transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Capital Securities will be represented by the Global Capital Securities except in certain

<<<

 limited circumstances described in each Permanent Global Capital Security. The Global Capital Securities will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in certain limited circumstances described

<<<

 in each Permanent Capital Global Security, investors will not be entitled to receive Definitive Capital Securities. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Capital Securities. While

<<<

 the Capital Securities are represented by the Global Capital Securities, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.
While the Capital Securities are represented by the Global

<<<

 Capital Securities, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Capital Securities by making payments to or to the order of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg for distribution to their account holders

<<<

. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Capital Security must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to receive payments under the Capital Securities. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records

<<<

 relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in the Global Capital Securities. Holders of beneficial interests in the Global Capital Securities will not have a direct right to vote in respect of the Capital Securities.

<<<

 Instead, such Holders will be permitted to act only to the extent that they are enabled by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.
12

Risks related to the structure of the Capital Securities
The Capital Securities are subordinated obligations

<<<

; accordingly, claims in respect o f the Capital Securities would rank junior to claims in respect o f unsubordinated obligations o f the Issuer in the event o f an Issuer Winding-up
The Capital Securities are direct, unsecured and subordinated

<<<

 obligations of the Issuer, ranking behind claims of unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer and creditors of the Issuer in respect of all Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined in the Conditions), pari passu without any preference among themselves

<<<

 and with any present and future outstanding Parity Securities of the Issuer (as defined in the Conditions) and in priority to payments to holders of all classes of share capital of the Issuer in their capacity as such holders.
In the event

<<<

 of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation (likvidation), bankruptcy (konkurs) or company re construction (foretagsrekonstruktion) of the Issuer (each an "Issuer Winding-up"), Holders will only be eligible to recover any amounts in respect

<<<

 of their Capital Securities if all claims in respect of more senior ranking obligations of the Issuer (whether secured or unsecured) have first been paid in full. If, on an Issuer Winding-up, the assets of the Issuer are insufficient to repay

<<<

 the claims of all senior-ranking creditors in full, the Holders will lose their entire investment in the Capital Securities. If there are sufficient assets to repay the claims of senior-ranking creditors in full but insufficient assets to enable

<<<

 it to pay claims in respect of the Capital Securities and all other obligations of the Issuer ranking pari passu with the Capital Securities, Holders will lose some or substantially all of their investment in the Capital Securities. The Holders

<<<

 therefore face a higher recovery risk than holders of unsubordinated obligations and Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined in the Conditions) of the Issuer.
Furthermore, subject to applicable law, no Holder may exercise, claim or plead any

<<<

 right of set-off, compensation or retention in respect of any amount owed to it by the Issuer in respect of, or arising under or in connection with, the Capital Securities and each Holder shall, by virtue of their holding, be deemed to have

<<<

 waived all such rights of set-off, compensation or retention.
In addition, if the financial condition of the Issuer deteriorates such that Issuer Winding-up may be anticipated, the market price of the Capital Securities can be expected to fall

<<<

, and such fall may be significant. A Holder that sells its Capital Securities in such an event may lose some or substantially all of its initial investment in the Capital Securities (whether or not an Issuer Winding-up subsequently occurs)

<<<

.
The Capital Securities are long-term securities and therefore an investment in Capital Securities constitutes a financial riskfor a long period
Unless the same have been earlier redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the SEK NC5.5 Fixed Rate

<<<

 Reset Capital Securities will be redeemed on 4 October 2077, the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities will be redeemed on the Interest Payment Date falling in October 2077 and the EUR NC6 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities will be redeemed

<<<

 on 4 April 2078. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Capital Securities at any time before these dates and Holders have no right to call for redemption of the Capital Securities.
Therefore, prospective investors should be aware

<<<

 that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Capital Securities for a long period and may not recover their investment before the end of this period.
The Issuer may defer interest payments
The Issuer may, at

<<<

 any time and in its sole discretion (except on the Maturity Date of the relevant Capital Securities or any other Interest Payment Date on which the relevant Capital Securities are to be redeemed),
13

elect to defer payment of all (but not

<<<

 some only) of the interest which would otherwise be paid on any Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Conditions), and the Issuer shall not have any obligation to make such payment and any failure to pay shall not constitute a default by

<<<

 the Issuer for any purpose.
Any interest not paid on an applicable Interest Payment Date and deferred shall constitute Deferred Interest and shall be paid in whole, but not in part, at any time, at the option of the Issuer or on the occurrence

<<<

 of a Deferred Interest Payment Event, as defined in the Conditions.
Any deferral of interest payments will be likely to have an adverse effect on the market price of the Capital Securities. In addition, as a result of such interest deferral

<<<

 provisions of the Capital Securities, the market price of the Capital Securities may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to the above provisions and may be more sensitive

<<<

 generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition.
The Issuer may redeem the Capital Securities early; investors should consider reinvestment risk
The Issuer will have the right to redeem the SEK NC5.5 Fixed Rate Reset Capital

<<<

 Securities in whole, but not in part, on the SEK NC5.5 Fixed Rate Reset First Reset Date or any Interest Payment Date thereafter, will have the right to redeem the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, on the

<<<

 SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate First Call Date or any Interest Payment Date thereafter, and will have the right to redeem the EUR NC6 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities on the EUR NC6 Fixed Rate Reset First Reset Date or any Interest Payment Date

<<<

 thereafter, in each case at their principal amount together with any Deferred Interest and any other accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of redemption.
The Issuer may also, at its option, redeem the SEK NC5.5 Fixed Rate

<<<

 Reset Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, and/or the EUR NC6 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, upon the occurrence of a Tax Deductibility

<<<

 Event, a Capital Event, a Change of Control Event, a Withholding Tax Event or a Substantial Repurchase Event with respect to the relevant Capital Securities, as further described in the Conditions.
In the case of a Tax Deductibility Event or

<<<

 a Capital Event, such redemption will be at (i) 101 per cent. of the principal amount of the relevant Capital Securities, where such redemption occurs (in the case of the SEK NC5.5 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities) before the SEK NC5.5 Fixed

<<<

 Rate Reset First Reset Date, (in the case of the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities) before the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate First Call Date or (in the case of the EUR NC6 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities) before the EUR NC6 Fixed Rate

<<<

 Reset First Reset Date, or (ii) 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the relevant Capital Securities, where such redemption occurs on or after the relevant date specified in (i) above, together in each case with any Deferred Interest and

<<<

 any other accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the redemption date.
In the case of a Withholding Tax Event, a Change of Control Event or a Substantial Repurchase Event, such redemption will be at 100 per cent. of the principal

<<<

 amount of the relevant Capital Securities, together with any Deferred Interest and any other accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the redemption date.
During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Capital Securities

<<<

, the market value of the Capital Securities generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed.
The Issuer might redeem the Capital Securities when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the

<<<

 Capital Securities. There can be no assurance that, at the relevant time, Holders will be able to reinvest the amounts received upon redemption at a rate that will provide the same return as their investment in the Capital Securities. Potential

<<<

 investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
14

Substitution or variation o f the Capital Securities
There is a risk that, after the issue of the Capital Securities, a Tax Deductibility

<<<

 Event, a Capital Event or a Withholding Tax Event may occur which would entitle the Issuer, without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Holders, to substitute the relevant Capital Securities for, or vary the terms of the relevant

<<<

 Capital Securities so that they become or remain, Qualifying Capital Securities (as defined in the Conditions).
Whilst Qualifying Capital Securities are required to have terms which are not materially less favourable to Holders than the terms

<<<

 of the relevant Capital Securities (as reasonably determined by the Issuer in consultation with an independent investment bank, independent financial adviser or legal counsel of international standing), there can be no assurance that the Qualifying

<<<

 Capital Securities will not have a significant adverse impact on the price of, and/or the market for, the Capital Securities, nor that there will not be any adverse tax consequences for any Holders of the Capital Securities arising from such

<<<

 substitution or variation.
Fixed rate securities have a market risk
The SEK NC5.5 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities and the EUR NC6 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities will bear interest at a fixed rate, each reset by reference to a mid-swap

<<<

 rate plus a margin on the first reset date for the relevant Capital Securities and on each fifth anniversary of such first reset date. A holder of a security with a fixed interest rate is exposed to the risk that the price of such security

<<<

 falls as a result of changes in the current interest rate on the capital market (the "Market Interest Rate"). While the nominal interest rate of a security with a fixed interest rate is fixed during the life of such security or during a certain

<<<

 period of time, the Market Interest Rate typically changes on a daily basis. A change of the Market Interest Rate may cause the price of such security to change. If the Market Interest Rate increases, the price of such security typically falls

<<<

. If the Market Interest Rate falls, the price of a security with a fixed interest rate typically increases. Potential investors should be aware that movements of the Market Interest Rate can adversely affect the price of the relevant Capital

<<<

 Securities and can lead to losses for the Holders if they sell such Capital Securities.
Each reset interest rate may be different from the initial interest rate of the relevant Capital Securities and may adversely affect the yield of such Capital

<<<

 Securities.
Floating rate securities may suffer a decline in interest rate
The SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities will bear interest at a floating rate, set by reference to a 3month interbank offered rate plus a margin. A holder of

<<<

 a security with a floating interest rate is exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income. Fluctuating interest rate levels make it impossible to determine the yield of such securities in advance.
Each

<<<

 reset interest rate may be different from the initial interest rate of the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities and may adversely affect the yield of the SEK NC5.5 Floating Rate Capital Securities.
Reform and Regulation o f "benchmarks

<<<

 "
So-called benchmarks such as the Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate ("STIBOR"), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR"), ISDAFIX (now restructured and renamed the ICE Swap Rate) referenced swap rates and other indices which are deemed 

<<<

"benchmarks" (each a "Benchmark" and together, the "Benchmarks"), to which the interest on securities may be linked to, have become the subject of regulatory scrutiny and recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for

<<<

 reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause the relevant benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or have other consequences which may have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on the value of and the amount payable under the Capital Securities.
15

International proposals for reform of Benchmarks include the European Council's regulation (EU) 2016/1011 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments

<<<

 and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds (the "Benchmark Regulation") which was published in the official journal on 29 June 2016. In addition to the aforementioned regulation, there are numerous other proposals

<<<

, initiatives and investigations which may impacts Benchmarks.
Any changes to a Benchmark as a result of the Benchmark Regulation or other initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on the costs of refinancing a Benchmark or the costs

<<<

 and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a Benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer

<<<

 or participate in certain Benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain Benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain Benchmarks. Although it is uncertain whether or to what extent any of the abovementioned

<<<

 changes and/or any further changes in the administration or method of determining a Benchmark could have an effect on the value of the Capital Securities, investors should be aware that they face the risk that any changes to the relevant Benchmark

<<<

 may have a material adverse effect on the value of and the amount payable under the Capital Securities.
Holders o f the Capital Securities have very limited rights in relation to the enforcement o fpayments on the Capital Securities
If a default

<<<

 is made by the Issuer for a period of 30 days or more in relation to the payment of any interest, principal or premium in respect of the Capital Securities which is due and payable, the rights of the Holders in respect of the Capital Securities

<<<

 are limited to instituting proceedings for an Issuer Winding-up, and the Holders may prove and/or claim in respect of the Capital Securities in an Issuer Winding-up.
Whilst the claims of the Holders in an Issuer Winding-up are for the principal

<<<

 amount of their Capital Securities together with any Deferred Interest and any other accrued and unpaid interest, such claims will be subordinated as provided above under "The Capital Securities are subordinated obligations; accordingly, claims

<<<

 in respect of the Capital Securities would rank junior to claims in respect of unsubordinated obligations o f the Issuer in the event o f an Issuer Winding-up". The Holders shall not be entitled to accelerate payments of interest or principal

<<<

 under the Capital Securities in any circumstances outside an Issuer Windingup. Furthermore, whilst the Holder may institute other proceedings against the Issuer to enforce the terms of the Capital Securities, the Issuer shall not, by virtue

<<<

 of such proceedings, be obliged to pay any sum or sums sooner than the same would otherwise have been payable by it.
Accordingly, the Holders' rights of enforcement in respect of payments under the Capital Securities are very limited.
No limitation

<<<

 on issuing or guaranteeing debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Capital Securities
There is no restriction in the Conditions on the amount of debt which the Issuer may issue or guarantee. The Issuer and its subsidiaries and affiliates

<<<

 may incur additional indebtedness or grant guarantees in respect of indebtedness or guarantees of third parties, including indebtedness that ranks pari passu with or senior to the Capital Securities. The issue of any such securities or the

<<<

 incurrence of any such other liabilities may reduce the amount (if any) recoverable by Holders on an Issuer Winding-up and/or may increase the likelihood of a deferral of interest payments under the relevant Capital Securities.

Regulation
European Union
As Member States of the

<<<

 European Union (the "EU"), Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are required to follow EU regulations and enact domestic legislation to give effect to EU directives. Norway is under similar obligations as a party to the European

<<<

 Economic Area Agreement.
In 2009, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted a revised regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (the "EU Communications Framework"), which applies to the types of

<<<

 telecommunications services that Telia Company offers. The EU Communication Framework aims at driving competition in the sector as well as
105

providing sector specific consumer protection. The EU Communications Framework is currently being

<<<

 reviewed, and the European Commission adopted their proposal for a new framework in September 2016. The new framework is expected to be finally adopted in 2019 or 2020. The new framework, often referred to as the Code, is meant to provide for

<<<

 more harmonised and generic rules and, in certain instances, will apply to non-traditional telecommunication providers (so called "Over-The-Top" players). The draft Code provides some positive proposals relating to spectrum assignments as well

<<<

 as access rules, however it is at this point of time difficult to predict the outcome for these provisions in the finally adopted Directive.
National regulatory authorities ("NRAs"), including those in the countries in which Telia Company operates

<<<

, are expected to undertake a market analysis on the basis of markets listed in so-called Relevant Market Recommendations established by the European Commission (the "Commission Recommendations"). The present Commission Recommendation of October

<<<

 2014 comprises 4 (including 3a and 3b) markets that the NRAs must analyse. NRAs then determine and designate companies having significant market power ("SMP") within those markets. They can also impose or maintain ex ante sector-specific obligations

<<<

 when ex post remedies of competition law are not adequate to meet the market problems identified. Possible obligations could include inter alia transparency, accounting separation, network access and price control. If a market is found to be

<<<

 effectively competitive, existing obligations should, according to the regulatory framework, be withdrawn. The revised EU telecoms rules inter alia give the European Commission the power to oversee regulatory remedies proposed by national regulators

<<<

 (e.g. on the conditions of access to the network of an SMP operator; or on fixed or mobile termination rates). The objective is to avoid inconsistent regulation that could distort competition in the single telecoms market.
There are also special

<<<

 directives on electronic commerce, payment services and on a number of other areas of relevance to Telia Company's operations. The regulatory regimes in each of the aforesaid countries in which Telia Company operates are generally based on

<<<

 the requirements of the EU Communications Framework and other directives.
In 2007, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted a roaming regulation which introduced price caps on both wholesale and retail voice calls, data roaming

<<<

 and SMS, decreasing annually until 2016. Since 2007, the EU has modified the roaming regulation several times and the latest version was adopted in November 2015 as the so called "Telecom Single Market Regulation". The Telecom Single Market

<<<

 Regulation stipulates that from the end of April 2016 roaming retail prices must be significantly reduced (caps will be domestic price levels per unit and a surcharge which is equal to the wholesale caps). From June 2017 operators will not

<<<

 be allowed to apply any surcharges for retail roaming and "Roam-Like-At-Home" (RLAH) will be introduced. In certain instances operators will still be allowed to apply a surcharge, namely when the customer has reached a so-called Fair-use-policy

<<<

 ("FUP"). The FUP will assist operators to prevent abuse and anomalous roaming usage. In end of January 2017 the trilogue negotiations were finalised regarding the wholesale caps which will be applied from June 2017 until 2022.
The Telecom Single

<<<

 Market Regulation also addresses net neutrality. The net neutrality legislation is meant to ensure that users will be free to access the content of their choice. Internet access service providers will not be allowed to unfairly block or slow

<<<

 down internet traffic, and paid prioritisation will not be allowed. The law still permits Internet access providers to offer specialised services of higher quality, such as Internet TV and new innovative applications, so long as these services

<<<

 are not supplied at the expense of the quality of the open Internet. These new obligations came into force on 30 April 2016.
In January 2012 the European Commission proposed a General Data Protection Regulation which was supported by the European

<<<

 Parliament on March 2014. The Regulation was finally adopted in
106

April 2016 and will come into force in May 2018. The objective of the Regulation is to ensure Europeans get more control over their personal data, and make it easier for

<<<

 businesses to operate and innovate in the EU's Single Market under a harmonised set of rules. The new rules focus on strict accountability of data controllers and will be enforced by strict sanctions.
Implementation of EU Communications Framework

<<<


Sweden
In Sweden, the Act on Electronic Communications implements the legislation relating to the EU Communications Framework. Telia Company has SMP status on the wholesale markets for interconnection in the fixed network and in the mobile

<<<

 network and for network infrastructure access. The Swedish NRA ("PTS") has imposed obligations on all of these markets. On the market for network infrastructure access, PTS has imposed an obligation of non-discrimination based on Equivalence

<<<

 of Input, effective from 1 December 2016. At the same time, the price regulation on fibre access was withdrawn. PTS has started a new analysis on this market.
On the markets for terminating segments of leased lines and on the market for access

<<<

 to the public telephone network PTS has withdrawn the SMP status for Telia Company. However, the decisions has not yet gained legal force.
Finland
In Finland, Telia Company is subject to the Information Society Code and related regulations

<<<

, decrees and administrative decisions which implement the EU Communications Framework. The Information Society Code integrates key provisions that apply to the communications industry under one Act. The new legislation, applicable in full since

<<<

 July 2015, not only integrated the current legislation, but also amended the rules in several areas such as privacy, consumer protection and SMP regulation.
Telia Company and its competitors are subject to obligations in the following markets

<<<

, where the Finnish NRA ("Ficora") has issued SMP decisions: call termination on individual fixed networks, wholesale unbundled access, wholesale termination of segments of leased lines, wholesale broadband access and voice call termination

<<<

 on individual mobile networks.
The wholesale unbundled access markets and wholesale broadband access markets are currently being analysed by Ficora, based on the European Commission's new Relevant Market Recommendation. Ficora has also developed

<<<

 a new LRIC+ cost calculation model to be used for wholesale unbundled access market. Ficora has in January 2017 published its draft SMP decisions for national consultation. The new SMP decisions will be issued during the first half of 2017

<<<

 at the earliest.
The national legislation implementing EU Directive 2014/61/EU on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks has been applied from July 2016. The new legislation on shared construction

<<<

 and shared use of infrastructure would oblige the communications and electricity network operators, as well as water supply and transport network operators, to agree to reasonable shared use or construction of networks. The collaborative obligation

<<<

 would apply to access to existing passive network infrastructures with reasonable terms and coordination of civil works. The directive will also oblige network operators and authorities to provide information on future network projects and

<<<

 for existing networks to be generally available through a centralised information service.
107

Other
In Norway, Telia Norway has been designated an SMP operator in the market for mobile termination.
In Denmark Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania

<<<

, Telia Company's companies have been found to have SMP status both in fixed and mobile markets.
Implementation of pricing restrictions such as fixed or cost-based pricing or other obligations imposed by the relevant NRAs on Telia Company in

<<<

 any of the jurisdictions it operates might have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Competition Laws
Telia Company is subject to the competition laws o f the countries in which it operates, local

<<<

 competition laws and rules and EU competition laws. Companies breaching the competition rules may be forced to pay damages that can be substantial.
The European Union
The EU competition rules set out in the EC Treaty and EU legislation are

<<<

 binding on EU Member States and are therefore applicable to Telia Company's operations in the EU. If those rules are breached, the European Commission may impose fines o f up to ten per cent o f a company's revenues on a consolidated basis

<<<

 in the preceding financial year. The EU competition rules are applicable to restrictions on competition which may have an appreciable effect on trade between Member States.
So long as Sweden exercises a significant influence over Telia Company

<<<

, the European Commission could bring proceedings against Telia Company directly, or bring proceedings against the Sweden, to ensure that Telia Company complies with EU competition rules. This means that Telia Company might face two different

<<<

 proceedings, the latter o f which it could not directly influence and to which it would not be a party.
Given that the Swedish State holds 37.3 per cent of Telia Company's outstanding shares, there is always a risk that Telia Company's competitors

<<<

 might allege that Telia Company's transactions with the Swedish State involve an element of state aid, or that the European Commission may launch a formal investigation of such a transaction on its own initiative. The European Commission has

<<<

 the power to order suspension of aid payments and require the recovery of aid already granted, including accrued interest. These rules do not apply when a state contributes capital in circumstances that would be acceptable to a private investor

<<<

 operating under normal market economy conditions.
The local competition authorities in the relevant markets where Telia Company is present are empowered to issue injunctions, and to enjoin a party to discontinue immediately practices that are

<<<

 not permitted under the local competition acts. The competition authorities and the NRAs can cooperate to facilitate investigations o f anti-competitive behaviour in the telecommunications services sector.
International Obligations
Over 70

<<<

 member countries of the World Trade Organisation have entered into a Basic Telecommunications Agreement ("BTA") to provide market access to some or all of their basic
108

telecommunications services. The BTA took effect in February 1998.

<<<

 Signatories under the BTA have made commitments to provide "market access", requiring them to refrain from imposing certain quotas or other quantitative restrictions in specified telecommunications services sectors, and to provide "national

<<<

 treatment" by ensuring that foreign telecommunications service suppliers are accorded the same treatment as national service suppliers. In addition, a number of signatories, including Sweden and Finland, have agreed to abide by certain pro

<<<

-competitive principles set forth in a reference paper relating to the prevention of anti-competitive behaviour, interconnection, universal service, transparency of licensing criteria, independence of the regulator and non discriminatory allocation

<<<

 of scarce resources.
Sustainability
Governance andfocus areas
The term "sustainability" covers all efforts related to how Telia Company accounts for its long-term impact on society and the environment. This means managing ethical and legal

<<<

 requirements, risks and opportunities in the operations and throughout the value chain. Telia Company's sustainability work involves ensuring the health and safety of employees, minimising negative environmental impact, respecting human rights

<<<

, complying with ethical business practices in all markets, improving the protection of customer privacy and more.
Implementation issues and follow-up related to sustainability risks, opportunities and compliance are discussed within the Board

<<<

 of Directors' Sustainability and Ethics Committee. Group Executive Management and the Governance, Risk, Ethics and Compliance (GREC) meetings are the main discussion and decision-making forums. The Head of the Sustainability Strategy function

<<<

 within group staff function Corporate Affairs and Compliance Officer, who is responsible for the compliance framework, together manage group-level prioritisation, coordination and oversight of sustainability issues.
In 2016, Telia Company's

<<<

 sustainability work focused on the following areas:  Anti-corruption;
 Freedom of expression;
 Customer privacy;
 Occupational health and safety;
 Sustainability in the supply chain; and
 Environmental responsibility.
Sustainability reporting

<<<


Telia Company annually reports its sustainability performance in the combined Annual and Sustainability Report. The sustainability reporting is reviewed by the external auditors. Telia Company applies the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines

<<<

 for reporting on sustainability including the telecommunications sector supplement pilot.
Telia Company's commitments
Telia Company is committed to the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the core conventions of the International

<<<

 Labour Organisation (ILO). The Group has also made a
109

commitment to observe the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact. These commitments are incorporated into the Code of

<<<

 Ethics and Conduct. According to a self-assessment, Telia Company's work and commitments are in line with the ISO 26000 Guidance on Social Responsibility.
Whistle-blowing process
The Board of Directors has established a whistle-blowing process

<<<

 enabling employees and others to anonymously report violations in accounting, reporting or internal controls, as well as non compliance with local laws or breaches of Telia Company's policies and ethical instructions. The solution is hosted

<<<

 by an external service provider specialising in operating confidential telephone and online reporting systems.
Mergers and acquisitions
Group staff function Corporate Affairs is responsible for mergers and acquisitions in order to further strengthen

<<<

 internal controls by separating the elements of execution and control. A merger and acquisitions manual containing instructions and outlining a clear process for conducting acquisitions governs the activities.

Investigations in relation to investments

<<<

 in Uzbekistan and review of transactions in Eurasia
In September 2012, serious allegations were directed at Telia Company in relation to the company's investments in Uzbekistan. On 26 September 2012, the Swedish Public Prosecutor, Gunnar Stetler

<<<

, informed Telia Company that he was conducting an investigation into Telia Company's investment in a telecommunication operator business in Uzbekistan. On 3 October 2012, the Board of Directors of Telia Company assigned the law firm Mannheimer

<<<

 Swartling, led by its Chairman Birn Riese, to investigate whether Telia Company's investment in a 3G licence, frequencies and number blocks in Uzbekistan in 2007 involved corruption or money laundering. Later, the investigation was expanded

<<<

 to include the recent investments in connection with Telia Company's operations in Uzbekistan. Following the report presented by Birn Riese on 1 February 2013, the Board of Directors concluded that Mannheimer Swartling has not found any substance

<<<

 to the allegations that Telia Company committed bribery or participated in money laundering in connection with its investments in Uzbekistan.
In March 2014, Telia Company has been informed that the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") has an

<<<

 ongoing investigation regarding Telia Company's transactions in Uzbekistan. The DOJ has sent a request for documents to Telia Company. In addition, Telia Company has received a request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

<<<

 to submit documents and information related to Uzbekistan.
The Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office (the "DPPO") has also launched an investigation into the bribery and money-laundering allegations, visiting the offices of, and requesting documents

<<<

 from, two of Telia Company's Netherlands-based holding companies, Telia Company UTA Holding BV and Telia Company Uzbek Telecom Holding BV. These holding companies handle Telia Company's Ucell operation in Uzbekistan. As requested by the DPPO

<<<

, Telia Company has provided a bank guarantee of EUR 10 million as collateral for any financial claims which may be decided against Telia Company UTA Holding BV.
On 18 April 2013, the board of directors launched a review of transactions in Eurasia

<<<

, led by the international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. At Telia Company's annual general meeting on April 2, 2014, Marie Ehrling, the Chairman of the board, presented the outcome of the review, the scope and the methodology as well as the

<<<

 measures taken as consequence of the review. Based on the outcome of Norton Rose Fulbright's review, it has been determined that Telia Company has conducted its business in Eurasia in a manner that was inconsistent with sound business practice

<<<

 and Telia Company's ethical requirements. It cannot even be ruled out that certain conduct has been in violation of the law, something that will ultimately be decided by the judiciary.
As a consequence of this review, Telia Company has taken

<<<

 appropriate measures in order to reduce its risk exposure and conduct of business going forward, including the following:
112



Agreements with business partners have been renegotiated and in some cases terminated.



Agreements with an

<<<

 external advisor who since 2007 worked closely with the former

management regarding certain transactions in Eurasia have been terminated.



Changes in the Group Management have been implemented. As a consequence thereof,

several people

<<<

 have had to leave the company.



A number of changes have been made in terms of risk assessment, internal control,

management and board involvement and the establishment of a compliance programme.

Work to develop leadership and culture

<<<

 of the company is ongoing.



Telia Company continues its full cooperation with the Swedish Public Prosecutor, who

since previously is conducting an investigation into Telia Company's investment in

Uzbekistan. Material from NRF's review

<<<

 has been handed over to the Swedish prosecutor.



Telia Company is also cooperating with foreign governmental authorities investigating

matters in the Eurasia region.

Taxation
The statements below in relation are general in nature

<<<

 and neither these statements nor any other statements in this Prospectus are to be regarded as advice on the tax position of any holder of Capital Securities or any person purchasing, selling or otherwise dealing in Capital Securities. Prospective

<<<

 holders of Capital Securities and holders of Capital Securities who are in doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional advisers.
Swedish Taxation
Thefollowing overview outlines certain Swedish tax consequences of the

<<<

 acquisition, ownership and disposal of Capital Securities. The overview is based on the laws of the Kingdom of Sweden as currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only. The overview is not exhaustive and therefore does

<<<

 not address all potential aspects of Swedish taxation that may be relevant for a potential investor in the Capital Securities and is neither intended to be nor should be construed as legal or tax advice. In particular, the overview does not

<<<

 address situations where Capital Securities are held in an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto) or the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers of interest. Specific tax consequences, which are not described

<<<

 below, may be applicable to certain categories of corporations, e.g. investment companies and life insurance companies. Investors should consult their professional tax advisers regarding the Swedish and foreign tax consequences (including the

<<<

 applicability and effect of double taxation treaties) of acquiring, owning and disposing of Capital Securities in their particular circumstances.
Non-resident holders o f Capital Securities
As used herein, a non-resident holder means a holder

<<<

 of Capital Securities who is (a) an individual who is not a resident of Sweden for tax purposes and who has no connection to Sweden other than their investment in the Capital Securities, or (b) an entity not organised under the laws of Sweden

<<<

 or which is not otherwise resident in Sweden for tax purposes.
Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of any Capital Securities should not be subject

<<<

 to Swedish income tax provided that such holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Capital Securities are effectively connected. Under Swedish tax law, no withholding tax is imposed on payments of principal or on

<<<

 payments of amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of any Capital Securities.
Resident holders o f Capital Securities
As used herein, a resident holder means a holder of Capital Securities

<<<

 who is (a) an individual who is a resident in Sweden for tax purposes or (b) an entity organised under the laws of Sweden or which is otherwise resident in Sweden for tax purposes.
Generally, for Swedish corporations and private individuals

<<<

 (and estates of deceased individuals) that are resident holders of any Capital Securities, all capital income (for example income that is considered to be interest for tax purposes and capital gains on Capital Securities) will be taxable.
Specific

<<<

 tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder of Capital Securities realises a capital loss on the Capital Securities and to any currency exchange gains or losses.
If the Capital Securities are held by a Swedish resident

<<<

 nominee, including a Swedish Branch of a foreign nominee, in accordance with the Swedish Financial Instruments Accounts Act (SFS 1998:1479), Swedish
114

preliminary taxes are withheld by the nominee on payments of amounts that are considered

<<<

 to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a private individual (or an estate of a decease individual) that is a resident holder of any Capital Securities.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal

<<<

 Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA, a foreign financial institution (as defined by FATCA) may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (foreign passthru payments) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting

<<<

 or related requirements. The Issuer may be a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including Sweden) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States

<<<

 to implement FATCA (IGAs), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold

<<<

 under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Capital Securities, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or

<<<

 an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Capital Securities, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the

<<<

 Capital Securities, such withholding would not apply prior to 1 January 2019 and Capital Securities characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterised as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued

<<<

 on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be grandfathered for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially

<<<

 modified after such date (including by reason of a substitution of the Issuer). However, if further Capital Securities (as described under the Conditions of the Capital Securities) that are not distinguishable from previously issued Capital

<<<

 Securities are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all Capital Securities, including the Capital Securities offered prior to the expiration of

<<<

 the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in Capital Securities. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant

<<<

 to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the Capital Securities, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.
The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT")
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission

<<<

 published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT is Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States"). However, Estonia has

<<<

 since stated that it will not participate.
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in Capital Securities (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under the

<<<

 Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Capital Securities where at least one party is a

<<<

 financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a)

<<<

 by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
115

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation

<<<

 between participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Capital Securities are advised

<<<

 to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
116

Legal and Administrative Proceedings

<<<


In its normal course of business, Telia Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. These proceedings primarily involve claims arising out of commercial law issues and matters relating to telecommunications regulations and competition

<<<

 law. Further, Telia Company is involved in some proceedings related to interconnect fees, which could affect revenues.
In addition, there are still ongoing investigations in Sweden, the Netherlands and the USA regarding Telia Company's operations

<<<

 in Uzbekistan and suspected irregularities related to those and to the market entry into Uzbekistan. At this point in time, it is not possible to assess how or when the investigations will be resolved (for more information, see "Investigations

<<<

 in relation to investments in Uzbekistan and review of transactions in Eurasia" on pages 112-113).
Except for the proceedings described below, Telia Company or its subsidiaries are not involved in any legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings

<<<

 which management believes could have a material adverse effect on Telia Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Telia Company is also subject to the competition laws of the countries in which it operates, local competition

<<<

 laws and EU competition laws which may result in investigations, which if determined adversely to Telia Company could result in the payment of damages. During the second half of 2001, a number of operators filed complaints against Telia Company

<<<

 with the Swedish Competition Authority (the "Competition Authority"). The Competition Authority initiated an investigation regarding Telia Company's pricing of ADSL services. In December 2011, it was finally decided that Telia Company had abused

<<<

 its dominant position and Telia Company has paid a fine of SEK 35 million. The two operators Tele2 and Spray Network sued Telia Company for damages they alleged had been caused by the abuse in 2005 and 2006 respectively. The court of first

<<<

 instance ruled against Telia Company and awarded the plaintiffs damages amounting to SEK 305 million plus interest in total. Telia Company has appealed and the law suits for damages are still ongoing.
In 2005, Telia Company and Qukurova signed

<<<

 an agreement regarding Telia Company's purchase of shares in Turkcell Holding A.S. from Qukurova. As Qukurova subsequently did not honour the agreement, Telia Company brought legal action. On 1 September 2011, an International Chamber of Commerce

<<<

 (ICC) Arbitral Tribunal awarded Telia Company USD 932 million in damages, plus interest and costs, for Qukurova's
121

failure to deliver the Turkcell Holding shares as required under the share purchase agreement. Due to the refusal of Cukurova

<<<

 to honour the ICC award, Telia Company conducts legal action to pursue enforcement of the award. In parallel, Cukurova pursues legal actions against Telia Company with the aim to revert the ICC award or to refute its enforceability. Telia Company

<<<

 continues to vigorously pursue collection of the ICC award. Telia Company has not recorded any award amount receivable in the financial statements. Following an agreement with Alfa Telecom (now LetterOne) signed in November 2009, LetterOne

<<<

 is under certain circumstances entitled to receive part of the damages amount set out in the ICC award, if such funds will be successfully collected.
In 2012, Telia Company made an investment and acquired a minority stake in Kaztranscom (through

<<<

 the holding company Rodnik), a company that operates a fibrenetwork and provides ITC services for the corporate segment in Kazakhstan. There is now a dispute with another owner in Rodnik regarding, inter alia, the interpretation of agreements

<<<

 between the owners and of the management responsibilities of the company. During 2016, the other owner initiated arbitration proceedings in London against Telia Company and requested damages for alleged breach of contract and mismanagement

<<<

. Telia Company will vigorously defend itself in the proceedings that are expected to continue during 2017.
Auditors
The auditors of Telia Company are Deloitte AB, a member of the Swedish professional body FAR, with business address at Rehnsgatan

<<<

 11, SE-11379 Stockholm, Sweden. Deloitte AB have audited Telia Company's accounts, without qualification, in accordance with IFRS for each of the two financial years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016.
Conflicts
Certain of the Joint

<<<

 Bookrunners and their affiliates may have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services to, the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business

<<<

. Certain of the Joint Bookrunners and their affiliates may have positions, deal or make markets in the Capital Securities, related derivatives and reference obligations, including (but not limited to) entering into hedging strategies on behalf

<<<

 of the Issuer and its affliates, investor clients, or as principal in order to manage their exposure, their general market risk, or other trading activities.
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Joint Bookrunners

<<<

 and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts

<<<

 of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or Issuer's affiliates. Some of the Joint Bookrunners or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer

<<<

 routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Joint Bookrunners and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either

<<<

 the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Capital Securities. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Capital Securities. The Joint Bookrunners

<<<

 and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short

<<<

 positions in such securities and instruments.
