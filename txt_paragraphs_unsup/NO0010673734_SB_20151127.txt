13/2018"
Oslo, 27 November 2015
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Trustee") for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue ISIN NO 001 067373.4 (with total outstanding

<<<

 amount of USD 571 million) (the "Bond Issue" or "SEATRK") issued by Sea Trucks Group Limited (the "Issuer" or the "Company").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 25 March 20

<<<

13 and made between the Trustee and the Issuer (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. References to Clauses and paragraphs are references to Clauses and paragraphs in the Bond Agreement.
The information in this summons regarding

<<<

 the legal, operational and financial status of the Issuer is provided by the Issuer. The Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information given from the Issuer.
1. BACKGROUND
The Company issued SEATRK

<<<

 in March 2013 with the purpose of refinancing existing debt, financing capital expenditure and for general corporate purposes. The Group is an international group of companies offering offshore installation, accommodation and support services

<<<

 to the Oil & Gas industry worldwide. The Company has been providing marine services to major oil and construction companies in West Africa since the late 1970s and services clients around the world in shallow and deep-water projects with subsea

<<<

 construction and SURF1 solutions to accommodation, hook-up and fabrication activities.
The Company has offices in Nigeria, Angola, Ghana, United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, United States of America, Australia, Singapore and China. The Company

<<<

 owns and operates a fleet of over 180 vessels and barges, five of which are multi-purpose DP3 offshore installation vessels (the "DP3 Fleet").
On 26 August 2015, the Company published its unaudited management accounts for 1H 2015, with revenues

<<<

 of USD 259 million, down from USD 313 million in 1H 2014, and EBITDA of USD 37.8 million (excluding impairment charges), down from USD 76.2 million in 1H 2014. The Group's operating profit for 1H 2015 was USD (5.9) million, reflecting lower

<<<

 utilization as well as USD 8 million of impairments. The net profit was USD (14.4) million. Net financial debt per 30 June 2015 was USD 355 million (USD 601 million per YE 2014) and book equity was USD 581 million (YE 2014 USD 583 million)

<<<

.
The Bond Issue was initially secured against the five DP3 vessels of the Company as well as 26 other offshore vessels. Since the Settlement Date, another 13 newly built offshore vessels have been delivered and have been or are in the process

<<<

 of being added to the security package. In order to facilitate the removal of two small support vessels from the security pool, during 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 the Company repurchased and cancelled USD 4.0 million face value of Outstanding

<<<

 Bonds.
As of 30 June 2015, following the buyback offer for partial bond repurchase announced on 15 April 2015 and other purchases by the Company of Bonds in the market, the Company held USD 103 million face value of Outstanding Bonds. The Company

<<<

's holding in Bonds remains unchanged, at USD 103 million, as at the date
1 Subsea structures, Umbilicals, Risers, Flowlines
page 1

of this summons letter. Subject to the Bondholders' approval of the Proposal as detailed below, the Company

<<<

 will cancel its holdings in full on the date on which the Proposal becomes effective.
According to clause 13.6 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer is required to comply with the following Financial Covenants during the term of the Bond Issue

<<<

:
a) Liquidity of minimum USD 10 million; b) Asset cover ratio of minimum 150% at any time after 31 December 2014; c) Interest Coverage Ratio of not less than 2.5x; and d) maintain a positive Working Capital.
As of 30 June 2015, the Issuer's

<<<

 Liquidity was USD 111.5 million (covenant: USD 10.0 million), the Asset cover ratio 156% (covenant: 150%), and Interest Coverage Ratio 2.53x (covenant: 2.50x). The Working Capital coverage was positive with USD 177 million (covenant: positive

<<<

).
The Company considers its long-term prospects as good, based on its relative position in the markets in which it operates, its modern DP3 Fleet and the market-leading position of its conventional fleet in Nigeria. However the current offshore

<<<

 services market is significantly weaker than what was foreseen at the time of the issuance of the Bonds in 2013 due largely to a weak oil price and reduction in capital expenditure by the Company's clients and their partners. Further, following

<<<

 the election in Nigeria of a new president, the extended period of organizational change within the Nigerian government is expected to continue to cause delays to the award of projects in the Company's core market. The Company subsequently

<<<

 anticipates increased volatility in earnings going forward. These market conditions have contributed to a reduction in the Issuer's Liquidity from USD 111 million as of 30 June 2015 to USD 80 million on 30 September 2015. On preliminary budgets

<<<

, this is expected to be reduced to USD 40 ­ 60 million by year-end 2015, under the current debt structure.
Based on the market uncertainty described above, and volatility in earnings and cash flow, the Company will be more vulnerable to the

<<<

 Interest Coverage Ratio and the Asset cover ratio owing to circumstances outside the Company's control. The fixed debt repayment schedule will also leave the Company vulnerable to volatile earnings. The Company has worked to strengthen its

<<<

 financial position by the sale of Jascon 18; prioritizing utilization over day rates; expanding geographical focus and increasing activities in SE Asia, Brazil and Mexico; utilizing excess cash to reduce debt (including bond-buybacks); and

<<<

 via cost-cutting measures including salary cuts, headcount reductions, office closures and cold-stacking of vessels.
On the basis of the above, the Company would like to make certain amendments to the Bond Agreement as set out in detail in

<<<

 section 2 below in order to be better prepared for the expected volatility in earnings going forward. In summary, the proposed amendments are as follows:
1.1 Financial Covenants
With respect to the Interest Cover Ratio, the Company proposes

<<<

 to adjust the current requirement of 2.5x to the following levels:
 Suspension of the Interest Cover Ratio from 1 July 2015 up to and including the Quarter Date in June 2016;
 from 1 July 2016 to and including the Quarter Date in September

<<<

 2016 at 1.00x;  from 1 October 2016 to and including the Quarter Date in December 2016 at 1.25x;  from 1 January 2017 to and including the Quarter Date in March 2017 at 1.50x; and  1.75x at any time thereafter.
The Company proposes that the

<<<

 EBITDA calculations from 1 July 2016 onwards shall annualize the aggregate EBITDA generated from and including 1 July 2016 until four (4) quarters thereafter have been completed, after which the calculation shall revert to being based on the

<<<

 preceding 12 months.
In compensation for this adjustment, the Company proposes to increase the minimum Liquidity requirement from USD 10 million to USD 20 million, equal to approximately 6 months interest payment based on the current amount

<<<

 of Voting Bonds.
page 2

With respect to the Asset cover ratio, on the basis of an updated assessment of the Market Value of the Vessels, the Company proposes to reduce the requirement to a minimum of 140% from 1 July 2015 onwards.
1.2 Amortisations

<<<


1.2 (a) Adjustment to Instalments
For the reasons described above, the Company seeks approval to amend the scheduled Instalments of the six (6) consecutive quarters commencing from the Interest Payment Date in December 2015 set out in Clause

<<<

 10.1 Maturity and instalments.
The Company will pay the Instalment due on the Interest Payment Date in December 2015 equal to 2.5% of the Outstanding Bonds (i.e. an amount equal to USD 11,700,000) and that the earliest Instalments payable thereafter

<<<

 are fixed at 75% of any excess of Liquidity above USD 50 million (measured on the preceding Quarter Date).
This formula shall apply for the five (5) consecutive quarters commencing on the Interest Payment Date in March 2016 up to and including

<<<

 the Interest Payment Date in March 2017.
From the Interest Payment Date in June 2017 and thereafter, each Instalment shall be an amount equal to 2.5% of the Outstanding Bonds.
1.2 (b) Deletion of Jascon 18 Sale Event provision
Furthermore,

<<<

 the Company proposes to delete Clause 10.7 Jascon 18 Sale Event in its entirety. This clause currently states that each scheduled Instalment, following the occurrence of a sale of an interest in Jascon 18, shall have an incremental increase

<<<

 of up to 1% of the initial bond amount of USD 575,000,000.
1.2 (c) Insertion of Jascon 35 Sale Event provision
The Company proposes to insert a Clause 13.4 (h) Jascon 35 sale restriction requiring that any disposal outside the Group of interests

<<<

 (whether direct or indirect and whether in whole or in part) in the Jascon 35 must be for consideration in cash only. Furthermore, the Company proposes to insert a provision which will provide Bondholders with a Relevant Disposal equivalent

<<<

 to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds received by the Group in respect of an external cash sale of interests in the Jascon 35 exceed the combined total, pro rata the interests sold, of the construction cost and related capitalised interest

<<<

 and expenditure.
1.3 Intention to transfer ownership interests to West African Ventures Ltd. (Nigeria)
The award of project contracts in Nigeria favours contractors who can demonstrate Nigerian ownership of vessels. Regulation of local content

<<<

 requirements in Nigeria is controlled by the Nigerian Content Development Management Board ("NCDMB") which, since June 2013, has vigorously pursued a marine vessel utilization scheme (the "Scheme") which seeks to achieve at least 60% ownership

<<<

 of marine assets by Nigerian entities by 2015. The Scheme also seeks to encourage construction of vessels in Nigeria, stimulate flagging and registration of vessels in Nigeria and increase Nigerian manning of vessels. Under the Scheme, Nigerian

<<<

 vessel owners and vessels built in Nigeria are prequalified to participate in tenders based on a set of criteria established by the NCDMB. These criteria are described in the Marine Vessel Categorisation Procedure.
"Relevant Disposal"
In order

<<<

 to comply with NCDMB's requirements, in circumstances where a vessel (outside the Bond security package) is of comparatively low value and unencumbered, the Company has transferred ownership from an offshore subsidiary to its Nigerian affiliate

<<<

, West African Ventures Limited ("WAV"). WAV owns 19 vessels in the OOIM Fleet which are not a part of the Bond security package. These vessels are registered and flagged in Nigeria. WAV and the Company are commonly owned and WAV is for all

<<<

 relevant purposes managed by the same management as the Company.
page 3

However, where a vessel is encumbered, and in particular, by a mortgage for the benefit of the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), the process described above cannot

<<<

 be implemented and, consequently, WAV is disadvantaged and not entitled to first consideration for projects in Nigeria which require such a vessel. This detrimentally impacts the Company's ability to achieve high rates of utilization and revenue

<<<

 from the Vessels.
In 2014, in order to increase its local content, the Company desired to transfer ownership of Jascon 1 and Jascon 47 from the relevant Shipowning Subsidiaries to WAV. The aggregate value of these vessels was less than USD

<<<

 2.5 million. In October 2014, the Company agreed with the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that these vessels could be released from the Bond security package against the purchase and cancellation of Bonds equivalent to their applicable

<<<

 Redemption Amount which would have applied if the transaction constituted a Relevant Disposal. (The transaction did not constitute a Relevant Disposal because it was between two Group companies.) The Company purchased and cancelled Bonds accordingly

<<<

 and is currently in the process of removing these Vessels from the Bond security package.
At the time of that agreement, the Trustee indicated that a similar solution in respect of higher value assets would require Bondholder approval given

<<<

 that the Bond Agreement did not permit the Company to remove Vessels from the Bond security package in respect of an intra-Group transfer.
The Company therefore seeks approval to allow a Relevant Disposal to include a transfer of a Vessel between

<<<

 companies within the Group and for any such transaction to constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event.
"Permitted Financial Indebtedness"
Subsequent to any such Mandatory Prepayment Events and transfer of such vessels to Nigerian registration

<<<

 and flag, the Company may consider it prudent to offer the marine assets owned by WAV as collateral for further financial indebtedness. Any such financial indebtedness would probably be raised with financial institutions in Nigeria (further

<<<

 enhancing WAV's Nigerian local content). The Company proposes a limit on such financial indebtedness of USD 25,000,000 as an aggregate limit to include any financial indebtedness under the Group's facility at First Bank of Nigeria plc. described

<<<

 in the definition of Permitted Financial Indebtedness. There is slightly less than USD 7,000,000 outstanding at the date of this summons letter under that facility.
Transfers to WAV or another Group Company incorporated in Nigeria
While the

<<<

 consent requested to permit a Relevant Disposal to include an intra-Group transfer is likely to prove expedient for one or more comparatively low value vessels, it is unlikely to be practical with respect to higher value vessels because a Mandatory

<<<

 Prepayment is required to be made by the Company (subject to the exemption set out in clause 10.4). Accordingly, the Company intends to seek approval from Bondholders for an alternative structure (consistent with that described below) which

<<<

 enhances the Company's local content for projects in Nigeria. The terms of this alternative structure and the related approval to be sought from Bondholders are at an advanced stage of preparation among, inter alia, legal counsels respectively

<<<

 to the Company and the Trustee. The Company intends to issue to Bondholders either an amended version of this summons or a further summons in order to obtain this approval.
The Company (via WAV) continues to discuss with NCDMB appropriate ownership

<<<

 structures for the Vessels which do not materially impact the Bond security package, notably, the Vessel mortgages registered in Gibraltar and St. Vincent & The Grenadines.
Management considers that the Company would significantly increase

<<<

 its competitive ability to bid for contracts in Nigeria if it can demonstrate the greater "Nigerian content" required to satisfy the Scheme's objective of 60% direct Nigerian ownership in the relevant Vessels. The Company has received an opinion

<<<

 from Nigerian counsel which supports this view and a copy of this opinion has been provided to the Trustee and its counsel. The Company anticipates seeking approval to improve the Company's Nigerian content as follows:
page 4

The ownership

<<<

 of a vessel is historically divided into 64 shares and this concept is contained in the Nigerian Coastal and Inland Shipping (Cabotage) Act 2003. The Company has discussed the principle of transferring shares in a vessel with ship registration

<<<

 authorities in Gibraltar and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (where all the Vessels are registered), and those authorities have confirmed this possibility exists with a vessel consequently having more than one registered owner. Therefore:
The

<<<

 Company anticipates seeking approval to transfer up to 39 of 64 shares in the DP3 Vessels (being the equivalent of 60%) and up to 48 of 64 shares in the other Vessels to WAV or another Group Company incorporated in Nigeria. The different level

<<<

 of ownership transfer is a reflection of the greater competition in Nigeria of non DP3 Vessels and therefore a higher expectation of NCDMB with regard to Nigerian ownership.
The Company anticipates making a proposal to Bondholders setting out

<<<

 the changes that will be required to the security package and any additional costs that might be incurred in association with the changes.
1.4 Bareboat charters with third parties
Given the limited availability of project work in Nigeria and

<<<

 elsewhere, the Company considers that the opportunity to bareboat charter vessels to third parties can enhance the Company's ability to secure utilization and revenue for Vessels in the Other Offshore and Inland Marine Support Services ("OOIM

<<<

") fleet (i.e. not a DP3 Vessel) at acceptable levels of risk. The Trustee's consent is required before any such bareboat charter arrangement can be effected. The Company therefore seeks approval to bareboat charter vessels in the OOIM fleet

<<<

 to charterers other than Group Companies and affiliated companies.
1.5 Voluntary liquidation of Marine Asset Leasing Limited ("MALL")
The Company has created a wholly owned Netherlands-incorporated subsidiary, Sea Trucks Contracting B.V. (

<<<

"STCBV"), through which it will seek to enter and operate certain contracts outside Nigeria involving the DP3 Fleet from that company's offices in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where many of the functions supporting the DP3 Fleet are already located

<<<

. Following completion of all arrangements necessary to STCBV becoming a Guarantor, including a share pledge, over the shares of STCBV, granted by the shareholder of STCBV in favour of the Bond Trustee and the novation or assignment by MALL

<<<

 to STCBV of one charterparty, MALL will become inactive except for pursuit of one claim it has for unpaid hire in Mexico. MALL will serve no further purpose either to the Bondholders or to the Company. The Company therefore seeks approval that

<<<

 the voluntary liquidation of MALL may take place once all arrangements necessary to STCBV becoming a Guarantor, including a pledge from the relevant Subsidiary of its shares in STCBV in favour of the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders),

<<<

 have been completed to the satisfaction of the Trustee and resolution of MALL's claim in Mexico to the Company's satisfaction.
1.6 Removal of 4 OOIM vessels from the Vessels
The Company has sought to strengthen its financial position by reducing

<<<

 costs. The Company has identified an opportunity to reduce the operating costs associated with four Vessels which, in the Company's opinion, have reached the end of their useful life and on which the Company could save significant operating

<<<

 expense by their deregistration and decommissioning. The Vessels are as follows:
 Jascon 22: Built 1975, 8,000HP AHTS, 1,388 grt. Market value: approximately USD 700,000;  Walvis 6: Built 1982, 4,200HP AHTS, 1,070 grt. Market value: approximately

<<<

 USD 700,000;  Walvis 7: Built 1982, 4,200HP AHTS, 1,070 grt. Market value: approximately USD 700,000; and  Walvis 12: Built 1997, 2,560HP LH vessel 297 grt. Market value: approximately USD 650,000.
The Company therefore seeks approval to dispose

<<<

 of these four Vessels without, if applicable, triggering a Mandatory Prepayment Event.

<<<

 Limited

<<<

 necessary for Sea Trucks Contracting B.V. to become a Guarantor, including a pledge from the relevant Subsidiary of its shares in STCBV in favour of the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), have been completed to the satisfaction of the

<<<

 Trustee and that Bondholder approval of these resolutions shall be taken as confirmation that, from the date the Trustee notifies the Company of its said satisfaction, the Company may voluntarily liquidate Marine Asset Leasing Limited or take

<<<

 similar corporate action without such action constituting a breach of its obligations or a Guarantor's obligations under the Bond Agreement and/or any Security Document and that the Trustee is instructed to take such action as is necessary

<<<

 to release Marine Asset Leasing Limited as a Guarantor.
2.10 Removal of 4 Vessels from Bond security package
The Company proposes that Schedule 3 is amended as attached hereto and recalibrated to remove references to Jascon 22, Walvis 6, Walvis

<<<

 and take such action as is necessary to effect such release with no requirement for the Company to make any Mandatory Prepayment (if applicable).
Notwithstanding the amendment to the Asset cover ratio proposed herein, the Company notes that

 (i) following removal of vessels proposed in this section, the Market Value of the Vessels, pursuant to the valuation most recently completed under the terms of the Bonds and with effective date 18 November 2015, will become c. USD 731 million

<<<

; (ii) following cancellation of USD 103 million of Bonds as proposed herein, the par value of Outstanding Bonds will be USD 468 million; and (iii) the pro forma Asset cover ratio will, as a consequence, be c.156%, which is compliant with the
