Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Proposal for amendments

 to the Loan Agreement

1

INTRODUCTION

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bond issue "FRN Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2014" with ISIN

<<<

 NO 001 036172.8 (the "Bonds" or the "Loan") where Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd (the "Company") is the issuer and borrower.

All capitalised terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement for

<<<

 the Loan (the "Loan Agreement") between the Company and the Loan Trustee dated 11 April 2007, as amended on 10 March 2011.

The information in this Sammons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status o f the Company is provided by

<<<

 the Company, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its entirety.

BACKGROUND

Under clause 10.1(a) of the Loan Agreement, the Company

<<<

 was required to make an Amortization Payment of USD 15,000,000 on the Interest Payment Date falling in April 2012 (such Interest Payment Date being 16 April 2012). Further to a Bondholders Meeting on April 2012 the due date of that Amortization

<<<

 Payment was extended from 16 April 2012 to 16 May 2012 whilst the Company pursued discussions with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "Committee") and certain other Bondholders which together hold in excess of 66 2A% of the principal

<<<

 amount of the outstanding Bonds, in relation to a possible restructuring of the terms of the Loan. Those discussions continue.

Failure to make payment of the Amortization Payment on 16 May 2012 will give rise to an Event of Default under clause

<<<

 15.1(a) of the Loan Agreement. The Company still does not have sufficient funds available to it to pay this Amortization Payment.

The Company believes that, subject to appropriate terms being agreed, a restructuring of the terms of the Loan

<<<

 would be beneficial for all stakeholders. Furthermore, whilst there is no certainty that an agreement for such a restructuring can ultimately be reached, the Company believes that, as an interim step, it would be beneficial for all stakeholders

<<<

 to agree to extend the due date of the Amortization Payment due on 16 May 2012 to enable restructuring discussions to continue. The Company therefore seeks an extension of the due date of the next Amortization Payment from 16 May 2012 to 1

<<<

5 June 2012 (the "Extension"), with the other terms of the Loan Agreement remaining unchanged.

In consideration for the Bondholders granting the Extension, the Company shall:

· provide both the Loan Trustee and the Committee with an email update by no later than 12 noon GMT on each Tuesday, up to and

<<<

 including 12 June 2012 (the "Performance Updates") setting out the operational performance of the FPSO vessels "Rubicon Intrepid" and "Rubicon Vantage" over the previous calendar week; and

· deliver to Norsk Tillitsmann ASA the original share

<<<

 certificate in the Company (in connection with the ownership of the Company by Rubicon Holdings Limited) on or before 25 May 2012.

Failure to comply with either of the above conditions shall entitle the Loan Trustee or any member(s) of the

<<<

 Committee together holding Bonds representing not less than 'A of the value of the Remaining Loan to terminate the Extension by giving written notice to the Company (the "Termination Notice"). On the Banking Day which falls four clear Banking

<<<

 Days after the date on which the Termination Notice is served (the "New Payment Date"), the Extension will immediately cease to have effect and the Amortization Payment which was due on 16 May 2012 shall be immediately due and payable on the

<<<

 New Payment Date. Failure to make the Amortization payment in full on the New Payment Date shall constitute an Event of Default under the Bonds.

PROPOSAL

Based on the foregoing, the Company hereby asks the Bondholders' meeting to approve

<<<

 the following proposal (the "Proposal"):

It is proposed that subject to the right of the Loan Trustee or any member(s) of the Committee together holding Bonds representing not less than 'A of the value of the Remaining Loan to serve a Termination

<<<

 Notice, as described in the Summons, the due date of the Amortization Payment due on 16 May 2012 shall be extended such that the Amortization Payment falls due on 15 June 2012. For the avoidance of doubt the Company shall still be required

<<<

 to pay to the Bondholders in full all other amounts payable under the Loan Agreement, when due.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

The Company's evaluation:

The Company believes that the Proposal is the best interim solution for all stakeholders

<<<

 including the Bondholders in view of the Company's current financial situation.

<<<

 the Proposal.

The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Trustee or the Committee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes

<<<

 are acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal and financial advisers regarding the effect of the Proposal.
