2. REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE AMENDMENT OF THE EQUITY RATIO DEFINITION AND REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF THE EQUITY RATIO
The Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee with a request to convene a Bondholders' Meeting in respect of the Bond Issue

<<<

 in order to put forward a proposal to the Bondholders as set out below (the "Proposal"): 2.1 Requestfor Clarification of the Amendment of the Equity Ratio
2.1.1 Background By the Amendment Agreement, Clause 1.1 (Definitions) was amended as

<<<

 follows:

a. A new definition of "NGAAP" was inserted to read as follows:
""NGAAP" means the generally accepted accounting practice and principles in Norway."
b. The definition of "Book Equity" was amended and restated to be read as follows

<<<

:
""Boole Equity" means the consolidated equity as presented in the accounts, calculated in accordance with NGAAP consistently applied."
c. The definition of "Book Total Assets" was amended and restated to be read as follows:
""Book Total Assets

<<<

" means the consolidated book value of the total assets of the Issuer in accordance with NGAAP, excluding goodwill."
d. The definition of "Equity Ratio" was amended and restated to be read as follows:
""Equity Ratio" means the ratio of the Book

<<<

 Equity to Book Total Assets on a consolidated basis for the Group, to be reported within each Reporting Date based on NGAAP."
The intention of the Issuer was not that its accounts should be made in accordance with NGAAP, but when calculating

<<<

 the Equity Ratio, the Issuer should be allowed to use the Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Reports prepared according to IFRS and make appropriate adjustments to account for any outstanding warrants as equity according to NGAAP

<<<

.
2.1.2 New Amended Definitions
The Issuer propos that:
(A) a new definition of "IFRS" is inserted to be read as follows:
"IFRS" means the generally accepted accounting practice and principles o f the International Financial Reporting Standards

<<<

 (IFRS) and guidelines and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (or any predecessor and successor thereof), inforce fi'om time to time.
(B) the definition of "Book Equity" is amended to be read as follows:


<<<

"Book Equity "means the aggregate amount which would in accordance with IFRS be shown in the Issuer'sfinancial statements as the shareholders ' equity o f the Group on a consolidated basis, adjustedfo r positive or negative effects (as the case

<<<

 may be) o f any difference in accounting o f outstanding warrants as equity according to NGAAP and IFRS.
(C) the definition of "Total Assets" is amended to be read as follows:
"Total Assets" means the aggregate amount which would in accordance

<<<

 with IFRS be shown in the Issuer's financial statements as total assets o f the Group on a consolidated basis, adjusted fo r positive or negative effects (as the case may be) o f any difference in accounting o f outstanding warrants as equity

<<<

 according to NGAAP and IFRS.
-2-

(D) the definition of "Equity Ratio" shall be amended to be read as follows:
"Equity Ratio " means the ratio o fBook Equity to Total Assets.
2.2 Requestfo r Waiver o f the Equity Ratio
Further, the Issuer

<<<

 propos to waive the Equity Ratio requirement of minimum 25 % to and including end of 3rd quarter 2012 by amending Clause 13.5 of the Bond Agreement to be read as follows:
The Issuer shall ensure that the Group maintains an Equity Ratio o f

<<<

 minimum 25% from and including the 4th Quarter 2012 and any subsequent Quarter thereafter until the Final Maturity Date.
3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT BY THE ISSUER
Proposal 1: IFRS stipulates that any warrant issued by the Issuer

<<<

 shall be accounted for as equity if the warrant gives the Warrantholder a right to a fixed number of shares for a fixed exercise price. If either the number of shares or the exercise price is variable, the warrants shall be accounted for as

<<<

 debt. The warrants issued together with the Bond gives the Warrantholder the right to a lower exercise price and a higher number of shares for each quarter that the shares of the Issuer is not listed on an exchange. Under NGAAP, warrants can

<<<

 be accounted for as equity irrespective of the fixed-for-fixed criteria applied under IFRS.
In order to calculate an accurate Equity Ratio according to NGAAP, the Issuer will have to issue two sets of audited accounts. This would require the

<<<

 Issuer to prepare two sets of audited accounts for all subsidiaries and for the consolidated accounts, where the purpose of the NGAAP accounts would solely be to calculate the Equity Ratio. In order to avoid the time and cost of preparing full

<<<

 consolidated accounts according to NGAAP the Issuer requests the Bondholders to explicitly approve that the Issuer is allowed to calculate the Equity Ratio by using the audited accounts prepared according to IFRS and account for warrants issued

<<<

 by the Issuer as equity according to the principles accepted under NGAAP.
To avoid any uncertainty in calculation of the covenant in the Bond Agreement, the Issuer request that the Bondholders approve that the calculation of the Equity Ratio

<<<

 according to Clause 13.5 of the Bond Agreement shall be based on the IFRS group accounts and that the warrants issued by the Issuer shall be accounted for as equity according to NGAAP.
The proposal has no material effect on the performance

<<<

 of the Issuer, but will reduce the time and cost of preparing the Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Reports.
Proposal 2:
Based on the consolidated and audited financial statements for 2011 the Issuer is in breach of the Equity Ratio

<<<

 according to Clause 13.5 o f the Bond Agreement for 4lh quarter 2011. As no equity was provided to the Issuer during 1st quarter 2012, the Issuer was also in breach of the Equity Ratio for 1st quarter 2012.
The Issuer has obtained guaranteed

<<<

 equity funding of NOK 45 million through Arctic Securities. In accordance with the capital budget of the Issuer (attached), the Issuer will need further equity funding in order to comply with the Equity Ratio for 3rd quarter 2012. In order

<<<

 to approve the 2011 annual
-3 -

accounts based on the going concern criteria, the Issuer will need a waiver for the Equity Ratio for the period from 4th quarter 2011 to 3rd quarter 2012.
The Issuer requests that the Equity Ratio of the Group

<<<

 of minimum 25% set out in Clausel3.5
2(F0i1n2a.ncial Covenants) in the Bond Agreement is waved for 4* quarter 2011 and 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarter
If the waiver is not accepted by the Bondholders, the Issuer will have to consider whether the assumption

<<<

 of going concern is present when filing its 2011 accounts, as there will be uncertainty related to the status of the Bond loan. It is the opinion of the Issuer that this would jeopardise any on going negotiations with potential investors and

<<<

 make any further equity financing of the Issuer more difficult.
4. NON-RELIANCE
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether

<<<

 the proposed changes are acceptable.
