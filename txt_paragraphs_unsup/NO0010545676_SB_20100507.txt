<<<

 Oil & Gas Company ASA (the "Borrower"). All capitalized terms used in this document shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement of the Loan, or in this summons, unless expressly otherwise stated herein.
The information in

<<<

 this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1. Background

The previously proposed restructuring considered

<<<

 and accepted by the Bondholders meeting held 18 March 2010 has not been implemented, as the conditions has not been met. Mainly this concerns the condition of new equity being paid in which is not fulfilled. Reference is made to press releases

<<<

 from the Borrower on this topic. Due to time limitations in that resolution that restructuring plan has now expired.

Reference is made to the information given by the Borrower, the Borrowers financial advisor and an external Investor at the

<<<

 Information meeting held by the Borrower on 28 April 2010. Bondholders not present at the meeting may contact the Borrowers financial advisor for an update.

According to the Borrower the liquidity situation is critical, and there is an urgent

<<<

 need for short term funding in order to survive to find and implement a longer term solution. The Loan Agreements places certain restrictions on the Borrowers right to issue new debt and the terms of such new debt.

Aladdin Oil & Gas Co. has

<<<

 engaged Lyche, Holst & Partners as their financial advisor ("the advisor") with respect to this proposal. Bondholders may contact the advisor on +47 22403120/ +47 22403030 or Jørn Barkenæs, AOG's Chief Financial Officer on +47 22979900 for

<<<

2. The Proposal

<<<

:
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholder's meeting to consider certain waivers and amendments of terms of the 2012 Bond as set out here in section 2 of the Summons (the "Proposal") to allow the Borrower some time

<<<

 to pursuit a possible financial restructuring. Bondholders' Meetings have been summoned for the 2009 Bond and 2011 Bond for an earlier date as they have different notice period requirements.
In short, the Borrower proposes that the Bondholders

<<<

 waive the restrictions in the Loan Agreements in order to allow the Borrower to incur a short term loan. The 2011 Bond and the 2012 Bond had interest payments due on 2 May 2010. The Borrower was not in a position to meet these interest payments

<<<

. The Borrower proposes that the Bondholders of these bond issues grant an extension of the payment of these interest amounts. The Borrower also propose that the Bondholders waive the Cross default clause to the extent that the missed interest

<<<

 payments for the 2011 Bond and the 2012 Bond shall not trigger a cross default for any of the Loans. Further the Borrower proposes for the 2012 Bond to shorten the notification period to summon a Bondholders meeting from 10 to 5 Business Days

<<<

, in order to harmonize the clauses between the Loans.

2.1. The 2012 Bond
For the 2012 Bond it is proposed that:
The Borrower and/or any subsidiary shall be entitled to issue short term debt with maturity

<<<

 on or before 31 July 2010.
The Bondholders grant a postponement of the payment if interest whereby the interest payment originally due on 2 May 2010 shall be paid on (Friday) 30 July 2010. No interest or late interest shall accrue on the interest

<<<

 amount for the period from 2 May 2010 until 30 July 2010. The ex date for the interest payment is 18 April 2010.
The Bondholders waive the default and cross default clauses to the extent that non-payment of the Interest payments in the 201

<<<

1 Bond and the 2012 Bond that were due on 2 May 2010 shall not constitute an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement for the 2012 Bond. The waiver expires 31 July 2010.
The notice period to summon a Bondholders' meeting shall be shortened

<<<

 from 10 Business Days to 5 Business Days, to match the notice period in the two other Loans. This will be achieved by amending Clause 16.2.4 first sentence to read "Summons to a Bondholders' Meeting shall be dispatched no later than 5 - five

<<<

 - Business Days prior to the Bondholders' Meeting."
3. The evaluation of the Loan Trustee
The Bondholders should note that the intention of the proposal is only to accommodate a solution, for the very short term, to the most immediate and most

<<<

 pressing financial problems of the Borrower. The Borrower will still have considerable challenges going forward, even in the short term.
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan

<<<

 Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether they find the Proposal acceptable.
