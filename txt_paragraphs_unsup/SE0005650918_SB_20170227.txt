1. Background
The market

<<<

 in which the Issuer operates is highly competitive. As previously announced, discussions have taken place regarding the Issuer's long term financing. The discussions have resulted in a proposed restructuring of the Issuer's ownership and financing

<<<

 structure. Several possibilities have been considered by the Issuer, its shareholder Off The Shelf 10012 AB (a company wholly owned by the CEO Dani Evanoff) (together with Evanoff Group AB, another company wholly owned by Dani Evanoff, "Evanoff

<<<

') and the Committee, where the joint ambition has been to find a suitable long term solution, which creates a stronger Company and which also aims to maximise bondholders' recovery.
As announced by way of press release on 17 February 2017,

<<<

 Goldcup 14280 AB ("Cloetta"), a company wholly owned by Cloetta AB (publ), has agreed with Evanoff and the Committee to acquire all shares and all other securities and instruments in the Issuer, including the Bonds (the "Transaction"). Cloetta

<<<

's obligations in connection with the Transaction have been guaranteed by Cloetta AB (publ). The Transaction is expected to create substantial synergies and strengthen the Issuer's position on the market. Cloetta, Evanoff and the Committee have

<<<

 entered into a share purchase agreement (the "SPA"). However, closing of the Transaction ("Closing") is conditional upon that the Holders and the Competition Authority (Sw. Konkurrensverket) approve the Transaction.
The majority of the purchase

<<<

 price will be allocated to the Holders. In the SPA, the enterprise value of the Issuer has been determined to SEK 325,000,000, which price is subject to adjustment depending on the difference between the estimated and the actual net debt and

<<<

 net working capital of the Issuer as at Closing. At signing of the SPA, the purchase price for the shares and the Bonds after such adjustment and after a minus adjustment for SEK 5,000,000 which Evanoff is entitled to separately according to

<<<

 the SPA was estimated to SEK 306,638,000. Out of the estimated amount of SEK 306,638,000, the Earn-out Instrumentholders (as defined below) would be entitled to 97 per cent. (SEK 297,438,860) (subject to the conditions set out in this Notice

<<<

), whereas Evanoff would be entitled to the remaining part. In addition to this, Cloetta has offered a potential earn-out payment in the amount of maximum SEK 225,000,000, of which the Earn-out Instrumentholders (as defined below) will be entitled

<<<

 to maximum SEK 218,250,000, based on the result of the Issuer's and the Cloetta group's combined sales volume of pick and mix in confectionary and natural snacks in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, United Kingdom, Poland and the Baltics during

<<<

 2018 (as further described in this Notice).
According to the SPA, the Bonds will be paid by way of an earn-out instrument to be issued by Cloetta (the "Earn-out Instrument") in exchange for Bonds and for the purpose of constituting a payment

<<<

 mechanism, in accordance with the terms and conditions for the Earn-out Instrument, the agreed draft terms attached hereto as Schedule 3 (the "Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions"). The holders of the Earn-out Instruments (the "Earn-out

<<<

 Instrumentholders") will be entitled to (i) an Initial Cash Payment (as defined below) which is estimated to be paid in connection
2 (17)

with Closing during the second or third quarter of 2017 (depending on Competition Authority's approval

<<<

 of the Transaction) and (ii) a potential Earn-out Payment (as defined below) which is estimated to be paid during the first or second quarter of 2019.
2. Proposals
2.1 The Earn-out Instrument and the exchange of Bonds for Earn-out Instruments

<<<


2.1.1 The Mandatory Securities Exchange and the Earn-out Instrument proposals
It is proposed that the Holders approve a mandatory securities exchange, whereby each Bond will be exchanged into a new Earn-out Instrument to be issued by Cloetta

<<<

 (the "Mandatory Securities Exchange"). If the Mandatory Securities Exchange is approved by the Holders, each Holder registered in the debt register (Sw. skuldbok) kept by the CSD on the applicable record date, will automatically be transferred

<<<

 a number of Earn out Instruments corresponding to the number of Bonds held by such Holder at that date (i.e. one Bond entitles to one Earn-out Instrument). The Bonds held by such Holder will be deducted from the Holder's securities account

<<<

 and transferred to Cloetta. The Mandatory Securities Exchange will (if approved by the Holders) take place at Closing, or as soon as practically possible after Closing, and the applicable record date for the Mandatory Securities Exchange will

<<<

 be communicated to the Holders by way of press release, notice on the Agent's and the Issuer's website and by regular mail.
The aggregate amount of the Earn-out Instruments will be SEK 218,250,000 and each Earn-out Instrument shall have a nominal

<<<

 amount of SEK 291,000, however subject to adjustment downwards as described under item (ii) below. The downward adjustment may result in the Earn-out Instruments being redeemed in an aggregate amount of SEK 0. The Earn-out Instruments will

<<<

 not be listed and will not bear any interest. The Earn out Instrument will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Cloetta's parent company Cloetta AB (publ), in accordance with the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions.
The Holders

<<<

 (as defined in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions) of Earn-out Instruments will be entitled to:
(i) An initial cash payment of SEK 297,438,860, i.e. SEK 396,585 per Earn-out Instrument (or a lower or higher amount depending on the

<<<

 difference between the estimated and the actual net debt and net working capital of the Issuer as at Closing, in accordance with the Purchase Price Adjustment as defined in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions) (the "Initial Cash Payment

<<<

"); and
(ii) Payment of the nominal amount of SEK 218,250,000, i.e. SEK 291,000 per Earn-out Instrument, or a reduction thereof (possibly resulting in an amount of SEK 0) subject to adjustments based on the sold volumes of pick and mix confectionary

<<<

 and natural snack as further described below (the "Earn-out Payment").
The final amounts of the Initial Cash Payment and the potential Earn-out Payment will be proposed by Cloetta by presenting Cloetta's calculation of the payments to be made

<<<

 to the Holders' Representatives (as defined below), after adjustments and deductions of any costs and expenses incurred due to actions initiated by the Earn-out
3 (17)

Instrumentholders. The Holders' Representatives may then accept or object

<<<

 to Cloetta's proposal. In case Cloetta and the Holders' Representatives don't reach an agreement, the matter may be referred to a third party auditor.
The Initial Cash Payment shall be payable as soon as practically possible after the Purchase

<<<

 Price Adjustment Approval Date (as defined in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions), which is the date when the purchase price adjustment has been finally determined in accordance with the SPA as reflected in the Earn-out Instrument

<<<

 Terms and Conditions and which is estimated to take place in close conjunction after Closing, in the second or third quarter of 2017. An amount corresponding to the preliminary Initial Cash Payment amount will upon Closing be paid to an escrow

<<<

 account, pledged in favour of inter alios the agent under the Earn-out Instrument on behalf of the holders of Earn-out Instruments. Any costs and expenses relating to the representation of the Agent under the Earn-out Instruments in relation

<<<

 to the escrow agreement shall be deducted from the Initial Cash Payment or the Earn-out Payment (as applicable).
The potential Earn-out Payment shall be payable on the Final Redemption Date (as defined in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions

<<<

) which is estimated to be at the latest on 30 April 2019, or such earlier date which occurs ten business days after the Earn-out Payment Approval Date (as defined in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions), which is the date when the

<<<

 Earn-out Payment has been finally determined in accordance with the SPA as reflected in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions. However, if the Earn-out Payment Approval Date has not occurred on 30 April 2019, Cloetta and the Agent under

<<<

 the Earn-out Instruments (acting on instruction of the Holders' Representatives) shall decide on a new possible Final Redemption Date.
The Earn-out Payment is based on the result of the Issuer's (including subsidiaries) and Cloetta AB (publ

<<<

)'s (including subsidiaries) combined sales volume of pick and mix in confectionary and natural snacks in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, United Kingdom, Poland and the Baltics during 2018. In order to obtain the full Earn-out Payment, the

<<<

 sold volumes during 2018 must amount to at least 109 per cent. of the Issuer's (including subsidiaries) and Cloetta AB (publ)'s (including subsidiaries) combined sales volume of pick and mix in confectionary and natural snacks in Sweden, Norway

<<<

, Denmark, Finland, United Kingdom, Poland and the Baltics during 2016. If the combined sales volume during 2018 amounts to less than 75 per cent. of the combined sales volume during 2016, no Earn-out Payment will be paid. If the combined sales

<<<

 volume during 2018 is in between 75 and 109 per cent. of the combined sales volume during 2016, the Earn-out Payment will be an amount between SEK 0 and 218,250,000, as calculated in accordance with the provisions set out in the Earn-out Instrument

<<<

 Terms and Conditions. In case, due to competition reasons, the Issuer's Swedish business is not transferred to Cloetta, this will not affect the amount of the Earn-out Payment, but the volumes derived from the Swedish business of both the Issuer

<<<

 (including subsidiaries) and Cloetta AB (publ) (including subsidiaries) will be deducted when calculating the combined sales volumes and the sales targets to be achieved.
The payments will be made through the CSD's account based system to each

<<<

 Holder (as defined in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions) of Earn-out Instruments registered in the debt register (Sw. skuldbok) kept by the CSD on the applicable record date. The Earn-out Instrumentholders will be given notice, in

<<<

 accordance with the Earn out Instrument Terms and Conditions, before such payments will be made.
4 (17)

All definitions relevant for the Initial Cash Payment and the potential Eam-out Payment have been agreed in the SPA and are also included

<<<

 in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions. The draft version of the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions, including further information on how the calculations and payments of the Initial Cash Payment and the potential Earn-out Payment

<<<

 are to be made, is attached hereto as Schedule 3. The draft Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions attached hereto may however be subject to amendments of technical or practical nature, however not affecting the commercial terms of the Earn

<<<

-out Instrument in a detrimental way for the Earn-out Instrumentholders, to be resolved upon by the Holders' Representatives (as defined below).
If deemed necessary by the Issuer or the Committee, further information in relation to how and when

<<<

 the Mandatory Securities Exchange (if approved by the Holders) will be effectuated will be distributed to the Holders.
2.1.2 Tax consequences due to the Mandatory Securities Exchange
The following summary of certain tax considerations that

<<<

 may arise as a result of the Mandatory Securities Exchange is based on current Swedish tax law and is intended only as general information. The tax consequences outlined below are based on an assessment obtained from an external tax adviser

<<<

. However it cannot be excluded that the Swedish Tax Agency may have a different view of the tax consequences of the Mandatory Securities Exchange. It is therefore recommended that each bondholder openly discloses the facts and circumstances

<<<

 of the Mandatory Securities Exchange in its income tax return to avoid any potential tax surcharges and penalties.
The Mandatory Securities Exchange should be viewed as a disposal under Swedish tax law. As such, each bondholder should report

<<<

 a loss or a gain related to the disposal, depending on the value of the Bond at the date of the acquisition. As the consideration for the disposal of the Bonds is made in two separate instalments (i. e. the Initial Cash Payment and the Earn

<<<

-out Payment), the final amount of losses or gains will vary dependant on the final amount paid. Thereto, any accrued interest on the Bonds may have to be taken into consideration when calculating potential capital gains or losses. Whether or

<<<

 not such loss would be deductible for tax purposes or if the gains would be taxable depends on the tax profile of each individual bondholder. In case the Bonds are disposed by a Swedish limited liability company or by an individual with tax

<<<

 residency in Sweden, any losses should be fully deductible for Swedish tax purposes whereas any gains should be fully taxable.
Tax implications, such as whether any capital gains would be taxable or any losses would be deductible, for bondholders

<<<

 who are not tax resident in Sweden should be confirmed by such bondholders prior to implementation.
In addition, the tax consequences for the bondholders may vary from the above as a result of the Earn-out Instrument (contrary to the Bond)

<<<

 not being a listed instrument. Any bondholder holding Bonds on an investment savings account (Sw. investerings sparkonto) is therefore recommended to consult a tax adviser.
Each bondholder must make its own determination as to the tax consequences

<<<

 of the Mandatory Securities Exchange and is recommended to consult a tax adviser for information with respect to the special tax consequences that may arise in each individual case, including the applicability and effect of foreign income tax

<<<

 rules,
5 (17)

provisions contained in double taxation treaties and other rules, which may be applicable.
2.1.3 Risk factors due to the Mandatory Securities Exchange
The Mandatory Securities Exchange and the Earn-out Instrument involve a number

<<<

 of inherent risks and below is a non-exhaustive list of certain risk factors that should be carefully reviewed by the Holders before voting in the Written Procedure. If any of these or other risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the development

<<<

 of the market for pick and mix confectionary and natural snack as well as the business, operating results and financial conditions of the Issuer and/or Cloetta, as issuer of the Earn-out Instrument, could be materially and adversely affected

<<<

, which could have a material adverse effect on e.g. the Earn-out Instrumentholders' chances to receive payments in accordance with the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions.
· Payment of the Initial Cash Payment is dependent upon the Purchase

<<<

 Price Adjustment (as defined in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions), which is calculated based on the difference between the estimated and the actual net debt and net working capital o f the Issuer as at Closing. This is in turn dependent

<<<

 upon several factors, some o f which are outside of the Issuer's control, such as the development of the market for pick and mix confectionary and natural snacks, any costs and expenses incurred which shall be deducted from the Initial Cash

<<<

 Payment or that the estimated figures for other reasons prove to be wrong. If any of these uncertainties where to develop in a negative way, there is a risk that the Initial Cash Payment will be significantly lower than SEK 297,438,860, which

<<<

 could also adversely affect the value of the Earn-out Instruments.
· Payment o f the Earn-out Payment is dependent upon the volumes of pick and mix confectionary and natural snacks sold during 2018. The volumes sold is in turn dependent upon

<<<

 several factors, some of which are outside of the Issuer's and Cloetta's control, such as the development of the market for pick and mix confectionary and natural snacks, the integration of the Issuer into Cloetta's business, any costs and

<<<

 expenses incurred which shall be deducted from the Earn-out Payment (in accordance with the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions) or that the agreed volumes are for other reasons not reached. Further, the Earn-out Payment amount will be

<<<

 proposed by Cloetta and shall be finally agreed by the Holders' Representatives. If no Holders' Representatives exist by year-end 2018 and if no new members are elected in due time, Cloetta's calculation of the Earn-out Payment amount will

<<<

 apply. If any of these uncertainties where to develop in a negative way, there is a risk that the Earn out Payment amount will amount to less than SEK 218,250,000 or will amount to SEK 0, which could also adversely affect the value o f the

<<<

 Earn-out Instruments.
· The appointment o f Holders' Representatives (as defined below and if approved by the Holders) will result in the Holders' Representatives having a wide mandate to take decisions which will be binding upon all Holders

<<<

 and Earn-out Instrumentholders (as applicable). Consequently, the actions of the Holders' Representatives could impact a Holders' or Earn-out Instrumentholders' rights (as applicable) in a manner that could be undesirable for some Holders or

<<<

 Earn out Instrumentholders (as applicable).
6 (17)

· The Eam-out Instrument is unsecured and the Mandatory Securities Exchange carries a credit risk relating to Cloetta's ability to meet its payment obligations under the Earn-out Instrument

<<<

 Terms and Conditions. The credit risk would increase if the financial position of Cloetta and/or its subsidiaries would deteriorate. An increased credit risk could adversely affect the value of the Earn-out Instruments as well as Cloetta's

<<<

 possibility to make payments under the Earn-out Instruments as they fall due.
· Contrary to the Bond, the Earn-out Instrument does not entitle to interest payments and the Earn-out Instrumentholders are therefore not entitled to any continuous

<<<

 return. Any costs relating to the SPA or the Earn-out Instrument will, if due to actions initiated by the Holders or Earn-out Instrumentholders, be borne by the Earn-out Instrumentholders by way of reduction of the Initial Cash Payment or Earn

<<<

-out Payment (as applicable). However, if the Initial Cash Payment or Earn-out Payment (as applicable) does not cover such costs, the Holders or Earn-out Instrumentholders may, in accordance with the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions

<<<

, be required to issue an indemnity to Cloetta for such costs or otherwise finance such costs in order to being able to invoke their rights under the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions.
· The Earn-out Instruments received by the Holders

<<<

 by way of the proposed Mandatory Securities Exchange will not be listed. As a result of the Earn-out Instrument not being a listed instrument, tax consequences may arise and each Holder is therefore requested to carefully read Section 2.1.

<<<

2 on tax consequences due to the Mandatory Securities Exchange. Further, the issuer of the Earn-out Instruments will not be subject to disclosure requirements to the same extent as the Issuer. The only information that will be available regarding

<<<

 the value of the Earn-out Instrument will be Cloetta AB (publ)'s estimate of the fair value of the Earn-out Instrument based on IFRS and disclosed in Cloetta AB (publ)'s quarterly reports. Cloetta will also quarterly issue a compliance certificate

<<<

 to the agent under the Earn-out Instruments, in which Cloetta confirms (i) Cloetta AB (publ)'s estimated fair value of the Earn-out Instruments based on IFRS, (ii) that the estimated fair value was calculated in accordance with the SPA and

<<<

 (iii) that the estimated fair value has been reviewed and confirmed by an auditor. As a result o f the above, there is no guarantee that there will be any efficient trading in or pricing o f the Earn-out Instruments whatsoever.
2.2 Appointment

<<<

 of Holders' Representatives
It is proposed that the Holders appoint a group o f representatives for the Holders, consisting of three members initially being Peter Werleus (representing Norron AB), Carl-Fredrik Hogstedt (representing Skandia

<<<

 Fonder AB) and Thiemo Bischoff (representing Robus Capital Management Ltd) (the "Holders' Representatives"). The Holders' Representatives shall until Closing be unconditionally, irrevocably and exclusively fully authorised to take the necessary

<<<

 decisions required with binding effect on all o f the Holders, and shall after Closing be unconditionally, irrevocably and exclusively fully authorised to take the necessary decisions required with binding effect on all of the Earn-out Instrumentholders

<<<

, relating to the provisions set forth in the SPA which include inter alia to (i) consent to any disclosure or announcement, (ii) determine the Purchase Price Adjustment and the Earn-out Payment, (iii) giving, executing and delivering any waiver

<<<

 or consent under, or any amendment to the SPA, (iv) signing, executing and delivering any document and taking any action that may be necessary or
7 (17)

appropriate in connection with the SPA (including but not limited to any document to

<<<

 be signed, executed or delivered at the closing), and (v) agreeing, compromising and settling any claim. The Holders' Representatives' mandate is however in some respects limited, as set out in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions.

<<<

 Further, the Holders' Representatives shall always be able to instruct the Agent to initiate a Holder's Meeting or a Written Procedure if, in the Holders' Representatives opinion, the decision to be taken is more appropriate to be decided upon

<<<

 by such means.
All costs and expenses incurred by the Holders' Representatives and/or the Agent shall be paid by the Earn-out Instrumentholders, provided that such costs and expenses have arisen due to actions initiated by the Earn-out Instrumentholders

<<<

, and shall be paid by Cloetta if such actions have been initiated by Cloetta. Any costs and expenses incurred by the Earn-out Instrumentholders shall be invoiced to and paid by Cloetta and thereafter (to the extent the Earn-out Instrumentholders

<<<

 have initiated the action) reimbursed by the Earn-out Instrumentholders pro rata by way of deduction of the Initial Cash Payment or the Earn-out Payment (as applicable), provided however that in the event that no Earn-out Payment is payable

<<<

, and if any such costs that have not been deducted from the Initial Cash Payment, exceed SEK 100,000, Cloetta shall only be obligated to pay such costs above SEK 100,000 if indemnified by any of the Earn-out Instrumentholders or a party designated

<<<

 by the Earn-out Instrumentholders. In case such costs and/or expenses have been incurred prior to Closing, these will be taken into consideration when calculating the Purchase Price Adjustment (as defined in the Earn out Instrument Terms and

<<<

 Conditions).
It is further proposed that the Holders agree that the Holders' Representatives are fully discharged from any liability whatsoever when acting in accordance with this Section 2.2 and in accordance with the provisions set out in

<<<

 Clause 13 of the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions applied mutatis mutandis, provided that the Holders' Representatives have not acted with gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Holders' Representatives shall never be responsible

<<<

 for indirect loss.
Until Closing, the provisions relating to the Holders' Representatives as set out in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions, including the mandate, as well as quorum and decision procedures as set out in Clause 13 to

<<<

 the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions, shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Holders' Representatives under the Bonds (for the avoidance of doubt, the Holders' Representatives shall however not have any mandate to amend the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 for the Bonds). Thereafter the provisions set out in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions shall apply directly to the Holders' Representatives under the Earn-out Instrument.
2.3 Amendments and Waivers due to the Transaction
As previously

<<<

 announced by way of press release and in accordance with the SPA, Cloetta has agreed with Evanoff and the Committee to acquire all shares and all other securities and instruments in the Issuer. According to the Terms and Conditions, the occurrence

<<<

 of an event whereby (i) Dani Evanoff cease to control the Issuer or (ii) one or more persons, acting in concert, acquire control over the Issuer, constitutes a Change of Control Event. In accordance with Section 10.4 (Mandatory Repurchase due

<<<

 to a Change o f Control Event) of the Terms and Conditions, upon a Change of Control Event, each Holder has a right to request that all, or only some, of its Bonds are repurchased at a price per Bond equal to 101.00 per cent. of the Nominal

<<<

 Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. In order to finalise the Transaction, it is proposed that the Holders waive certain conditions in the Terms and Conditions to the
8 (17)

effect that the Transaction may be carried out without

<<<

 this constituting a Change of Control Event.
Since the Mandatory Securities Exchange (if approved by the Holders), will result in Cloetta being the sole holder of all outstanding Bonds, it is further proposed that the Holders approve to de

<<<

-list the Bonds and allow a Group Company or an Affiliate, being the sole owner of all outstanding Bonds, to take decisions in Bondholders' Meetings and Written Procedures. It is therefore further proposed that the Holders approve certain amendments

<<<

 to the Terms and Conditions, to the effect that certain definitions or provisions will no longer be related to Dani Evanoff or to the listing of the Bonds, and that the definition of Adjusted Nominal Amount and the provisions in Section 17

<<<

 (Decisions by Bondholders) are adjusted in order to enable a Group Company or an Affiliate, being the sole owner of all outstanding Bonds, to participate in decisions.
2.4 Release of Pledge
In connection with the transfer of instruments from

<<<

 the previous main shareholders to Evanoff, all shares and other securities and instruments in the Issuer and certain claims, directly or indirectly held by Dani Evanoff, were pledged in favour of the Holders (represented by the Agent), as security

<<<

 for the fulfilment of Evanoff s obligations in relation to the contemplated restructuring of the financing structure (the "Pledge"). The Holders are now requested to approve the release of the Pledge and to instruct the Agent to take any measures

<<<

 required to effectuate such release.
2.5 Miscellaneous
The Committee has communicated to the Agent that Holders representing approximately 80 per cent. of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount will vote in favour of the Request (as defined below

<<<

) and that representatives of the beneficial owners of these Bonds have entered into irrevocable undertakings to vote in favour of the Request (as defined below).
3. Request
In order to finalise the Transaction, the Holders are hereby requested

<<<

 to (i) waive certain terms of the Terms and Conditions in accordance with Section 3.1 below (the "Waivers"), (ii) agree to the Mandatory Securities Exchange in accordance with Section 3.2 below, (iii) appoint the Holders' Representatives in

<<<

 accordance with Section 3.3 below, (iv) agree to amend the Terms and Conditions as specified in Section 3.4 below (the "Amendments") and (v) agree to release the Pledge in accordance with Section 3.5 below (the "Release of Pledge").
The Amendments

<<<

 have been approved by the Issuer. The Waivers, the Mandatory Securities Exchange, the appointment of the Holders' Representatives, the Amendments and the Release of Pledge are jointly referred to as the "Request".
The Holders' approval of the

<<<

 Request shall constitute a required waiver in relation to any Event of Default or any breach of the Issuer's obligations under the Terms and Conditions, which could otherwise occur due to the implementation of the Request.
9 (17)

3.1 Waivers

<<<


The Holders are hereby requested to resolve as follows.
Regardless of what is stated in the Terms and Conditions, Evanoff shall be permitted to transfer all of Evanoff s shares and other securities and instruments in the Issuer to Cloetta,

<<<

 without this transaction constituting a Change of Control Event. For the avoidance of doubt, this transaction shall thus not lead to a right for the Holders to have their Bonds repurchased by the Issuer in accordance with Section 10.4 (Mandatory

<<<

 Repurchase due to a Change o f Control Event) of the Terms and Conditions or any other provision set forth in Section 10 (Redemption and Repurchase o f the Bonds).
3.2 Mandatory Securities Exchange
The Holders are hereby requested to approve

<<<

 the Mandatory Securities Exchange, whereby (if approved by the Holders) each Bond will be exchanged into a new Earn-out Instrument to be issued by Cloetta in connection with Closing and in accordance with the terms and conditions as set forth

<<<

 in the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions.
3.3 Appointment of Holders' Representatives
The Holders are hereby requested to, for the time from approval of the Request up until Closing, appoint Peter Werleus (representing Norron AB), Carl

<<<

-Fredrik Hogstedt (representing Skandia Fonder AB) and Thiemo Bischoff (representing Robus Capital Management Ltd) as Holders' Representatives with an unconditional, irrevocable and exclusive right to act with binding effect on all Holders in

<<<

 accordance with the provisions set out above in Section 2.2 and in Clause 13 or the Earn-out Instrument Terms and Conditions applied mutatis mutandis.
For the avoidance of doubt, after Closing, the Holders' Representatives shall continue to

<<<

 exist and to act on behalf of the Earn-out Instrumentholders.
3.4 Amendments
The Holders are hereby requested to approve the amendments to the Terms and Conditions set out below. In the below, blue and underlined text indicates additions whereas

<<<

 red and crossed-out text indicates removals.
1.1 Definitions
"Adjusted Nominal Amount" means the Total Nominal Amount less the Nominal Amount of all Bonds owned by a Group Company or an Affiliate, irrespective of whether such person is directly

<<<

 registered as owner of such Bonds, unless all outstanding Bonds are owned by such Group Company or Affiliate, in which case the Nominal Amount of these Bonds shall not be subtracted from the Total Nominal Amount when calculating the Adjusted

<<<

 Nominal Amount.
"Change of Control Event" means the occurrence of an event or series of events whereby (i) Dani EvanoffCloetta AB (publ) ceases to control the Issuer or (ii) one or more persons (not being an Affiliate of Cloetta AB (publ))

<<<

, acting in concert, acquire control over the Issuer.
10 (17)

(b)

Closing

 Net Debt

Note (1) Candyking has factoring arrangements, all sold invoices as per the Closing Date with a due date as per the underlying customer contract in force as at the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, not considering what is

<<<

 stated on the actual invoice or in any other invoicing or credit terms in any factoring/supply chain financing agreement) later than the Closing Date should be treated as debt. The factoring adjustment in the table above is illustrative and

<<<

 is based on a calculation on invoicing and credit terms of 46 days. As at Closing, an adjustment should be made, that reflects the creditor balance per customer as per the below example. Example: Customer 1 has credit days of 45 days in the

<<<

 underlying customer contract in force as at the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, not considering what is stated on the actual invoice or in any other invoicing or credit terms in any factoring agreement/supply chain financing agreement

<<<

), and the invoice is sold to a factoring company. At Closing all invoicing (including VAT and sugar tax) to Customer 1, 38 days (45 days minus 7 days due to the payment terms of the factoring agreement/supply chain financing agreement (as applicable

<<<

)) prior to Closing should be treated as debt, i.e. if Closing takes place on 30 June 2017, all sold invoices with invoicing date, post and including, 23 May 2017 should be treated as debt. However, always subject to that payment has been received

<<<

 for the sold invoice.

Note (2) Candyking has budgeted capex of SEK 2.54m per month for financial year 2017. To the extent that the Company has spent more (or less) than SEK 2.54m of capex per month during the period up to Closing with consistent

<<<

 accounting policy, the Net Debt at closing will be adjusted for any such deviation, positive or negative. SEK 7.8m estimates capex spend over budget as per 30 June 2017. Example: if Candyking booked capex of SEK 23.0m, irrespective of whether

<<<

 paid or not, in the first six months of 2017 (2017-01-01 to 2017-06-30) and the budgeted capex is SEK 15.24m (6*SEK 2.54m), the Net Debt will be adjusted with +SEK 7.8m. For the avoidance of doubt, capex that has been booked but not yet paid

<<<

 will still be taken into account in the capex Net Debt adjustment.

Note (3) In the event that the PostNord claim amounting to SEK 242,000 has not been paid, settled or withdrawn prior to the Closing Date, the SEK 242,000 claim shall be treated

<<<

 as a debt item.

Schedule 3(viii) Net Working Capital

The below line items should be used to calculate the Net Working Capital position as at the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, normalisation adjustments and inventory adjustment

<<<

 should not be included in the line items used to calculate Closing Net Working Capital or Preliminary Net Working Capital.
The calculation for determining the Preliminary Purchase Price, shall be calculated in accordance with the following
