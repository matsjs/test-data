1 COMPANY UPDATE
All the business areas in the Issuer's group (the "Group") have to an extent been affected by the general decline in the oil industry. The Group has in 2015 worked with

<<<

 rationalization and restructuring, for adaptation to the new situation. Market trends and expectations for continued lower demand have resulted in the Group implementing several measures, including reduction o f workforce by --100 full-time

<<<

 employees.
The Group has traditionally constructed offshore vessels, and this is an important part of the future as well. The offshore segment is dependent on the oil price level and the investment level in the oil sector. The oil price has

<<<

 declined significantly since the last half of 2014, and this has brought uncertainty to this market and investment decisions are postponed. The demand for offshore vessels has been affected by this, and 2016 is going to be a challenging year

<<<

 in this sector.

The Group has had a diversification strategy for the last years, and this has resulted in a diversified customer base in several segments. This should

<<<

 make the Group well prepared to meet the challenges in the offshore market:
· Established in the growing windmill service ship market with new and proven design · Leading provider of Ice-breaker vessels · Established position in the aquaculture

<<<

 market with new technology, both for construction of live-
fish carriers and delivery of design and equipment packages
The Group's order backlog per 30 March 2016 is NOK 1.8 billion, and includes five newbuilds from the yard, various design

<<<

 contracts, after-sales activity and supply of equipment and systems for fish handling.

2 BACKGROUND, SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND EXCHANGE OFFER
2.1 Background The Issuer has in recent years been successful in expanding business into offshore wind, aquaculture and fishing. This transforming

<<<

 has been costly, but has laid the foundation for the way forward and for the Issuer to be positioned for a market recovery. The Issuer currently has a backlog of 4 vessels for delivery the next 11 months, whereof all vessels are repeat vessels

<<<

 and expected to show healthy returns, while the construction of a 5th vessel (Project A) is currently put on hold. Securing new contracts for the yard is key and o f highest priority of the management to maintain and increase level o f operations

<<<

 in the Group.
The Issuer has focus on the liquidity situation which has been negatively affected by negative results in 2015 and funds tied up in three newbuildings:
· Project A: Postponed - ties up approximately NOK 50 million · Project B

<<<

 & C: Until today these projects have been financed by payments from the customer, but
with remaining payments being tail heavy, financing from the Issuer is required for completion
The following arrangements are being put in place to meet liquidity

<<<

 challenges related to Project B & C:
· Vendor financing for certain equipment · Process with relationship bank to provide financing for remaining uncovered construction cost
An amendment of the terms of HYARD01 as requested is expected to give

<<<

 the following effects:
· enable the required construction financing for Project B & C · ensure that Havyard can draw on existing construction loans as well as secure new construction
financing, thereby being in a position to secure new business

<<<

 · secure a sufficient headroom for Havyard's working capital covenants
