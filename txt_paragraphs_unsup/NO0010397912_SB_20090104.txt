Oslo, 24 March 2009
Amendments to the Loan Agreement - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"/ "Norsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bonds") in the above-mentioned loan (the "Loan

<<<

") where Hansa Property Group ASA ("HPRO"/ the "Company") is the borrower.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement dated 15th November 2007 (the "Loan Agreement") or the summons to this

<<<

 Bondholders' Meeting unless otherwise stated.
The information in this summons regarding the Company and market conditions are provided by the Company and NTM expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND

<<<


See the enclosed letter from the Company for an overview of the history and background for the amendment proposal to be presented to the Bondholders in this summons, the current financial position and an overview of the debts together with

<<<

 a description of the main elements of the Company's restructuring plan.

2. THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT

<<<

 following permanent amendments to the Loan Agreement (together the "Proposal"), see below:

a. MARGIN: The Company proposes to decrease the Margin set out in the Loan Agreement from 4.00 percentage points to 2.00 percentage points per anno

<<<

.

N O R SK TILLITSM A N N ASA

HPRO is, according to the Company, unable to exercise the Call Option in the Loan Agreement (cf. Clause 10), together with that the hibernation

<<<

 scenario probably will not bring any Excess Cash and if any sale of property or land is carried out before the Maturity Date, HPRO will, according to the Company, need the cash to its running operations and investments. Using Excess Cash as

<<<

 set in the Loan Agreement will according to the Board of Directors of the Company simply make HPRO unable to generate any cash from operations taken today's financial market into account.

ii.

TOTAL DEBT TO MARKET VALUE COVENANT: The Company

<<<

 proposes to set

aside the financial covenant in the Loan Agreement procuring that the Total Debt to

Market Value not exceeds 70% (as defined therein).

iii.

EQUITY RATIO: The Company proposes to set aside the current Equity Ratio

requirement

<<<

 as set out in the Loan Agreement.

d. EVENT OF DEFA ULT CLA USE: The Company proposes to amend the Event of Default Clause 15.1 c), d), e) and f) and to replace it with the following clauses:
c) if fo r the Borrower or each o f the Guarantors

<<<

, anyfinancial indebtedness o f or guaranteed hy, is not paid when due within applicable grace period or is cancelled, suspended or becomes due prior to the maturity date due to an event o f default;
d) i f bankruptcy proceedings are opened

<<<

 in the Borrower or a Guarantor, or the Borrower or a Guarantor files fo r debt negotiations proceedings according to the Bankruptcy Act, declares a suspension o fpayments or declares to be insolvent;
e) if any representation or statement made

<<<

 by the Borrower in the Finance Documents or any other document delivered by or on behalfo f any Borrower under or in connection with any Finance Document is or proves to have need incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or

<<<

 deemed to be made
Pursuant to the Company, the reason for requesting the above changes to the Event of Default Clause 15.1 (new c), d) and e) see above) is that these provisions, together with the unchanged Clause 15.1 a) and b), are the standard

<<<

 provisions agreed with the other financial creditors for the restructuring of the Company.
e. WAIVER: The Company proposes that the Bondholders waive its rights in the Loan Agreement to declare an Event of Default in the period until 30 June

<<<

 2009 based on the action taken by the Group in connection with the execution of the restructuring plan as described in the letter from HPRO as attached to this summons (the "Restructuring Plan") or it becomes evident that the Restructuring

<<<

 Plan will not implemented.
f. CONDITIONS: The Proposal is subject to:
i. the Company raising minimum NOK 250 million in new capital in an equity issue before 30 June 2009 (the "Restructuring Date"). (Certain major shareholders may be granted

<<<

 delayed settlement for part of the new shares subscribed in the equity issue);
ii. that the General Meeting of the shareholders of HPRO make the required decisions to implement the Restructuring Plan;

-2 -

N O RSK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA

<<<



iii. that the Restructuring Plan is approved by all the financial creditors of the Group;
iv. that no new information is disclosed before the Restructuring Date resulting in a major adverse change in the premises on which the Restructuring

<<<

 Plan is based upon,
v. The Restructuring Plan shall be executed and finalized in its entirety no later than 30 June 2009.

3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
NTM's evaluation
The Loan Trustee presupposes that the Bondholders are familiar

<<<

 with the stressed situation of HPRO through its financial reporting and as further outlined by the Company in the information meeting of the Bondholders on 23 February 2009, as well as set out in this summons. Pursuant to the Company, the current

<<<

 cash situation is critical for the Company and its stakeholders. The presented Restructuring Plan by the Company will, according to the Company, provide the Company with necessary funding through a two years hibernation scenario. The only alternative

<<<

 to the Restructuring Plan is likely to be a winding-up of the Company with a disposal of the Company's assets in the present market. The Company's hibernation strategy is based upon a market upturn in 2011-2012, and for bondholders agreeing

<<<

 to the expectation of this market upturn, the Company's proposal seems sensible. In today's challenging markets, it is the Company's opinion that there is not possible to raise the necessary equity for the Restructuring Plan, and at the same

<<<

 time put in place equity instruments in favor of the Bondholders.
The Bondholders are requested to thoroughly evaluate whether the Proposal, based on the situation, and an assessment of the proposed changes, should be accepted. The request

<<<

 is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation from the Loan Trustee.
It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their tax advisors, legal advisors, financial advisors or other advisors regarding the effect of the

<<<

 proposed changes. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has challenges going forward and the Company might be unable to meet its commitments in the future.

HANSA
PROPERTY V
To The owners, creditors and investors in Hansa Property Group AS

Dale: March 23,2009

Restructuring Hansa Property Group AS (HPRO)
1. History
HPRO was established by Pareto Equity AS the Summer

<<<

 of 2007 with the purpose of gathering several portfolios for property development in Norway, Scandinavia and the Baltic Countries (traditionally named the Hansa region), and establish a large leading property developer with a tradable share

<<<

. According to this original plan HPRO would be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in the first half of 2008,
After negotiations HPRO acquired 4 larger property portfolios in Norway, November 2007. These were Kaldnes Brygge in Tønsberg, Skårersletta

<<<

 at Lørenskog, Bo EN AS with several centrally located projects in Stavanger and a portfolio in the Bergen area counting a variety of residential projects. The portfolios were in different developmental stages from initiated building processes

<<<

 to options to buy land. Former owners were paid partly in cash and partly in HPRO shares. As part of the establishment process NOK 400 million were issued in Callable Bonds, and a N O K 160 million mortgage was signed with DnB (details below

<<<

).
Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) were contracted as Management for Hire, and the building of an organization began with the signing of key personnel.
As market conditions changed the stock exchange introduction was postponed, and HPRO executed

<<<

 in its place a 150 million Rights issue in the spring of 2008. Parallel to this an agreement was signed with Selvaag Bolig As giving HPRO a majority stake (70%) in a large property development portfolio in the greater Oslo region. As part of

<<<

 this settlement HPRO earned an additional cash influx of NOK 75 million, and a sales credit, see below.
Enclosed is an overview of the Corporations legal structure (attachment 1), and a short overview of projects and property portfolios (attachment

<<<

 2 ).

2. Background and the purpose behind restructuring
After the establishment of HPRO the

<<<

 property market has taken a harsh downturn, especially visible in the residential segment. This was part of the reasoning behind postponing the planned Stock Exhange listing. In its place capita! was raised from existing shareholders through

<<<

 a rights issue. As part of the transaction the parties were informed that without the realization of assets or initiation of projects, HPRO would - through fulfillment of contractual engagements - run out of liquid funds in the first half of

<<<

 2009.
Since the summer of 2008 there has been a reinforcement of the negative market development. Buyers of newly built residents are few and far between, as are buyers of land for development, Another factor is the very difficult market for

<<<

 finance leaving a restrictive attitude of finance institutions towards funding new projects, even ones with long secure rental contracts.
This has led to a devaluation of the portfolios and a re-evaluation of the implementation pace on projects

<<<

. This again necessitates new thinking around the company's financial obligations. HPRO will need additional capital for the continuous running of operations and to secure existing values in anticipation of the return of a healthier market.

<<<

 For the same reason HPRO went from ASA (public Ltd) to AS (Ltd,) in December 2008 and share value was written down from NOK 25,- per share to NOK 1,- per share.
The Board resolved in the Autumn of 2008 to restructure the corporation with the

<<<

 objective of freeing up necessary capital and ensure the financial drive to serve debts and operational costs for a defined period running until Q3 2011, without depending on cash flow or the sale/realization of new projects. The values could

<<<

 then be sustained or built upon until a more normal market returns. This would ensure concentration, flexibility and predictability with HPRO, owners and creditors for an extended period. Without such a plan HPRO will, in keeping with contractual

<<<

 claims, run out of cash by March 2009.
As soon as acceptable market conditions occur HPRO will seek to start projects to create values.
Throughout the restructuring process HPRO has kept its creditors informed, and there has been no payment

<<<

 of debts apart from operational costs. One installment to DnBNOR of NOK 25 million has been placed on a separate bank account as the restructuring work has been done.
HPRO has engaged att. at law Leif Petter Madsen and more at the iawfirm Wikborg

<<<

 & Rein to assist in this process.

3. Overview of debts and main securities before restructuring

HPRO today has a total long term debt of approx. MNOK 2 011 as shown below. The debt has been ranged based on our assumptions on the creditors

<<<

' securities, starting with the strongest security in the present market.

Banks with first priority security in property/land: DnB Nor loan to HPG Øst AS, pledge in shares

MNOK 1154 MNOK 160

MNOK 176.6 MNOK 400 MNOK 221

4, Separate elements of the restructuring

<<<

 process
4.1 Cost reduction
After the November 2007 takeover of the portfolios, PwC was contracted as interim management at the same time as key personnel was hired for HPRO. Simultanously management agreements were signed with Sjølyst Utvikling

<<<

 AS for property development, Veidekke for accounting and Grant Management for supervising of the portfolios at Lørenskog and Kaldnes, respectively. All of these contracts have been terminated and provides significant cost reductions.
Furthermore

<<<

 there were changes made in corporate management in the autumn of 2008 that also provided cost savings.
Layoffs have been made in Stavanger, and corporate activity levels have stabilized on the minimum required to pay interests and operate in

<<<

 a way that secures the value of assets, including regulatory processes in preparation for launching in better market conditions.
All cost reductions are done,
4.2 Previous ow ners of the Stavanger portfolio
Rotac AS, TS Maskin AS, Svithun Finans

<<<

 AS og Masiv AS (sellers) sold the Stavanger portfolio to HPRO in November 2007. According to contract the sellers have a claim towards HPRO for the rest of the purchase amount; MNOK 221 payable at 1) MNOK 143 the regulation of Jaasund and 

<<<

2) M N O K at the 78 at the regulation of Aase Gaard.This was an unsecured sales credit. Jaasund was regulated in February 2009 and Aase Gaard is expected to be regulated by November 2009. HPRO gave early notice to the sellers that there were

<<<

 no liquid funds to cover the installments at the agreed deadline,
After negotiations the sellers and HPRO have agreed on the following terms to a settlement:
S Signing of 496 000 shares in HPRO at NOK 25,- per share, equaling MNOK 12,4. After

<<<


signing, the Sellers will hold 5% of the shares in HPRO, before the equity issue launch.
S Cash payment of NOK 25 million. The Sellers are here obliged to sign for 5% in the equity
issue.
2 Sales credit of NOK 10 million. This credit will have

<<<

 2. priority in property belonging to Aase Gaard AS, have an interest rating of 2,5% and is due for payment when Aase Gaard is sold to a third party. (The credit will thus not affect cash flow).

S Acquisition of 37,5% of shares in Bo EN AS

<<<

. The purchase name the value of the shares in Bo
EN AS to NOK 174 millions. Book value is N O K 115 millions.
The settlement includes a reduction for HPRO at NOK 58,8 millions in relation to book value.
The parties agree on the terms and the

<<<

 agreement will be signed within March 26th.
4.3 Dul! Nor
DnB holds before the restructuring the following engagements relating to the property portfolio organized in HPG Øst AS:
S A loan to HPG Øst AS of MNOK 160 given when HPRO was established

<<<

. The loan is secured
with a guarantee attached to HPRO, 1. priority pledge in the shares of HPG Øst AS, BoEN AS and Sjølyst Eiendom AS, as well as a negative pledge term. The installments to the loan are due twice a year with MNOK 25, first

<<<

 time November 2008. Final installment to be paid August 1st 2010, Capital is not to be taken past HPG Øst AS before a minimum of M NOK 100 is paid.

<<<

S Different collected loans for land purchase in Kaldnes Byutvikling AS at a total of M NOK
92,5, Loans are agreed to be deducted with NOK 

<<<

1500 per realized square meter. The loans in total are due in a period from June 1st 2010 until January 1st 2011,
Margins in general are from 75 to 145 points above NIBOR.
HPRO and DnB Nor have agreed that after the restructuring the terms will

<<<

 be these:
S The loan to HPG Øst will not be deducted until 31.12.2011, at which point HPRO will start
paying half yearly installments of MNOK 25, Final payment is fixed at December 31st 2013. The only terms under which deductions will happen

<<<

 in this period are if realizations bring valid funds to HPG Øst as, and after debts are remunerated where realization happens. In the case of such realizations 80% will go to down payments and 20% are to be freely used within the HPG Øst AS

<<<

 organization for operations and development.
S DnB Nor relent their pledge for 40% of the shares in BoEn AS. Installment set on bank
account in November 2008 is to be returned to HPRO.

<<<

 and are to be deducted for if
realization occurs in K1 or K2. The loans will run until December 31st 2013.

realized square meter, with an added 50% of excess

<<<

 until the M NOK 123 related to K1 is fully paid.

The final agreement

<<<

 with DnBNOR is targeted to be settled within March 27th.
4.4 Selvaag Bolig AS
After the acquisition of the Selvaag portfolio in summer 2008 50% of the purchase price was paid in HPRO shares. The remaining 50%, NOK 176,6 million is a sales credit

<<<

. The term for this credit is to pay installments as building starts on each part of the projects. The interest of the credit is NIBOR + 275 points. There is agreed a last due date of 18 months after estimated construction start on the separate

<<<

 projects. This means HPRO will have to settle the amount for each project even though building has not commenced. In the current market, where all project starts are postponed, this infers a substantial cash strain on HPRO, where first payments

<<<

 are due from 2010.
The credit is secured as a first priority pledge in HRPOs shares in the separate project companies, as well as a second priority pledge in the properties (after DnB Nor/Handelsbanken with MNOK 504,5).
An additional agreement

<<<

 has been signed where the parties agree on the following permanent changes:

 date 18 months after estimated construction start is removed
The same agreement incorporates temporary changes: For projects started before December 31st 2011 down payments will only be made when any projects or parts thereof are completed

<<<

. For projects started after January 1st 2012 the term will again be that part payment is due as construction starts on the separate projects.
The terms ofthe settlement are agreed between the parties and will be signed within March 26th.

<<<

 same companies.
HPRO has suggested to the Bondholders through the Loan Trustee that the maturity date is increased by at least 2 years, and that the coupon is reduced to NIBOR + 200 points. Additionally HPRO has asked that all financial covenants

<<<

The group's Q4 2008 financial statements have not been prepared as of date. Following the Q3 2008 unaudited accounts that was released in December 20

<<<

08, the group would like to call the attention to the following material transactions/events and their potential effect on the group's financial statements;

1. The write-down exercise related to the value of the land and property projects

<<<

 will be made according to IFRS 2. As of date the amount to be written down has increased from the indicated level of NOK 700 mill to a level of NOK 825 mill, factoring iii a positive effect related to the reversal of earn out estimates for

<<<

 the projects being written-down. The NOK 825 mill amount includes a materia! write down of prior capitalized project and land cost, reflecting that projects are being postponed and to a certain degree the need for revising prior plans.
2. Interest

<<<

 rate swaps. The group will record an unrealized loss related to interest swaps of NOK 25 mill at yearend, 3. Running cost and borrowing cost for the 4th quarter of 2008 will be charged to the profit and loss statement at yearend. 4. The company

<<<

 has reached an agreement in relation to a sellers' credit that originates from a transaction whereby the group acquired land and
projects in the Stavanger region in November 2007.Following the settlement of this credit, NOK 221 in total, the

<<<

 group is likely to record a gain of NOK 58 mill in Q2 2009 having a similar positive effect on the book value of the group's equity.

 ASA

HPRO is, according to the Company, unable to exercise the Call Option in the Loan Agreement (cf. Clause 10), together with that the hibernation scenario probably will not bring any Excess Cash and if any sale of property or land is carried

<<<

 out before the Maturity Date, HPRO will, according to the Company, need the cash to its running operations and investments. Using Excess Cash as set in the Loan Agreement will according to the Board of Directors of the Company simply make HPRO

<<<

 unable to generate any cash from operations taken today's financial market into account.

ii.

TOTAL DEBT TO MARKET VAL VE CO VENANT: The Company proposes to set

aside the financial covenant in the Loan Agreement procuring that the Total Debt

<<<

d. EVENT OF DEFA ULT CLA USE: The Company proposes to amend

<<<

 the Event of Default Clause 15.1 c), d), e) and f) and to replace it with the following clauses:
c) if, fo r the Borrower or each o f the Guarantors, anyfinancial indebtedness o f or guaranteed by, is not p aid when due within applicable grace

<<<

 under or in connection with any Finance Document is or proves to have need incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be made
Pursuant to the Company, the reason for requesting the above changes to the Event of Default

<<<

 Clause 15.1 (new c), d) and e) see above) is that these provisions, together with the unchanged Clause 15.1 a) and b), are the standard provisions agreed with the other financial creditors for the restructuring of the Company.
e. WAIVER: The

<<<

 Company proposes that the Bondholders waive its rights in the Loan Agreement to declare an Event of Default in the period until 30 June 2009 based on the action taken by the Group in connection with the execution of the restructuring plan as

 is disclosed before the Restructuring Date resulting in a major adverse change in the premises on which the Restructuring Plan is based upon,
v. The Restructuring Plan shall be executed and finalized in its entirety no later than 30 June 2

<<<

009.

3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
NTM's evaluation
The Loan Trustee presupposes that the Bondholders are familiar with the stressed situation of HPRO through its financial reporting and as further outlined by the Company in the information

<<<

 meeting of the Bondholders on 23 February 2009, as well as set out in this summons. Pursuant to the Company, the current cash situation is critical for the Company and its stakeholders. The presented Restructuring Plan by the Company will,

<<<

 according to the Company, provide the Company with necessary funding through a two years hibernation scenario. The only alternative to the Restructuring Plan is likely to be a winding-up of the Company with a disposal of the Company's assets

<<<

 in the present market. The Company's hibernation strategy is based upon a market upturn in 2011-2012, and for bondholders agreeing to the expectation of this market upturn, the Company's proposal seems sensible. In today's challenging markets

<<<

, it is the Company's opinion that there is not possible to raise the necessary equity for the Restructuring Plan, and at the same time put in place equity instruments in favor of the Bondholders.
The Bondholders are requested to thoroughly

<<<

 evaluate whether the Proposal, based on the situation, and an assessment of the proposed changes, should be accepted. The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation from the Loan Trustee.
It is recommended that the

<<<

 Bondholders seek counsel from their tax advisors, legal advisors, financial advisors or other advisors regarding the effect of the proposed changes. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has

<<<

 challenges going forward and the Company might be unable to meet its commitments in the future.

Letter from HPRO regarding Restructuring of Hansa Property Group ASA

HANSA
PROPERTY V
To The owners, creditors and investors in Hansa Property

<<<

 Group AS

Date: March 23, 2009

Restructuring Hansa Property Group AS (HPRO)
1. History
HPRO was established by Pareto Equity AS the Summer of 2007 with the purpose of gathering several portfolios for property development in Norway, Scandinavia

<<<

 and the Baltic Countries (traditionally named the Hansa region), and establish a large leading property developer with a tradable share. According to this original plan HPRO would be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in the first half of 2

<<<

008.
After negotiations HPRO acquired 4 larger property portfolios in Norway, November 2007. These were Kaldnes Brygge in Tønsberg, Skårersletta at Lørenskog, Bo EN AS with several centrally located projects in Stavanger and a portfolio in the

<<<

 Bergen area counting a variety of residential projects. The portfolios were in different developmental stages from initiated building processes to options to buy land. Former owners were paid partly in cash and partly in HPRO shares. As part

<<<

 of the establishment process NOK 400 million were issued in Callable Bonds, and a N O K 160 million mortgage was signed with DnB (details below).
Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) were contracted as Management for Hire, and the building of an

<<<

 organization began with the signing of key personnel.
As market conditions changed the stock exchange introduction was postponed, and HPRO executed in its place a 150 million Rights Issue in the spring of 2008. Parallel to this an agreement

<<<

 was signed with Selvaag Bolig As giving HPRO a majority stake (70%) in a large property development portfolio in the greater Oslo region. As part of this settlement HPRO earned an additional cash influx of NOK 75 million, and a sales credit

<<<

, see below.
Enclosed is an overview of the Corporations legal structure (attachment 1), and a short overview of projects and property portfolios (attachment 2).

2, Background and the purpose behind restructuring
After the establishment of HPRO the property market has taken a harsh downturn, especially visible in the residential

<<<

 segment. This was part of the reasoning behind postponing the planned Stock Exhange listing. In its place capital was raised from existing shareholders through a rights issue. As part of the transaction the parties were informed that without

<<<

 the realization of assets or initiation of projects, HPRO would - through fulfillment of contractual engagements - run out of liquid funds in the first half of 2009.
Since the summer of 2008 there has been a reinforcement of the negative market

<<<

 development. Buyers of newly built residents are few and far between, as are buyers of land for development. Another factor is the very difficult market for finance leaving a restrictive attitude of finance institutions towards funding new

<<<

 projects, even ones with long secure rental contracts.
This has led to a devaluation of the portfolios and a re-evaluation of the implementation pace on projects. This again necessitates new thinking around the company's financial obligations

<<<

. HPRO will need additional capital for the continuous running of operations and to secure existing values in anticipation of the return of a healthier market. For the same reason HPRO went from ASA (public Ltd) to AS (Ltd.) in December 200

<<<

8 and share value was written down from NOK 25,- per share to NOK 1,- per share.
The Board resolved in the Autumn of 2008 to restructure the corporation with the objective of freeing up necessary capital and ensure the financial drive to serve

<<<

 debts and operational costs for a defined period running until Q3 2011, without depending on cash flow or the sale/realization of new projects. The values could then be sustained or built upon until a more normal market returns. This would

<<<

 ensure concentration, flexibility and predictability with HPRO, owners and creditors for an extended period. Without such a plan HPRO will, in keeping with contractual claims, run out of cash by March 2009.
As soon as acceptable market conditions

<<<

 occur HPRO will seek to start projects to create values,
Throughout the restructuring process HPRO has kept its creditors informed, and there has been no payment of debts apart from operational costs. One installment to DnBNOR of NOK 25 million

<<<

 has been placed on a separate bank account as the restructuring work has been done.
HPRO has engaged att. at law Leif Petter Madsen and more at the lawfirm Wikborg & Rein to assist in this process

3. Overview of debts anti main securities

<<<

 before restructuring

HPRO today has a total long term debt of approx. MNOK 2 O il as shown below. The debt has been ranged based on our assumptions on the creditors' securities, starting with the strongest security in the present market.

<<<

 portfolios, PwC was contracted as interim management at the same time as key personnel was hired for HPRO, Simultanously management agreements were signed with Sjølyst Utvikling AS for property development, Veidekke for accounting and Grant

<<<

 Management for supervising of the portfolios at Lørenskog and Kaldnes, respectively. All of these contracts have been terminated and provides significant cost reductions.
Furthermore there were changes made in corporate management in the autumn

<<<

 of 2008 that also provided cost savings.
Layoffs have been made in Stavanger, and corporate activity levels have stabilized on the minimum required to pay interests and operate in a way that secures the value of assets, including regulatory

<<<

 processes in preparation for launching in better market conditions.
Ail cost reductions are done.
4.2 Previous owners of the Stavanger portfolio
Rotac AS, TS Maskin AS, Svithun Finans AS og Masiv AS (sellers) sold the Stavanger portfolio to

<<<

 HPRO in November 2007, According to contract the sellers have a claim towards HPRO for the rest of the purchase amount; M NOK 221 payable at 1) MNOK 143 the regulation of Jaasund and 2) M N O K at the 78 at the regulation of Aase Gaard. This

<<<

 was an unsecured sales credit. Jaasund was regulated in February 2009 and Aase Gaard is expected to be regulated by November 2009. HPRO gave early notice to the sellers that there were no liquid funds to cover the installments at the agreed

<<<

 deadline.
After negotiations the sellers and HPRO have agreed on the following terms to a settlement:
S Signing of 496 000 shares in HPRO at NOK 25,- per share, equaling MNOK 12,4. After
signing, the Sellers will hold 5% of the shares In HPRO

<<<

Cash payment of NOK 25 million. The Sellers are here obliged to sign for 5 % in the equity issue.
V Sales credit of NOK 10 million. This credit will have 2. priority in property belonging to Aase Gaard AS, have

<<<

 an interest rating of 2,5% and is due for payment when Aase Gaard is sold to a third party. (The credit will thus not affect cash flow).

S Acquisition of 37,5% of shares in Bo EN AS. The purchase name the value of the shares in Bo
EN AS to

<<<

 N O K 174 millions. Book value is N O K 115 millions.
The settlement includes a reduction for HPRO at NOK 58,8 millions in relation to book value.
The parties agree on the terms and the agreement will be signed within March 26th.
4.3 D ull

<<<

 Nor
DnB holds before the restructuring the following engagements relating to the property portfolio organized in HPG Øst AS:
4 A loan to HPG Øst AS of MNOK 160 given when HPRO was established. The loan is secured with a guarantee attached to

<<<

 HPRO, 1. priority pledge in the shares of HPG Øst AS, BoEN AS and Sjølyst Eiendom AS, as well as a negative pledge term. The installments to the loan are due twice a year with MNOK 25, first time November 2008. Final installment to be paid

5 Construction loans to K1 (MNOK 123) and K2 (MNKO 37,5) at area F at Kaldnes Brygge.
Loans are overdue for payment, obligation is not upheld

<<<

. The loans have a 1. priority pledge in property.
S Different collected loans for land purchase in Kaldnes Byutvikling AS at a total of M NOK
92,5. Loans are agreed to be deducted with NOK 1500 per realized square meter. The loans in totalere

<<<

 due in a period from June 1st 2010 until January 1st 2011.
Margins in general are from 75 to 145 points above NiBOR,
HPRO and DnB Nor have agreed that after the restructuring the terms will be these:
S The loan to HPG Øst will not be deducted

<<<

 until 31.12.2011, at which point HPRO will start
paying half yearly installments of MNOK 25. Final payment is fixed at December 31st 2013, The only terms under which deductions will happen in this period are if realizations bring valid funds

<<<

 to HPG Øst as, and after debts are remunerated where realization happens. In
the case of such realizations 80% will go to down payments and 20% are to be freely used
Within the HPG Øst AS organization for operations and development.
S DnB Nor

<<<

 relent their pledge for 40% of the shares in BoEn AS. Installment set on bank
account in November 2008 is to be returned to HPRO.
S The construction loans are converted into long term financing and are to be deducted for if
realization occurs

<<<

 in K1 or K2. The loans will run until December 31st 2013.
·f The loan for purchase of land in Kaldnes Byutvikling AS is deducted with NOK 1500 per
realized square meter, with an added 50% of excess until the M NOK 123 related to K1 is fully

<<<

 paid.

Additionally DnB Nor have accepted to freeze margins on all loans until 30.06.2011 at NIBOR + 95125 points and adjust financial covenants to the restructuration situation.
The final agreement with DnBNOR is targeted to be settled within

<<<

 March 27th.
4.4 Seivaag Bolig AS
After the acquisition of the Seivaag portfolio in summer 2008 50% of the purchase price was paid in HPRO shares. The remaining 50%, NOK 176,6 million is a sales credit. The term for this credit is to pay installments

<<<

 as building starts on each part of the projects. The interest of the credit is NIBOR + 275 points. There is agreed a last due date of 18 months after estimated construction start on the separate projects. This means HPRO will have to settle

<<<

 the amount for each project even though building has not commenced. In the current market, where all project starts are postponed, this infers a substantial cash strain on HPRO, where first payments are due from 2010.
The credit is secured

<<<

 as a first priority pledge in HRPOs shares in the separate project companies, as well as a second priority pledge in the properties (after DnB Nor/Handelsbanken with M NOK 504,5).
An additional agreement has been signed where the parties agree

5, Project sales
5.1

<<<

 Introduction
Substansia AS ("Sub") and Sandland Holding AS ("SH") sold the projects now organized in HPG Vest to HPRO through a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA). Most of these projects are unregulated land options. The projects are thus some

<<<

 way into the future with substantial costs attached to the period up until they can bring capital, especially under current market conditions. A sale will save a lot of cash payments in the period.
5.2 Sale of Juvik Eiendomsselskap AS, T a

<<<

 k o f AS and Storbotn Eiendomsselskap A S
An agreement has been reached with SH where they buy back Takof AS, Juvik Eiendomsselskap AS and Storebotn Eiendomsselskap AS for a property value of NOK 32 million. The settlement is made by SH denouncing

<<<

 all rights (according to SPA) to earn-outs and post payments (estimated to NOK 22 million) and a sales credit of NOK 10 million secured with pledge in property and land. Payment of the sales credit is due when projects are realized, but no

<<<

 later than 01.03.2019.
The agreement must be seen in light of SHs obligation to pay HPRO NOK 11,5 million for failing to uphold his commitment to take part in the equity issue of spring 2008.

This debt is freed by HPROs acquisition of all

<<<

 of SHs shares in HPRO at the price of NOK 1 per share, the management agreement is cancelled and the remaining sum of NOK 8 million is paid within 2 years. The debt is secured with second priority pledges in property, pledge shares in subsidiaries

<<<

 to Sandland Holding AS, and a bailment from Thomas Sandland in person.
The parties agree on the terms and the settlement will be signed within March 27th.
5.3 Sales o f SkJo M n e s Utvikling AS
There are negotiations with Sub regarding Sub

<<<

's possible purchase of Skjoldnes Utvikling AS, and where the property value is set a NOK 135 million. After deducting debts the price for the shares is set at NOK 69 mill, and where payment will be as a mix of purchasing shares in HPRO, denouncing

<<<

 rights (according to SPA) to earn-outs and payments, sellers credit and cash payment.
There are still no conclusions to the negotiations, but HPROs restructuring is not dependent on this sale.
HPG Vest will after these (possible) sales include

<<<

 the project at Stord in collaboration with Aker which provides an ongoing cash flow, and the Moldegaard project which is part of Bjånes Utvikling AS and will be managed by Christian Foss.
5.4 Sales o f LSVN æ rin g A S - the APO building
Not

<<<

 connected to the restructuring of HPRO, but as a result of the difficulties to establish construction loans, HPRO has sold LSV Næring AS, including the project to build a new warehouse for APO. There were two interested parties in the project

<<<

. The purchase price is NOK 30 million and an additional NOK 6,2 million in a common infrastructure project at Lørenskog.

<<<

 funding to be able to pay interests and operational costs until Q3 2011 - please see enclosed Cash Flow Budget The need is estimated to be appr. NOK 300 million. HPRO has signed Pareto and SEB Enskilda as financial advisers for this process

<<<

.
7. Timeline

The group's 0.4 2008 financial statements have not been prepared as of date. Following the Q3 2008 unaudited accounts that was released in December 2008, the group would like to

<<<

 call the attention to the following material transactions/events and their potential effect on the group's financial statements;

1. The write-down exercise related to the value of the land and property projects will be made according to IFRS

<<<

 2. As of date the amount to be written down has increased from the indicated level of NOK 700 mill to a level of NOK 825 mill, factoring in a positive effect related to the reversal of earn out estimates for the projects being written-down

<<<

. The NOK 825 mill amount includes a material write down of prior capitalized project and land cost, reflecting that projects are being postponed and to a certain degree the need for revising prior plans.
2. Interest rate swaps. The group will

<<<

 record an unrealized loss related to interest swaps of NOK 25 mill at yearend. 3. Running cost and borrowing cost for the 4th quarter of 2008 will be charged to the profit and loss statement at yearend. 4. The company has reached an agreement

<<<

 in relation to a sellers' credit that originates from a transaction whereby the group acquired land and
projects in the Stavanger region in November 2007,Following the settlement of this credit, NOK 221 in total, the group is likely to record

<<<

 a gain of NOK 58 mill in Q2 2009 having a similar positive effect on the book value of the group's equity.
