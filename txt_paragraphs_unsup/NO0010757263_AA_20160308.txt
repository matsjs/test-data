<<<

 been made at that date.

1 2 .2.2

Except as otherwise expressly provided, all amounts payable under this Bond Agreement and any other Finance Document shall be payable in the same currency as the Bonds are denominated in. If, however, a Bondholder

<<<

 Bondholder may exercise one or more of his Conversion Right(s) at the Conversion Price at any time during the Exercise Period provided that notification thereof is given pursuant to clause 14.4.

The Conversion Right cannot be separated from

The number of Ordinary Shares to be issued on exercise of a Conversion Right shall be determined by dividing the principal amount of the relevant Bond or Bonds by the Conversion Price in effect on the relevant Conversion Date. The

 Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms set out in clauses 11.3.2, 15 and 16.

In order to exercise a Conversion Right, the Bondholder shall deliver to the Paying Agent (via its Account Manager) a duly completed

Subject to clause 14.6, conversion will be effected

<<<

 by a set-off of the total nominal value of the Bonds to be converted against the issuing of the whole number of Ordinary Shares resulting from dividing the total nominal value of the Bonds to be converted by the applicable Conversion Price

<<<

. Any excess amount beyond the whole number of Ordinary Shares converted by the Bonds shall fall to the Issuer and accordingly fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be issued or transferred upon exercise of a Conversion Right and no cash payment

<<<

 will be made in lieu thereof.

Notwithstanding clause 14.5, upon the exercise of the Conversion Right, the Issuer may for each Bond that is converted, exercise an option ("Cash S ettlem ent O ption") to redeem the Bond by

Settling the

 principal amount (USD 1.0) in cash, and

(b)

Issuing a number of shares equal to the difference between the

Parity Value and USD 1.0, divided by VWAP, where the Parity Value

and VWAP, is as defined in clause 11.2, and the Dealing Day is

<<<

 the

day when the Bondholders exercise their Conversion Rights.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer may elect to exercise its Cash Settlement Option regardless of the Conversion Right being exercised upon

EXECUTION VERSION

the occurrence

<<<

 of Change of Control Event or the Issuer having exercised its Call Option or any other event.

14.7

To exercise the Cash Settlement Option the Issuer must give a written notice to such effect to the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders via the

 Securities Register no later than 5 Banking Days after the Issuer's receipt from the Account Manager of the signed exercise notice as set out in clause 14.4.

 Bondholders, but shall accrue to the Issuer unless the Conversion Date shall fall on a Payment Date and/or the Maturity Date, then interest due shall be paid to the relevant Bondholder.

14.9

The Issuer shall (if relevant via the Paying Agent

(a)

carry the conversion into effect by issuing the correct number of new

Securities Register (at the account

 of the converting Bondholder),

(c)

and listing of the new Ordinary Shares on the Exchange (and shall

deliver any such documents and do any acts necessary in relation
