This communication of Written Procedure

<<<

 has been sent on 26 October 2016 to Bondholders directly registered in the register of Bondholders kept by the CSD. If you are an authorised nominee under the Finnish Book-Entry System Act, please forward this notice to the person you represent

<<<

 as soon as possible. Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date be registered in the register of Bondholders either as a direct registered owner or nominee with respect to one or several Bonds._______

________________

1. BACKGROUND
We refer to the terms and conditions governing the Bonds dated 6 March 2015 (the "Terms and Conditions"). Capitalised terms used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall have the meaning assigned to

<<<

 such terms in the Terms and Conditions.
The Issuer owns, indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary Kotkamills Oy (the "Target Company"), all issued and outstanding shares in L.P. Pacific Films Sdn. Bhd. ("LPPF"), a Malaysian limited liability

<<<

 company. LPPF operates an impregnating plant in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia, focusing on Imprex® films and core stock. The operations of LPPF are part of the Group's Industrial Products segment. For the financial year ended 31 December 2015, the

<<<

 turnover of LPPF was EUR 13.9 million (MYR 60.3 million).
Following the completion of the Acquisition, the Issuer has taken steps to improve liquidity, performance and profitability of the Target Company by optimising and developing existing

<<<

 operations. As part of such efforts, the Issuer has initiated a strategic review process concerning LPPF for the purposes of evaluating strategic options with respect to LPPF, including a potential disposal. The Issuer is contemplating entering

<<<

 into the following transactions:
(i) disposal of the shares in LPPF or the business of LPPF to a third party; and
(ii) allocation of the disposal proceeds from the disposal set out in paragraph (i) to other business lines and general corporate

<<<

 purposes,
(the transactions referred to in items (i) - (ii) together the "Transaction").
The Issuer estimates that if, as the outcome of the strategic review process concerning LPPF, the Issuer decides to sell the shares in LPPF or the business

<<<

 of LPPF to a third party, such disposal and allocation of the disposal proceeds to other business lines and general corporate purposes of the Group would create higher profits for the Group. Against this background, the Issuer believes that

<<<

 a structured disposal of LPPF to a third party could be an attractive proposal for the Group. Disposal

2 (3)
of LPPF would also enable the Group to focus on its production resources in Finland and streamline and accelerate its operations

<<<

. On the basis of the above, the Issuer is of the view that there would be sound business reasons for the Transaction.
According to the Issuer, completion of the Transaction would not affect the validity of the relevant Transaction Security

<<<

 with respect to assets in the ownership of the Target Company from time to time provided by the Target Company under the relevant Transaction Security Documents.
Pursuant to clause 13.6 (Disposal o fAssets) of the Terms and Conditions "the

<<<

 Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Subsidiary, sell or otherwise dispose o f any business, assets or shares in any Subsidiary" unless specifically allowed under the Terms and Conditions and, therefore, the Issuer requires a consent

<<<

 from the Bondholders to complete the Transaction. For the Request (as defined below) to be approved by the Bondholders, Bondholders representing at least 66 2/3 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Bondholders reply in the Written

<<<

 Procedure must consent to the Request.
The Issuer has requested the Trustee to choose a Written Procedure under which the Bondholders shall vote for the Request and provide the Bondholders with necessary instructions in respect of the procedure

<<<

.
2. REQUEST
The Issuer requests the following consents and waivers from the Bondholders under the Terms and Conditions for the purpose of completing the Transaction:
(i) consent to the Transaction and confirmation and agreement that clause

<<<

 13.6 (Disposal o f Assets) of the Terms and Conditions shall not apply to the Transaction; and
(ii) granting of consequent waivers of the relevant provisions of the Terms and Conditions, including but not limited to clause 13.6 (Disposal o

<<<

 fAssets),
(the consents and waivers set out in items (i)-(ii) above jointly the "Request").
Except as set out in the Request with respect to the Transaction, the Terms and Conditions shall remain unamended.
