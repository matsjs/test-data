/2018 ("EFOR01 PRO")
Oslo, 24 May 2018
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - E Forland AS
Nordic Trustee AS (the "Bond Trustee44) acts as bond trustee for the Bondholders in the above mentioned senior secured bond issue (the "Bonds44 or the "Bond

<<<

 Issue44) issued by E Forland AS (the "Issuer") and guaranteed by Frode Bjørn AS (the "Parent") under the bond agreement dated 2 September 2013 (the "Bond Agreement44).
Defined terms used in this summons shall have the meaning ascribed to them

<<<

 in the Bond Agreement unless otherwise set out herein or required by the context.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer, market conditions and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer and the Bond Trustee expressly

<<<

 disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 BACKGROUND
The Issuer owns the subsea vessel Rem Saltire, previously named Fugro Saltire. The Rem Saltire is financed through the Bonds. The current owner of the Issuer

<<<

, Frode Bjørn AS, also owned the subsea vessel Forland Inspector through its subsidiary Forland Subsea AS, but following a restructuring of Forland Subsea AS in November 2017, the Parent's indirect ownership in the vessel was reduced to 7.7

<<<

%.
In February 2017, EMAS AMC, the charterer of the Forland Inspector, filed for bankruptcy in Norway and its parent guarantor, Ezra Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Payment of the full charter hire ceased in November 20

<<<

16. Following the bankruptcy in EMAS AMC, the vessel remained mostly idle until a new 9 months firm contract with a reputable client was awarded in February 2017. However, the day rate is not sufficient to service scheduled debt instalments

<<<

. Furthermore, in August 2017, the time charter party for the Rem Saltire was terminated effective from 1 October 2017 by Fugro (originally scheduled to last until July 2018). The claim for early termination was settled in full early 2018 through

<<<

 a cash consideration and the Issuer getting ownership of some of the on-board equipment. The vessel recently commenced a new charter party with an estimated firm duration until mid September 2018 and additional 8 weeks options. The day rate

<<<

 is also here not sufficient to service scheduled debt instalments in full.
The day rates in the subsea segment are likely to remain relatively low in the medium term, and it is hence unlikely that new contracts will secure day rates sufficient

<<<

 to service scheduled interest and instalments in full. Free cash in the Issuer subsequent to completion of a special survey in April 2018 was just above NOK 20 million. Due to the charter hire being paid in arrears under the new charter party

<<<

 commenced in April, the Issuer may temporarily fall below the NOK 20 million free cash financial covenant until completion of the proposed bond refinancing, cf. below. Considering the uncertainty in start up of the next employment for Rem Saltire

<<<

 and the cash-flow implications thereof, including working capital needs, it is uncertain if the company will have sufficient funds to fulfill the payment obligations of the Bond Issue in full on 4 June 2018. The current liquidity situation

<<<

 is insufficient to carry the Issuer through to a market recovery. Currently, the Issuer's liquidity is around NOK 15 million which is below the existing financial covenants threshold.

In order to secure going concern and maximise value for all stakeholders, the Issuer intends to raise new equity and adapt the existing repayment profile and covenants to reflect the current market sentiment.
As announced

<<<

 in November 2017, the Parent and In Nord Vest AS ("INV") reached an agreement with the secured lenders in Forland Subsea AS (the owner of Forland Inspector) for a restructuring of the debt including inter alia new equity, reduced repayment

<<<

 profile and changes to the covenants. Following the equity issue which was made by INV directly into Forland Subsea AS, Frode Bjørn AS' ownership in this company was reduced to 7.7%.
INV is an investment company specialising in investments

<<<

 in OSV vessels. The company has an established management organization and team with extensive track record with operations worldwide and a broad customer base. In Nord Vest AS is controlled by Åge Remøy, Magnus Roth and Torsteinn Mar Baldvinsson

<<<

. Åge Remøy founded Rem Offshore ASA ("Rem") in 1996 and was CEO or chairman of the Board and main owner of that company until it merged with SolstadFarstad in 2016. Rem had among the lowest operating costs and strongest EBITDA margins among

<<<

 its peers. Magnus Roth and Torsteinn Mar Baldvinsson are experienced investors and operators in the maritime industry.
The key elements in the proposed restructuring are as follows:
1.1 New equity
The principal owner of the Parent, Torpevikvegen

<<<

 4-6 Eiendom AS, will sell its remaining 50% of the shares in the Parent to INV in connection with the contemplated restructuring. INV will further contribute with NOK 40 million less the amount in new equity subscribed for by Bondholders in

<<<

 new equity into the Issuer as part of the restructuring (as described below).
1.2 Proposed Bond Refinancing
· All existing financial covenants on Issuer and Parent level replaced with the following covenants on Issuer level (E Forland AS) until

<<<

 June 2021: o From 31 December 2019 to 30 June 2021: Asset Cover Ratio of minimum 100% o Minimum Cash of NOK 5 million until June 2021
· Maturity extended to 30 June 2021 (for the avoidance of doubt, the Interest Payment Dates will not be amended

<<<

)
· Fixed amortization from and including the Interest Payment Date in June 2018 reduced to NOK 4.5 million semi-annual payments (75% reduction)
· Introduction of a cash sweep mechanism (as described below) · Up front debt instalment of NOK

<<<

 30 million at par · Allow for INV to own up to 100% of the Parent and up to 100% of the Issuer without triggering
any Change of Control Event or Mandatory Redemption Event · NOK 40 million in new equity in the Issuer (the "Equity Issue") based

<<<

 on a pre money equity
valuation of NOK 2 million. o Bondholders are given an opportunity to participate with up to NOK 19.6 million on a pro rata basis (up to 49% of the Equity Issue). If all bondholders participate with its pro rate share

<<<

, they will receive a total ownership of 46.67% of the Issuer, o Over-subscription is allowed and any short fall coming from bondholders not using its right to participate will be allocated to subscribing bondholders pro rate to their ownership

<<<

 of bonds. o INV have committed to subscribe for the remaining NOK 20.4 million and any short fall coming from bondholders not using its right to participate to the extent not subscribed by the over-subscription of subscribing bondholders, o

<<<

 Bondholders holding bonds as of the date and time of this summons are eligible for participating in the Equity Issue. Bondholders that will subscribe for equity must deliver the irrevocable proxy (attached hereto) no later than the scheduled

<<<

 time of the Bondholders' Meeting to Arild Myrvoll at am@remoffshore.no. o The subscription right is personal and non-transferable, however, if the Bondholder is a

fund, the subscription in the Equity Issue can be made by another fund managed

<<<

 by the same investment manager. For the avoidance of doubt, neither INV nor any Bondholder subscribing for shares in the Equity Issue is required to pledge such shares as security for the Bond Issue.
