ISIN NO 001 039578.3 - 10.85% PetroMena ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010
Oslo, 13 July 2011
Proposal to Authorise Release of Mortgage over and sale of the SS Petrolia

 Rig - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
1. BACKGROUND
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"/"Norsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001 039578.3 where PetroMena

<<<

 ASA is the borrower (the "Borrower"). NTM expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to the information provided in this Summons. All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement

<<<

 related to the Bonds (the "Loan Agreement") unless otherwise stated. We refer to the Bondholder Summons issued by the Trustee on 23 June 2011 pursuant to which, on 1 July 20011, Bondholders approved a proposed sale by Petromena Ltd. ("PML"

<<<

) of the SS Petrolia (the "Rig") to a newly-incorporated SPV entity to be owned and financed the Bondholders ("BidCo") and the release of the mortgage (the "Mortgage") granted to secure repayment of the Bonds (the "23 June Summons"). In particular

<<<

, in summary, the approved sale price for the Rig was cash consideration of not less than either US$2 million, in circumstances where Bidco would utilise the Rig in connection with a drilling contract the subject of a tender by Bravo Drilling

<<<

, or (ii) in all other cases, US$1.00.
In addition, the 23 June Summons sought to commence a process to establish levels of interest amongst Bondholders to own and finance BidCo, in particular via an equity raise (the "Equity Raise") intended

<<<

 to provide BidCo with sufficient capital to meet an anticipated funding requirement of up to US$41m (the "Funding Requirement"), including for an upgrade project as described in the 23 June Summons.
2. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE PREVIOUS SUMMONS

<<<


Since the approval of the resolutions proposed pursuant to the 23 June Summons, BidCo sought to establish the level of interest of Bondholders to participate in the Equity Raise. Unfortunately, it became apparent that BidCo was unable to attract

<<<

 sufficient interest in the Equity Raise in order to satisfy the Funding Requirement and finance the upgrade project.
Accordingly, the process of Bondholders establishing and financing BidCo so that BidCo can purchase the Rig, has been unsuccessful

<<<

, and this avenue can no longer be pursued.
However, notwithstanding this, PML did receive certain offers during the course of last week, including from independent third parties, for the purchase of the Rig. The highest offer was for an amount

<<<

 of US$9.5 million, and were subject to certain conditions. However, the conditions imposed did not make it possible to present the offer to the bondholders, and expired on Friday evening.
In parallel, certain entities invested in the Bonds

<<<

 who had been willing to participate in Bidco had there been sufficient interest in the Equity Raise, have offered to purchase the Rig without any conditions save for the release of the Mortgage. The offer (the "Offer") by these funds (the 

<<<

"Proposed Purchaser") to PML are to purchase the Rig on an "as is, where is" basis in international waters outside of Corpus Christ, for cash consideration of US$5,000,000, plus reimbursement of up to

$800,000 of the towage costs incurred in moving the Rig to international waters. Accordingly, the Offer has a value to PML

<<<

 of up to US$5,800,000. The Proposed Purchaser is willing to complete the purchase as soon as possible, and by no later than Friday 15th July.
The terms contemplated by the Offer present a significant increase in the sale price for the Rig previously

<<<

 approved by Bondholders, and avoids PML incurring the significant costs of moving the Rig to Mexico, which would have been funded out of amounts that could otherwise be distributed to Bondholders. The Offer also provides near term certainty

<<<

 of return to Bondholders in relation to the Rig.
A group of Bondholders holding in excess of 66.66% of the Bonds (excluding the Bonds held by the Proposed Purchaser or its affiliated entities) have expressed their support for proceeding with

<<<

 the sale to the Proposed Purchaser contemplated by the Offer, notwithstanding whether any higher bids may ensue. The reason for this is that the Rig must leave its current location by 15 July 2011, and the certainty presented by a sale to the

<<<

 Proposed Purchaser is considered to be extremely valuable relative to the risks of committing to a transfer to Mexico and any third party sale then not materializing. The Supporting Bondholders have entered into binding agreements to vote in

<<<

 favour of the proposals set out in this Summons.
3. SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL
Accordingly it is proposed that NTM formally approves that PML sell the Rig to the Proposed Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Offer, and releases the Mortgage

<<<

 over the Rig in connection with the sale.
4. EVALUATION
Neither NTM, PML, Petromena ASA, Mr. Ro or any of their advisers are making any recommendation as to the matters referred to in this Summons. Bondholders should independently evaluate

<<<

 the proposals set forth in this Summons and vote accordingly.
5. SUMMONS FOR BONDHOLDERS' MEETINGS
