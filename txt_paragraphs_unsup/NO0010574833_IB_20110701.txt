Interpretation of Bond Agreement Mandatory Prepayment Event

2
1 The dispute and its background
(1) The

<<<

 Norwegian businessman Bjarne Skeie entered into "turn-key" construction contracts for 3 harsh environment jack-up rigs with the Singapore shipyard Keppel Fels in December 2006 - June 2007. The present dispute relates to the first of these dated

<<<

 6 December 2006.
(2) The rigs were ordered through Skeie Drilling & Production ASA [SKDP]. The contracts were later novated to 3 Cypriote subsidiaries of SKDP, set up for the purpose of buying and managing each of the rigs. The construction

<<<

 contract for the first rig to be delivered was tranferred to SKDP 1 Ltd.
(3) The initial price of each rig was approximately USD 500 million. The rigs were financed through the issuing of shares and bonds in 2007. Following the global economical

<<<

 crisis a restructuring took place in 2009, which included a debt write-off of USD 300 million and a conversion of bond loans to equity capital.
(4) The last instalment to the shipyard was financed with a first priority bond issue for each rig

<<<

. The bond loan for the first rig was in the amount of USD 225 million. A Term Sheet was made available to prospective investors on 22 April 2010, and the Bond Agreement between the Issuer SKDP 1 Ltd. and the Bondholders represented by Norsk

<<<

 Tillitsmann ASA as their trustee was entered into on 14 May 2010.
(5) The present dispute relates to the interpretation of the definition o f "Mandatory Prepayment Event" in this Bond Agreement, namely the first of the five alternatives of

<<<

 the definition: "the rig is sold". The question is whether a subsequent sale of the rig to an affiliated company constitutes a "sale" according to the Agreement.
(6) In July 2010 Rowan Companies Inc. acquired the shares in SKDP, the parent

<<<

 o f the 3 Cypriote single-purpose companies owning the 3 rigs. SKDP was renamed Rowan Drilling Norway AS.
(7) Subsequently, the rigs were transferred to Marine Blue Ltd. in Gibraltar. This company also owns many of Rowan's other rigs.
(8) Rig

<<<

 No. 1 ("Rowan Viking") was delivered on 29 September 2010. Because no operational contract had been entered into at this date, USD 25 million o f the bond loan had to be repaid in accordance with clause 10.1 of the Bond Agreement. Funds for

<<<

 the repayment were released from the escrow account where the total loan of USD 225 million was placed. The rest of the loan (USD 200 million) was paid out to the shipyard on delivery of the rig.
(9) On 21 September 2010 Mr. Finn Bjornstad

<<<

 o f the law firm Wikborg, Rein & Co. gave notice to Norsk Tillitsmann o f the delivery o f the rig and its planned transfer.

3
The latter was named the "Expected Transaction" and described as
"a sale o f the Rig, or a sale o f the shares

<<<

 in SKDP 1 Ltd ... in connection with a reorganisation o f the ownership o f the Rig". The rig or the shares would be integrated into "Rowan's international ownership structure, through a subsidiary organized in Gibraltar",
Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 was also given notice that
"The Expected Transaction w ill constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event, and SKDP 1 Ltd will make a prepayment and redeem the Outstanding Bonds upon its completion in accordance with clause 10.4 o f the Loan Agreement

<<<

."
In an e-mail 14 September 2010 Ms. Melanie Trent o f Rowan enquired whether it was "okay" for the boards of SKDP 1 and its parent "to approve in the alternative (i.e. either a rig sale or transfer of shares)". On the following day Mr. Bjornstad

<<<

 replied: "Spoken "off record" to Jo Forfang being responsible at the loan trustee and he appreciate to be kept informed and cannot see any problems in our approach. He may when he gets the letter discuss with their lawyers!".
(10) The following

<<<

 events have been sparsely documented to the Tribunal.
(11) However, it is clear that it was decided to sell the rigs and not the shares. On 29 October 2010 Rowan Viking was sold to Marine Blue Ltd. The price was USD 410 million of which USD

<<<

 334 million was payable at the closing time and the rest "shall remain outstanding" as an interest bearing debt. The terms and repayment of the debt are regulated in a separate loan agreement dated 1 November 2010.
(12) Why it was decided to

<<<

 sell the rigs and not the shares, is unclear to the Tribunal. Ms. Trent has explained that the former alternative was preferable to Rowan, but it is unclear whether the choice was discussed with Norsk Tillitsmann or if Norsk Tillitsmann expressed

<<<

 any views on the matter.
But at some point it became clear that Norsk Tillitsmann disputed Rowan's right to implement the Expected Transaction with the advised consequence that the Mandatory Redemption clause 10.4 became applicable.
Consequently

<<<

, the parties entered into an Escrow Agreement on 28 October 2010. In this it was agreed that the payment of USD 226,733 million would be deemed foil repayment o f the bond loan, on the condition that another USD 11,2 million was paid into an

<<<

 escrow account with DnB Nor Bank. The former amount was 108 % of the outstanding loan, plus USD 10.8 million in interest from 20 May 2010 to 1 November 2010.
The second amount is the amount in dispute in this case.
(13) Furthermore, in order

<<<

 to solve the dispute the parties on 9 December 2010 entered into an Arbitration Agreement.

4
Section 3.1 o f the agreement defines the "Dispute to be resolved by the Arbitration":
"The issue that shall be referred to and finally solved by

<<<

 the Arbitration (the "Dispute") is whether the Transaction constituted a Mandatory Prepayment Event that would require and entitle the Issuer to conduct a mandatory redemption o f the Outstanding Bonds in accordance with clause 10.4.1 o f the

<<<

 Bond Agreement upon completion o f the Transaction."
The "Transaction" is defined as the transfer of the rig "to another subsidiary o f Rowan".
(14) The parties regulated the consequences of the arbitration award in Section 3.2:
"The parties

<<<

 agree that: a) if the arbitration award (the "Award") concludes that the Transaction constitutes a
Mandatory Prepayment Event, the Escrow Amount, together with interest accrued thereon, shall immediately be released to the Issuer pursuant to

<<<

 the terms o f the Escrow Agreement; and b) if the Award concludes that the Transaction does not constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event, the Escrow Amount together with interest accrued thereon, shall immediately be released to the Bond Trustee

<<<

, as trustee for the Bondholders pursuant to the terms o f the Escrow Agreement, for onward payment to the Bondholders."
The Escrow Amount is the amount of USD 11,2 million deposited under the Escrow Agreement of 28 October 2010.
(15) It would

<<<

 seem to follow from this that the task for the Tribunal is solely to determine whether the Transaction constituted a Mandatory Prepayment Event under the Bond Agreement of 14 May 2010.
This is a question that can be answered only in the affirmative

<<<

 or in the negative.
Furthermore, it is not the task of the Tribunal to determine the interpretation and possible application of other clauses in the Bond Agreement, such as clause 10.2.
And, since the parties have agreed on the consequences

<<<

 of the two possible outcomes of the arbitration, neither is this a task for the Tribunal.
2 The arbitration process
(16) In accordance with Section 5 o f the Arbitration Agreement the parties have submitted several written pleadings to the

<<<

 Tribunal, with several hundred pages of exhibits.
(17) An oral hearing was held on 7 and 8 June 2011 in Oslo.
Mr. Ristvedt and Mr. Haaskjold argued the case for their parties.

5
Ms. Melanie Trent gave testimony on behalf of the plaintiff

<<<

, and Mr. Jo Forfang did the same on behalf of the defendant.
The following witnesses testified: Mr. Finn Bjornstad Mr. Stian Winther Mr. Richard Sjoqvist Mr. Bernhard Hovden.
3 The submissions and claims of the parties 3.1 The plaintiff
(1

<<<

8) The plaintiff submits that the Transaction constituted a Mandatory Prepayment Event, since "sold" must be interpreted as including an internal sale as the one at hand.
(19) It is alleged that the parties had this understanding of the clause

<<<

 when the Bond Agreement was entered into.
That the plaintiff did attach this meaning to the "sale" definition, follows from the fact that Mr. Bjarne Skeie generally wanted as much flexibility as possible when the Agreement was made.
The defendant

<<<

 must have had the same meaning, as there are indications that Mr. Jo Forfang when the dispute arose expressed this opinion.
It is difficult to know what the many and unknown Bondholders meant, but it is likely that they attached the same meaning

<<<

 to it as the plaintiff does. The reason is that this follows from a normal reading of the clause.
If it is established that the parties attached the same meaning to the clause, this meaning prevails.
(20) Notwithstanding this, the same meaning

<<<

 follows from an objective interpretation of the clause.
All legal sources emphasize the importance of sticking to the wording in cases like this. This is a commercial case with professional parties, and the parties are numerous and may change

<<<

 and have in fact done so. As a consequence, it would be impractical and inefficient to rely on any subjektive meanings attached by any of the parties.
The supreme court has ruled that there is a heavy burden of proof on a party alleging a deviation

<<<

 from the wording. The position of the defendant that internal sales must be excluded from the "sale" definition is a substantial deviation, and there is no proof that the parties had such an intention.

6
The only thing that might exclude

<<<

 the Transaction from the "sale" alternative, would be proof o f a circumvention. No such proof exists and this has not even been alleged. This is a bona fide transaction at arm's length. The price was set by independent accountants and experts

<<<

 in accordance with market prices, and the rig will not be returned to the seller.
The Bondholders had the possibility to ask for a clarification, if they thought the wording to be unclear. Some of them did this with regard to other clauses

<<<

 in the Bond Agreement.
The Agreement is a well prepared document with a high level of detail, and the parties were assisted by legal expertise.
It would be unreasonable to award the Bondholders a premium of USD 11,2 million. They have got their

<<<

 money back with high interests. The reason why they did not want to be redeemed, was that the loan became quite safe when Rowan bought the rigs.
Finally, the reality is that the rigs were sold - it only took two steps instead of one.
(21) The

<<<

 plaintiffs claim is as follows: 1. The Transaction constitutes a Mandatory Prepayment Event that would require and entitle SKDP 1 Ltd. to conduct a mandatory redemption o f the Outstanding Bonds in accordance with clause 10.4.1 of the Bond

<<<

 Agreement with Norsk Tillitsmann ASA upon completion of the Transaction.
2. SKDP 1 Ltd. is entitled to the entire Escrow Amount o f USD 11,200,000 which SKDP 1 Ltd. har deposited with Norsk Tillitsmann AS and the said Escrow Amount, together

<<<

 with interest accrued thereon, shall therefore immediately be released to SKDP 1 Ltd. by Norsk Tillitsmann ASA pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (which forms a part of the Arbitration Agreement dated 9 December 2010).
3. Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA is to pay all costs to the Arbitration Tribunal, including the fees of the arbitrators and the costs otherwise related to the arbitration, by 14 calendar days following the award.
4. Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is to pay alle costs to SKDP 1

<<<

 Ltd. related to the arbitration by 14 days following the award.
3.2 The defendant (22) The defendant submits that the Transaction did not constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event, since "sold" must be read with a proviso relating to an internal

<<<

 transfer. Only a bona fide sale on commercial terms to a third party is included, whereas inter-group sales are excluded.

7
(23) As to the question of subjective inteipretation, the defendant alleges that there is no proof of any such meanings

<<<

 at all. Consequently, an objective interpretation must be conducted.
(24) To exclude internal transfers from the term "sold" does not amount to a deviation from the wording. On the contrary, most people - and especially lawyers and market operators

<<<

 like professional bondholders - will automatically exclude such transfers from the term upon reading such a clause.
The actual motives for the Transaction are irrelevant. The point is that the plaintiffs interpretation of the clause would undermine

<<<

 entirely the suspension o f the call option the first year of the loan, since the Issuer in practice would have full control over when redemption is to take place. This is a clear deviation of what is agreed in the Bond Agreement.
A vital characteristic

<<<

 o f a "sale" is the irreversibility o f the transfer, the seller says good-bye to the asset. This is different in internal transfers. The transaction can be reversed at the group's discretion.
In many areas of the law special rules apply to

<<<

 internal transfers. Tax rules are probably most important, but often special rules and exceptions are applicable on tranfers between realatives and other parties that are close.
The reason behind the Mandatory Redemption clause is to protect

<<<

 the Bondholders. They should get their money back, if events occur that may change their risk substantially. This is not the case with internal tranfers, the risk stays the same.
The Bondholders had no reason to ask for a clarification, as

<<<

 an internal sale was not an option within the Skeie Group. The Issuer, on the other hand, ought to have made his intention clear, if he, despite this, wanted to have this opening in the Agreement.
The Bond Agreement is not complete. It has

<<<

 been drafted in Norwegian style and has to be supplemented.
(25) The defendant's claim is as follows:
1. The Transaction does not constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event, and does not entitle or require SKDP 1 Ltd. to conduct a mandatory redemption

<<<

 of the Outstanding Bonds in accordance with clause 10.4.1 o f the Bond Agreement with Norsk Tillitsmann ASA upon completion o f the Transaction.
2. The entire Escrow Amount of USD 11,200,000 deposited at Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, together with

<<<

 interest accmed thereon, shall immediately be released to Norsk Tillitsmann ASA for onward payment to the Bondholders.
3. SKDP 1 Ltd. shall pay all costs and expenses to Norsk Tillitsmann ASA in accordance with clause 8 of the Arbitration Agreement

<<<

.

8
4. SKDP 1 Ltd. shall pay all costs to the Arbitration Tribunal, including the fees of the arbitrators and the costs and expenses otherwise related to the arbitration.

4 The reasons for the award of the Tribunal
4.1 The relevant clauses

<<<

 of the Bond Agreement
(26) Chapter 10 in the Bond Agreement is entitled "Maturity of the Bonds, Call Option and Redemption".
According to clause 10.1 the Bonds should be repaid in 4 annual instalments of USD 20 million in May 2013, 2014, 2

<<<

015 and 2016, which means that no repayment was scheduled to take place in the first 3 years of the loan period. The rest o f the loan, USD 145 million, should be repaid at Maturity Date, i.e. on 19 May 2017.

(27) However, according to clause

<<<

 10.2 the plaintiff had a "Call Option", as he might "redeem the entire Bond Issue".
Such a voluntary redemption could take place at the Issuer's will, but there was a premium to be paid. The issuer would have to repay more than 100 % o f the

<<<

 loan, The premium varied from 7 % at the beginning of the loan period to 2 % the last year before maturity.

(28) A special feature in this case is that the time period in which the Issuer could call the loan was limited, as the loan could

<<<

 not be called the first year. This can be inferred from the listing in the clause of the periods in which the loan could be called, the first one starting on 20 May 2011.

Initially, there was no such limitation. This was introduced as part

<<<

 o f a "sweetener", when it turned out that the bonds were difficult to sell.

On 7 May 2010, the same day the books were to close, the following "Revised and new terms" were published:

"Coupon Rate:

11.50 - 12 % p.a.

Issuer's call option

<<<

: None call first 12 months, thereafter at any time ..."

The original interest rate was 10 %.

The defendant has argued that the buyers of the bonds were motivated by these revised terms, and that they had the justified expectation that the

<<<

 bonds at least for a year would yield this high interest. The Tribunal assumes that this is correct.

Furthermore, the Tribunal considers the Issuer's call option to be the main intended remedy in order to get out o f the Bond Agreement.



<<<

9
(29) The Call Option clause was further amended at a very late stage.
In the Bond Agreement it says that the Issuer may redeem "the entire Bond Issue", whereas the wording of the last draft sent to the Bondholders was "The Issuer may redeem

<<<

 parts of the Bond Issue or the entire Bond Issue".
It seems that this change was made between 12 May 2010 and 14 May 2010. The revised version is only mentioned in the documents in a revised Term Sheet from BAHR on 11 May 2010, in which the

<<<

 text is "The Issuer may redeem the Bonds (all or nothing)".
Altough this revision seems to have been made subsequent to the initial sale of the bonds, any later sale o f bonds would probably have been made on the basis o f the final wording

<<<

. It seems that this final revision further strengthens the expectations of the Bondholders to receive the high yield for at least a year.
(30) Clause 10.3 contains a corresponding right for the Bondholders to get out of the Bond Agreement by

<<<

 exercising a "Put Option". The resulting pre-payment would be "at a price o f 100 % o f par value".
This right of pre-payment is given to "each Bondholder" separately.
The put option may be exercised "Upon the occurrance of a Change of Control

<<<

 Event", which is defined as a substantial change in the ownership o f the Parent (SKDP), namely the change o f ownership to "more than 50 % o f the outstanding shares of the Parent".
It is not clear to the Tribunal whether the sale of the shares

<<<

 to Rowan in July 2010 gave the Bondholders the right to exercise their put option. The reason for this is the exception for sales to "a reputable international drilling operator". The Tribunal assumes that Rowan falls within this definition

<<<

, but the question has not been commented upon by the parties.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal assumes that no Bondholders had any wish to exercise the put option and never did so. On the contrary, the point in the present case seems to be that the

<<<

 Bondholders had a strong interest in maintaining the loan and thus obtain the high yield for at least a full year.
(31) The Mandatory Redemption clause in 10.4 is not in the same way as the call option and the put option a similar "right" for

<<<

 any or all parties. Apparently, there is no element o f choice here. If a Mandatory Prepayment Event occurs, repayment "shall" take place:
"Upon a Mandatory Prepayment Event occurring the Issuer shall redeem 100 % o f the Outstanding Bonds

<<<

 as on levels equal to the Issuer's Call Option at the Payment date (however redemption level being 108 % during the first year after Settlement Date when no Call Option applies) (plus accrued interest on redeemed amount), and provided that

<<<

 payment shall be made on the day the Issuer is receiving the proceeds following the relevant Mandatory Prepayment Event."

10
(32) The extent to which this clause can function as an instrument for the parties to terminate the loan, will depend

<<<

 upon the definition o f the Mandatory Prepayment Events.
The definition in the Bond Agreement reads as follows:
"Mandatory Prepayment Event" means either one o f the following events: (i) the Rig is sold, (ii) there is an actual or constructive

<<<

 total loss o f the Rig, (iii) the Construction Contract is terminated by the Yard, (iv) the Rig is not delivered within 29 March 2011, or (v) the Parent ceases to be the owner of 100 % o f the shares in the Issuer and the
Charterer."
The Tribunal

<<<

 assumes that the Issuer can influence, directly or indirectly, the occurance o f most of these events. The two events that are relevant i this case, Nos. (i) and (v), are both events which occurance is at the sole discretion of the Issuer.

<<<


It would seem quite clear, then, that in principle this clause in effect can undermine the "right" of the Bondholders to receive the agreed high interest for at least the first year.
(33) Notwithstanding this, it is the understanding of the

<<<

 Tribunal that Mandatory Redemption clauses in general are perceived as seeming the interests of bondholders.
The reason for this probably is that the occurance of such events normally is viewed as a major change o f the premises for the loan

<<<

. The event may increase the risk on the part of the Bondholder with regard to the repayment o f the loan and/or the payment of interest.
However, if this clause solely had the purpose to protect the interests of the Bondholders, it would seem

<<<

 to have been more appropriate to give the Bondholders a choice. In other words, the Bondholders would seem to be better served by having a put option with regard to these events as well as Change of Control Events.
Consequently, it may be inferred

<<<

 that clause 10.4 is not intended solely to protect the interests o f the Bondholders.
The Tribunal is of the opinion that the reasons for the repayment according to this clause being mandatory, are that:
(a) There is no longer any need for

<<<

 the loan. (b) The premises for obtaining and/or giving the loan have changed
substantially.
(a) applies to events Nos, (ii) and (iii).

11
(a) would also seem to apply to No. (i), since the Issuer, being a single-purpose company, would have

<<<

 no further need for the loan. The obtained revenue can be used to repay the loan.
(b) also seems to apply to Nos. (i) - (iii).
Event No. (iv) does not seem to be so vital, depending on the length o f the delay.
The same seems to be even more

<<<

 true with regard to event No. (v). It does not appear obvious that such a change should automatically lead to a full repayment o f the loan, especially if only a small minority of the shares is sold.
(34) In the written defence submissions

<<<

 to the Tribunal the defendant has also argued that a sale of the rig or the shares could have been done under clause 18.2 about "Defeasance":
"The Issuer may, at its option and at any time elect to have certain obligations discharged (see Clause

<<<

 18.2.2) upon complying with the following conditions ("Covenant Defeasance"): (i) the Issuer shall have irrevocably pledged to the Bond Trustee for the benefit o f the
Bondholders cash or government obligations accepted by the Bond Trustee

<<<

 (the "Defeasance Pledge") in such amounts as will be sufficient for the payment o f principal (including if applicable premium payable upon exercise o f a Call Option) and interest on the Outstanding Bonds to Maturity Date (or redemption upon

<<<

 exercise o f a notified Call Option;
(ii - (vi)".
The discharge o f the obligations seem to have the consequence that the Issuer is free to do whatever it chooses.
The conditions of No. (i) seem to be that the Issuer in effect has to repay

<<<

 the loan at 107 % and pay interest up to 19 May 2011.
These are the same economical conditions as the Issuer would have to meet were it to call the loan at the earliest possible date, see section 3.1 (a) of the Arbitration Agreement. However

<<<

, whereas the Issuer has a right, "at its option and at any time", to exercise its option under clause 18.2, it does not have the right to exercise the call option under clause 10.2 at all during the first year.
(35) Clause 13.3.4 in chapter

<<<

 13 about "Covenants" reads as follows:
"The Issuer shall not be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose o f all or a substantial part o f its assets or operations, unless the Loan is repaid in full pursuant to Clause 10.2 or Clause 10.4."
It

<<<

 seems difficult to interpret this in any other way than that the Issuer is entitled to sell the rig, if clause 10.4 is applicable and the loan is repaid in full according to the terms in this clause.

I
12
Since clause 10.2 is not applicable

<<<

 during the first year, it must follow that the Issuer is not entitled to sell the rig during this period under this clause at all, and thus it does not matter what amount is being offered in repayment.
Consequently, a sale of the rig was not

<<<

 contrary to the Bond Agreement only if the sale was a Mandatory Prepayment Event.
(36) Another matter is whether a sale o f the shares in the plaintiff could take place under the Bond Agreement. As pointed out i (9), this was the second alternative

<<<

 in the Expected Transaction.
The shares were allegedly pledged to the Bondholders. This seems to be in accordance with the listing of "the Issuer Share Pledge" as part o f the "Security Interest" in clause 1.1 of the Agreement.
If the shares

<<<

 could not be sold without the consent of the Bondholders, it is difficult to see why the sale o f (any) shares in the Issuer is a Mandatory Prepayment Event.
A solution may be that a sale o f shares could take place without the consent o f

<<<

 the Bondholders, but then the loan had to be repaid in full under the terms of clause 10.4. On the other hand, if the Bondholders consented to the sale, the loan would not have to be repaid. But this will probably always be the case, neither

<<<

 a sale o f the rig nor the shares will lead to repayment, if the parties agree that this shall not be the case.
Another possibility is that the pledge of the shares does not mean that the Bondholders can always deny their consent. Particularly

<<<

 if all the shares are sold, it may be argued that the Bondholders have a duty to consent and get repayment under clause 10.4.
However, it is difficult for the Tribunal to speculate on this, having too little information about the share pledge

<<<

.
(37) Finally, clause 13.4 ("Corporate and operational matters") should be mentioned.
(38) Clause 13.4.1 of the Bond Agreement deals with "Inter-group transactions" and reads as follows:
"All transactions between any companies in the Group

<<<

 shall be on commercial terms, and shall comply with all applicable provisions o f applicable corporate law applicable to such transactions, including, in respect o f Norwegian companies, Section 3-9 o f the Private or Public Limited Companies

<<<

 Acts 1997."
Contrary to the contention of the defendant the Transaction is no "inter-group transaction", as "the Group" is defined as "the Parent and its subsidiaries" and "a "Group Company" means the Parent or any o f its subsidiaries (including

<<<

 the Issuer and the Charterer)". The buyer in the Transaction, Marine Blue Ltd., is not a company within the Group.

13
(39) Clause 13.4.2 deals with "Transactions with shareholders, directors or affiliated companies". The Issuer shall cause

<<<

 all transactions between these
"to be entered into in the ordinary course o f business and pursuant to the reasonable requirement o f the Issuer's business, and on commercial terms, not less favourable to the Group Company than would have prevailed

<<<

 in an arms' length transaction with a third party."
It would seem that this clause is applicable on the Transaction, as Marine Blue Ltd. probably is an "indirect shareholder" o f the Issuer.
4.2 Interpretation and application of clause 10.

<<<

4 - "Mandatory Redemption" (40) The task of the Tribunal is to "finally solve" the dispute by deciding whether the Transaction constituted a "Mandatory Prepayment Event" that made clause 10.4 of the Bond Agreement applicable, see (13). In order

<<<

 to do this, the clause and the definition must be interpreted and applied on the facts of the case.
Clause 10.4, see (31), itself does not give rise to particular problems with regard to its interpretation or application. If a Mandatory Prepayment

<<<

 Event occurs, it clearly follows from 10.4.1 that the loan shall be redeemed at 108 % plus accrued interest up to the date of repayment.
The notice given on 21 September 2010, see (9), was in accordance with the requirement in 10.4.2 o f "at

<<<

 least thirty Business Days prior to the settlement date of any such mandatory redemption (at least if the date of the notice and the settlement date are included).
Thus, the problem the Tribunal is faced with is to interpret and apply the definition

<<<

 of "Mandatory Prepayment Event", see (32), particularly alternative (i) - "the Rig is sold" .
(41) Under Norwegian law any actual mutual meaning attached to the words of an agreement prevails.
In a complex situation like in this case, with

<<<

 a large number o f persons and companies involved, it may be difficult to decide which persons are relevant. In addition, the Bondholders will change when bonds are sold. It may also be difficult to decide at what time the meaning was attached

<<<

.
However, in this case the Tribunal agrees with the defendant that there is no convincing evidence that any of the parties in fact did attach any detailed meaning at all to the word "sold" in this context.
This was not a predominant question

<<<

 at all at the time. The fact that a person probably would have attached a particular meaning to the word had he been asked or had he thought about it, is not proof that he actually did think about it and did attach a meaning. There is no indication

<<<

 that this question was raised by anyone or discussed.

14
(42) Consequently, the Tribunal must have recourse to "objective" interpretation, i.e. attach the meaning to the phrase that a reasonable person would attach to it under the circumstances

<<<

. This means that if the language has a generally prevailing meaning, it is interpreted in accordance with that meaning.
(43) It is also accepted that technical terms are given their technical meaning when used in a transaction within their

<<<

 technical filed. It may be said that the issuing of financial bonds takes place in a technical field somewhat remote from the life of ordinary people. It is a highly specialised field both technically and legally.
However, the concept of a

<<<

 "sale" is well-known to everyone. Nevertheless, the Tribunal thinks the most appropriate standard of interpretation in this case is a local standard in the sense that it seems natural to take into account general legal knowledge about sales

<<<

 and the transfer of assets, including legal problems that often arise in such transfers. Such problems are also well known to professional businessmen and investors.
(44) The history of the Mandatory Prepayment Event definition is somewhat

<<<

 uncertain.
The initial financing of the rig in 2007 included a USD 165 million bond loan. In the Bond Agreement of 20 February 2007 there was a mandatory redemption clause with an integrated definition of the events leading to a redemption

<<<

. This definition incudes 4 o f the 5 events in the definition pertaining to clause 10.4 of the 2010 Bond Agreement.
The wording is somewhat different: "if (i) the Rig is assigned, sold or disposed o f '. This may be somewhat broader, but the

<<<

 essence still seems to be that the rig is "sold" .
It has been argued that this clause has been imported into the Bond Agreement of 2010, and this may be so. On the other hand, the witnesses have stated that the Mandatory Prepayment Events

<<<

 are events that are normally found in such agreements, and that they thus are the events that one would expect to find in such an agreement.
(45) Consequently, any arguments relating to the interpretation of the 2007 agreement will be of limited

<<<

 value to the case at hand.
The plaintiff has argued that the exception in the clause for a certain "novation" indicates that internal sales are included in "sold", as the exception would otherwise be unnecessary.
The clause reads as follows

<<<

:
"If (i) the Rig is assigned, sold or disposed of, or in the event o f a total loss or a constructive total loss o f the Rig, or (ii) if the Construction Contract is sold, assigned (other than (i) novated to the Guarantor and/or assigned as

<<<

 security for the First Loan and this Loan), cancelled or disposed o f , ..."

15
According to the understanding o f the Tribunal, the plaintiff was acting as a guarantor under this agreement, whereas SKDP was the borrower. Thus, the novation

<<<

 mentioned here was a transfer from the Parent to the subsidiary for whose benefit the loan was arranged. The fact that such a transfer was excepted, was to be expected and does not seem to have much bearing on the case at hand.
It ought to

<<<

 be added, that the exception does not pertain to the sale o f the rig, but to the assignment of the construction contract. It can also be added, that the mentioning of a planned transfer probably was made for the sake of clarity, and that this

<<<

 does not necessarily mean that the same result could not have been arrived at without the express exception.
(46) The defendant has argued that given the importance of the suspension for the first year of the plaintiffs call option, the redemption

<<<

 clause ought not to be interpreted in such a way as to create a loophole for the plaintiff.
The Tribunal agrees with this.
(47) Furthermore, it has been alleged that including the Transaction in the sense of a sale in the Agreement would render

<<<

 the suspension of the call option meaningless as "there would, in effect, be a call option at all times".
The Tribunal does not share this view.
The Bondholders and their trustee have knowingly accepted the Mandatory Redemption clause with

<<<

 a fairly wide definition of the Mandatory Prepayment Events. In all probability, they have done so in their own interest.
The Mandatory Prepayment Events are all significant events, that either eliminate the Issuer's need for a loan or change

<<<

 substantially the premises on which the loan was granted, see (33). The occurrance of these events could be said to override other clauses in the Agreement regulating the rights and duties o f the parties under more "normal" circumstances,

<<<

 including the Bondholders right to obtain a (high) interest on their loan.
The Tribunal sees its job not as plugging a loophole, but to interpret the Mandatory Redemption clause in such a way as to serve its purpose. This means that the concept

<<<

 of a rig "sale" should not be made wider than what is natural in order to consider it such a significant event as mentioned above.
(48) This is not to say that it is irrelevant whether there is a circumvention of the suspension of the call

<<<

 option or not.
The parties seem to agree that such a circumvention may exclude a purported sale from the Mandatory Redemption clause.
However, the Tribunal interprets "circumvention" in this respect as referring to a pro forma transfer, i.e

<<<

. a sale that is not really a sale, but only purports to be a sale.

16
The defendant does not contend that the Transaction was such a circumvention, but argues that the sale lacks some important features or characteristics that sales to "third

<<<

 parties" have. This difference, it is alleged, ought to exclude the Transaction from the Mandatory Prepayment Event definition of the Bond Agreement.
(49) As pointed out in (38) above, the Transaction is not an "inter-group transaction" as

<<<

 defined in clause 13.4.1.
This fact may be considered as an indication that transactions outside the scope of clause 13.4.1 do not particularly concern the Bondholders. It may even be argued that such transactions are "third party" transactions

<<<

.
On the other hand, as pointed out in (39) above, the Transaction seems to be a transaction between the Issuer and an "indirect shareholder th ereo f' under clause 13.4.2. Since this clause explicitly makes a distinction between such a transaction

<<<

 and "an arms' length transaction with a third party", it appears to be difficult to argue that the Transaction was a "third party" transaction under the Bond Agreement.
The actual requirements of 13.4.1 and 13.4.2 may be seen as relevant when

<<<

 evaluating the Transaction. The main requirement is the same, the transaction must be "on commercial terms".
(50) A sale is a transfer of ownership in exchange for a consideration.
It is not disputed that in this sense the rig was "sold" from

<<<

 the plaintiff to Marine Blue Ltd. on 29 October 2010. The sales agreement called "Drilling unit sale agreement" has been presented to the Tribunal, together with a certificate dated 1 November 2010 from the office o f the maritime administrator

<<<

 o f the Republic of the Marshall Island showing that Marine Blue Ltd. is the sole owner of the rig.
(51) The buyer Marine Blue Ltd. is a Gibraltar company owned by a Luxembourg company called RDC Drilling International S.a.r.l., which is owned

<<<

 partly by Rowan Companies Inc. (56.8 %) and partly by Atlantic Maritime Services Inc. (43.2 %). The latter is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rowan Comapnies Inc.
Ms. Trent, a vice president of Rowan Companies Inc., testified that Marine Blue

<<<

 Ltd. owns most o f the group's rigs, in total about 30 rigs.
The seller SKDP 1 Ltd. was owned by Rowan Drilling Norway AS, which was owned by a subsidiary of Marine Blue Ltd. called Rowan Drilling (Gibraltar) Ltd.
Consequently, the buyer was

<<<

 the "great-grandparent" of the seller.
(52) According to the evidence, the sale was a bona fide sale, i.e. a genuine sale. There is nothing to suggest that the Transaction was pro forma.
(53) In fact, there are indications that the possibility

<<<

 of avoiding the payment of interest subsequent to the repayment of the loan was not the main factor when the

17
sale was being decided. The Tribunal would like to point out that the two other rigs were sold as well, although the disputed

<<<

 interest was much lower. The figure corresponding to the USD 11,2 million in this case was only USD 500.000 with regard to the sale of rig No. 2.
(54) As have been pointed out in (49) above, the sale was not an "inter-group transaction" as

<<<

 defined i clause 13.4.1 of the Bond Agreement. The Tribunal finds this to be of significance.
On the other hand, as also pointed out in (49), the Transaction was not a "third party" transaction according to the Agreement, since it was a transaction

<<<

 with a company "affiliated" with the Issuer.
(55) The sale was on commercial terms, which is another o f the requirements put forward by the defendant. This is also the main requirement under clauses 13.4.1 and 13.4.2.
The sales price was arrived

<<<

 at through an evaluation of two independent experts, one of them being Ernst & Young.
(56) The defendant has also argued that an ordinary sale is irreversible or final.
The Tribunal considers this to be a problematic requirement. It would seem

<<<

 to exclude transactions in which there is an option to buy the asset back, even if the transaction otherwise is a genuine sale on commercial terms to a third party. The Tribunal is of the opinion that it would be very difficult to draw the

<<<

 line here.
Furthermore, it would be fairly easy to circumvent such a requirement.
Notwithstanding this, there is no evidence in this case to suggest that the Transaction is not final. Marine Blue Ltd. appears to be the natural owner of this

<<<

 rig in the Rowan group.
(57) Finally, the defendant has argued that the Issuer in this case had full control over when redemption would take place.
Although this is true in the sense that the Issuer could decide when to sell the rig and cause

<<<

 a redemption, this holds true with regard to any sale.
However, as pointed out in (33) above, there are two reasons why a sale should trigger a redemption:
(a) There is no longer any need for the loan. (b) The premises for obtaining and/or

<<<

 giving the loan have changed
substantially.
These reasons are valid in any sale, probably even inter-group sales.
As to (a) it should be commented that the buyer may not need the loan.

18
If he does, he can negotiate with the lenders to take

<<<

 over the loan. The Issuer has disposed of its sole asset of any value, and has no further use for the loan. In addition, it has the money to repay the loan from the sales proceeds.
As to (b) the sale poses an immediate and grave risk to the

<<<

 Bondholders. The buyer may have other assets and debts which may create uncertainty as to his ability to pay interest and eventually repay the loan. There may be other risks and problems as well.
The Tribunal can see no reason why this particular

<<<

 sale should be treated differently than other sales.
(58) It should be added that the Tribunal does not consider the sale of a rig to be a simple and inexpensive way to obtain redemption of a loan.
The transaction costs must be assumed to be

<<<

 of a considerable size, and there are other important factors to consider when contemplating to sell a major asset like a rig.
(59) It follows from the above that all the requirements of a "sale" put forward by the defendant are in fact on

<<<

 the whole complied with in this case.
The fact that the Redemption clause as such can override the high interest terms in the Agreement, cannot be helped. However, "sold" could have been defined so as to expressly exclude sales to "affiliated

<<<

" companies. The Bondholders did not propose this, and it is doubtful whether such a definition would have been in then interest. This would not have been so in cases where the buyer's financial situation was unsatisfactory.
(60) Furthermore

<<<

, the Tribunal considers it to be a major argument against the exclusion of certain "internal" sales from the "sale" definition, that it would seem very difficult to draw the line. This would, in turn, create uncertainty, which generally is

<<<

 negative in this type of agreements.
(61) At the very least such an exclusion ought to have a basis in the Agreement itself. In this case we have seen that the Transaction falls outside the Agreement's own "inter-group" definition, whereas

<<<

 it seems to fall under the definition of transactions with " affiliated" companies. Had the parties wanted such transactions to be excluded from the definition of a "sale", it would have been simple to refer to clauses 13.4.1 and/or 13.4.2

<<<

.
It should be added that neither clause 13.4.1- nor 13.4.2-transactions are prohibited, but there is a requirement that the sale must be on commercial terms. As this is the case here, this requirement in itself is no argument for excluding

<<<

 the Transaction from the definition of a "sale"
(62) The Tribunal finds further support for the conclusion that redemption is warranted in this case in the circumstance that the Issuer could have elected to ask

19
the Parent to sell its shares

<<<

 instead, which is one o f the two options in the Expected Transaction.
Or, the rig could have been sold together with one or more or all shares.
Such a sale of shares would seem to fall under the Redemption clause.
But then it would appear

<<<

 to be almost formalistic to base the award on a more or less accidental choice of way of transfer.
(63) Another argument put forward by the plaintiff is of a similar kind. It can be argued that in reality Marine Blue Ltd. acquired the rigs

<<<

 from SKDP in a two step-transaction. If the company had bought the rigs directly from the rig owning companies in the first place, this would undoubtedly have been "sales" according to the bond agreements.
It is quite clear that Rowan's purpose

<<<

 was to buy the rigs. In the NTB-message about the initial acquisition of shares in the Parent it is referred to a statement by the managing director of Rowan saying that they are happy for the possibility to "take over the three rigs".
The

<<<

 fact that the acquisition o f the rigs took place through the acquisition o f the shares in the Parent should not be decisive with regard to the major consequences of the acquisition.
(64) Both parties have argued that the Agreement should

<<<

 be interpreted against the other side, because the other party had possibility and reason to express himself more clearly.
This refers to the so-called "ambiguity rule".
This rule is in Norwegian law considered to be an auxiliary rule or a

<<<

 rule o f last resort if the process of interpretation does not produce a conclusive result.
This is not the case here, as the Tribunal have found that the Transaction under an objective interpretation was a "sale" under the Redemption clause

<<<

 and the pertaining definition of Mandatory Prepayment Events. Consequently, there is no occasion for the application of this rule.
Notwithstanding this, the Tribunal does not consider the auxiliary rule to be helpful in this case. On the one

<<<

 hand, the Issuer and its lawyers and other experts produced the Bond Agreement and thus did have the best possibilities to express itself clearly. On the other hand, the Bondholders and their trustee obviously had reason to see to it that the

<<<

 text of the Agreement, and particularly the Redemption clause, did not undermine the suspension of the call option the first year.

20

5 The costs of arbitration
(65) According to section 8 of the Arbitration Agreement
"The distribution between

<<<

 the parties o f the Tribunal's fees, the costs o f preparation and conduct o f the Arbitration and the parties' reasonable costs and expenses shall be determined by the Tribunal pursuant to Section 40 o f the Arbitration Act, provided, however

<<<

, that neither party shall be responsible for the other party's attorney costs except for Norwegian attorney costs up to a maximum amont o f NOK 1,000,000 (plus value added tax)."

(66) The said Section 40 of the Arbitration Act states that

<<<

 distribution of both the Tribunal's fees and expenses concerning the proceedings and the parties' own costs shall be in accordance with what the Tribunal finds "correct".

(67) The plaintiff has won the case completely, and the defendant has

<<<

 lost it completely.
The obvious consequence is that the defendant must pay the costs of the arbitration.
This is also the rule under the general Norwegian act of civil procedure, unless special circumstances exist. The Tribunal can see no such

<<<

 circumstances.

(68) The plaintiffs cost claim is in the amount of NOK 420,000 including VAT and travel expenses for the party representative and one witness. The legal fees are NOK 300,000 plus VAT.
The defendant has not objected to this claim

<<<

.
The Tribunal finds the costs necessary and reasonable.

(69) As to the fees o f the Tribunal, it should be pointed out that in an ordinary court case the losing party would also have to pay the court's fees as well as the fees of expert judges

<<<

.
According to clause 18.8 of the Bond Agreement all disputes shall be resolved "by the courts of Norway, with the District Court of Oslo as sole legal venue". Although the parties have decided to replace this procedure with arbitration, the

<<<

 Tribunal thinks it fair to look to the rules of distribution of costs in this alternative process.

(70) The fees of the Tribunal are as follows:

1) Kristian Huser (chairman) 2) Pål Sveinsson 3) Jo Stokke Total fees

NOK 400,000 NOK200,00

<<<

0 NOK200.000 NOK800.000

As part of the costs 14,1 % Employment Tax has to be paid, i.e. NOK 112,800.

21
In addition, there is rent for the premises in which the oral hearing took place, including lunch, in the amount o f NOK 7,540.
Thus,

<<<

 the total costs are NOK 920,340.
Each of the parties has paid a deposit of NOK 400,000. This deposit will be used to pay the Tribunal's fees.
Consequently, the defendant will have to repay the plaintiff NOK 400,000.
6 The Award of the Tribunal

<<<


(71) For the reasons given above the Tribunal renders the following award:
1. The Transaction constitutes a Mandatory Prepayment Event that would require and entitle SKDP 1 Ltd. to conduct a mandatory redemption o f the Outstanding Bonds in

<<<

 accordance with clause 10.4.1 of the Bond Agreement with Norsk Tillitsmann ASA upon completion of the Transaction.
2. SKDP 1 Ltd. is entitled to the entire Escrow Amount o f USD 11,200,000 which SKDP 1 Ltd. har deposited with Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 AS and the said Escrow Amount, together with interest accrued thereon, shall therefore immediately be released to SKDP 1 Ltd. by Norsk Tillitsmann ASA pursuant to the terms o f the Escrow Agreement (which forms a part o f the Arbitration Agreement

<<<

 dated 9 December 2010).3.
3. Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is to pay all costs to the Arbitration Tribunal, including the fees of the arbitrators and the costs otherwise related to the arbitration, in total NOK 920,340. This means that Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA is to (a) repay to SKDP 1 Ltd. the deposit of NOK 400,000, (b) pay NOK112,800 in Employment Tax on the fees of the Tribunal to the Norwegian tax authorities, and (c) pay NOK 7,540 in rent to Arntzen de Besche Advokatfirma AS. The payments

<<<

 are to be made by 14 calendar days following the award.
4. Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is to pay all costs to SKDP 1 Ltd. related to the arbitration, in the amount of NOK 420,000, by 14 days following the award.
(72) The Award is unanimous.
