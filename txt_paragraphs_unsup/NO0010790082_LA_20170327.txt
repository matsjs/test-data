PROMENADEN PROPERTY
RESTRUCTURING PAPER
27 MARCH 2017
PROMENADEN PROPERTY: REFINANCING OF THE CLASSIC TREND STRUCTURE
DRAFT  JANUARY/2017
1

INTRODUCTION

 The Promenaden company group is complex and includes dormant



<<<



intermediary holding companies, companies solely holding title to real

estate, general partnerships and a limited partnership. The complex

structure is mainly due to historical reasons and previous acquisitions.

 Based on the due diligence

<<<

 carried out in connection with the acquisition of Promenaden Property in 2015, a restructuring has been proposed by Promenaden Property to secure and perfect the legal title to the relevant properties, reduce costs and increase effectiveness

<<<

 within the Promenaden  group (the "Restructuring process").

 Thommessen has been engaged as legal advisor for Promenaden Property AS to propose a steps plan for the Restructuring process. A thorough assessment of the liquidity, tax and accounting

<<<

 effects of the restructuring was carried out in 2016 by PWC (liquidity) and BDO (tax and accounting). PWC and BDO's advise are reflected herein and BDO has on 27/03/17 confirmed that the relevant tax, VAT and accounting comments are reflected

<<<

 in each step.

 This memorandum sets out the proposed transaction steps for the

contemplated Restructuring process of the Promenaden Property group.

Thommessen does not provide advise on valuation nor financial or



accounting matters. Factual

<<<

 information set out or assumed herein is based

on information from Promenaden Property which we have not verified. For

an overview of the assets, rights and liabilities in the group as of 31/12/15,

please refer to BDO's memo. The overview

<<<

 should be updated based on the

2016 annual accounts for the companies involved.

 As a part of the Restructuring process we recommend that a light due



diligence is carried out in connection with the steps in which assets, rights

and/or

<<<

 obligations are transferred between group companies to secure that

all required consents, notices etc. are made pursuant to relevant agreements

and applicable law. We assume that such requirements may mainly relate to

leases, rental guarantees

<<<

, external debt (i.e. financing institutions). This

exercise should especially be made in respect of the existing bond loans.

 Generally, a debtor would need to inform the Nordic Trustee of a restructuring process, but it should not (depending

<<<

 on the terms of the bond) be required to call for a bond holder meeting to resolve on the matter. The notification should be made prior to the approval of the restructuring. [TBC whether consent is required.] Please let us know if Thommessen

<<<

 shall assist on this].

Please note that if the due diligence process and further analysis reveal that there are more cost or time efficient manners of implementing the Restructuring process, the various transactions under the Restructuring

<<<

 process may be subject to certain changes and amendments, provided always that such amendments do not entail adverse consequences with respect to taxation, liquidity positions etc. The proposed transactions may also be postponed due to commercial

<<<

, tax or VAT reasons.
The transactions proposed in this memorandum are in accordance with prevailing tax practice and previous advanced binding rulings issued by Norwegian tax authorities in similar cases and it is our view that the transactions

<<<

 can be carried out in accordance with the provisions in the Norwegian Tax Act (the "Tax Act") for tax exempt conversions and mergers. The companies involved in the Restructuring process should, however, provide supplementary information about

<<<

 the Restructuring process in a separate attachment to their tax return in order to avoid penalty taxes if the tax authorities challenge the positions taken and reassess the companies' tax assessment. To ensure 100% certainty that none of the

<<<

 transactions will be challenged by Norwegian tax authorities, an advanced binding ruling would need to be obtained before the transactions are resolved and implemented.
The transfer of property and title in relation to the proposed restructurings

<<<

 are exempt from stamp duty. If so called "capital goods" (i.e. capital expenditures related to real property and acquisition of certain type of operational assets) are transferred as part of the mergers or the conversions, VAT adjustment agreements

<<<

 should be entered into in accordance with the Act relating to value Added Tax (the "VAT Act").
As part of the Restructuring process it is proposed to adopt several mergers. The proposed mergers will not imply any immediate taxation in Norway

<<<

, provided that the mergers are implemented in accordance with the provisions for tax-exempt mergers pursuant to the Tax Act chapter 11. We do not foresee any reason why these transactions should not meet the requirements set out in the Tax

<<<

 Act chapter 11.

INTRODUCTION
(CONT.)
 It is further proposed to convert several of the Promenaden group's general partnerships into private limited liability companies. A general requirement for a tax exempt conversion is that the ANS

<<<

 is carrying out business activities for Norwegian tax purposes prior to the conversion. This will be analyzed further in connection with the light due diligence and before any of the relevant steps are taken.
 The conversions of the partnerships

<<<

 into limited liability companies must be implemented within 30/06 in the relevant year in order to be effective for tax purposes as of 01/01 the same year. If the conversions are implemented after 30/06, the conversions will be effective for

<<<

 tax purposes as of 01/01 the following year which will entail certain practical challenges as it would in such case be necessary to prepare two tax returns  one for the ANS and one for the new AS. The preparation of the tax returns would also

<<<

 be somewhat more technically complex, both for the company and the shareholders. This should be confirmed before the conversion is implemented.
 Please also note that a conversion of a partnership into limited liability company which owns real

<<<

 property subject to construction may entail adverse VAT consequences. The real property owned by Nedre Slottsgate 15 ANS is currently subject to construction, but our understanding is that the construction will be completed by 30/06/17 and

<<<

 that a VAT taxable tenant will have started to use the premises by the same date, so that the conversion can be implemented without adverse VAT consequences in 2017.

STEP 1
CONVERSION OF AKERSGATA 16 EIENDOM ANS TO AS, HFS VRE SLOTTSGATE 18/20 ANS TO AS AND NEDRE SLOTTSGATE 15 ANS TO AS (CONT.)

Description  (1

<<<

) Purchase of shelf companies: The shareholders in each of Akersgata 16
Eiendom ANS, HFS vre Slottsgate 18/20 ANS and Nedre Slottsgate 15 ANS (the "General Partnerships") purchase a shelf company (private limited liability company) in proportion

<<<

 to their ownership share in the General Partnerships. The new shelf companies will be "sister" companies of the General Partnerships.
 (2) Conversion: Conversion of the General Partnerships from general partnerships (ANS) to private limited

<<<

 liability companies (AS).
 As part of the conversion, all assets, rights and obligations of the General Partnerships including property and shares held by these, will be transferred to each of the new shelf companies, i.e. Akersgata 16 Eiendom

<<<

 AS, HFS vre Slottsgate 18/20 AS and Nedre Slottsgate 15 AS respectively.
 The General Partnerships will be put into liquidation as a part of the conversion.
 The conversion must be approved by the partners in each of the General Partnerships

<<<

 that are to be converted.
 Please note that the book equity of Akersgata 16 Eiendom ANS and Nedre Slottsgate 15 ANS is negative. Approximately NOK 10 million of Akersgata 16 Eiendom ANS' IC debt and NOK 62.3 million of Nedre Slottsgate 15 ANS

<<<

' IC debt (to Promenaden NewCo AS) must be converted into equity (immediately) prior to the conversion to an AS.
Timing  The purchase of the shelf companies and registration of change in
ownership etc. will normally take approx. 1 week.
 The

<<<

 inclusion of the new shelf companies in a VAT group takes normally 1-2 weeks.
 The conversion is implemented once the notification of the conversions are received and registered with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises.

 The notice

<<<

 to liquidate the General Partnerships with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises will initiate a six week creditor notice period.
Taxes and VAT  The purchase of the shelf companies will not entail any adverse tax
consequences.
 The

<<<

 conversion and the liquidation of the General Partnerships will not involve any immediate taxation in Norway, provided that the conversions are implemented in accordance with the provisions for tax exempt conversions in the Tax Act section

<<<

 11-20.
 A main condition for a tax exempt conversion is that the conversion is based on tax continuity (i.e. the tax positions related to all assets, liabilities etc. transferred from the ANS to the AS must be continued after the conversion

<<<

) and ownership continuity (i.e. no change in the ownership interests in the company). In addition, it is required that the ANS is carrying out business activities for Norwegian tax purposes prior to the conversion and that the ANS has a positive

<<<

 tax and book equity. If the ANS has negative book or tax equity it is necessary to inject equity into the ANS (capital increase, conversion of debt etc.) prior to the conversion. There should not be any trapped cash as a result of the capitalisation

<<<

 of the partnerships as such funds can be lent out to the other companies within the group. This has not been specifically assessed in the liquidity analysis, but should in any event not have any significant effects.
 The new shelf companies

<<<

 should be registered in the VAT register and included in the Promenaden Property Group's VAT group as soon as possible following the acquisition of the shelf companies. Please let us know if Thommessen shall assist on this.
 The transfer of

<<<

 assets, rights and obligations from the General Partnerships to the new "sister" companies, as part of the conversion, is exempted from VAT under the VAT Act. According to the VAT Act, the right to deduct input VAT on capital goods, (i.e. capital

<<<

 expenditures related to real property and acquisition of certain type of operational assets) shall be adjusted in the event of a change in use or transfer of the capital goods.

<<<

 SLOTTSGATE 18/20 ANS TO AS AND NEDRE SLOTTSGATE 15 ANS TO AS (CONT.)
Taxes and VAT (cont.)  Any VAT adjustment obligations related to capital goods transferred in
connection with the conversions, should be novated to the respective acquiring

<<<

 company pursuant to a VAT adjustment agreement between the transferring General Partnership and the respective acquiring company in accordance with the VAT Act section 9-3.
 As for Akersgata 16 Eiendom ANS and Nedre Slottsgate 15 ANS any VAT

<<<

 adjustment obligations should be novated to the respective new shelf company as intermediary recipient, and then to the respective company that finally holds the relevant property as the ultimate recipient of the capital goods (i.e. Promenaden

<<<

 Akersgata 16 AS and Promenaden NSG 13 AS respectively).
 Please note that a conversion of an ANS to an AS which owns real property currently subject to construction may entail adverse VAT consequences (as the transfer may result in an obligation

<<<

 to repay all deducted input VAT on costs related to the construction process, without an option to avoid such a repayment obligation by concluding a VAT adjustment agreement). The real property of Nedre Slottsgate 15 ANS is currently subject

<<<

 to construction which should be finalized by 30/06/17. Hence, the conversion should not have any adverse VAT consequences, provided that the construction work is finalized and that the VAT taxable tenant has started to use the premises by the

<<<

 time of conversion. [TBC]
Accounting  The conversion will be carried out with continuity for accounting purposes
pursuant to Norwegian GAAP. i.e. the transferred assets, rights and liabilities are continued based on their book values pursuant

<<<

 to Norwegian GAAP (and not IFRS) at group level.
Stamp duty  The transfer of legal title in connection with the tax exempt conversions are
exempt from stamp duty and will not trigger any registration fees.

TITLE COMPANY MERGERS
Description  Each of the companies only holding legal title to properties

<<<

, Dronningens
gate 15 Oslo AS, HSS Steen & Strm AS, HSS Karl Johans gate 16 AS and Akersgt 16 AS resolve to transfer their assets, rights and obligations as a whole to its respective parent company, i.e. Dronningensgate 15 Eiendom AS, High

<<<

 Street Shopping AS and Akersgata 16 Eiendom AS by way of parent/subsidiary mergers without consideration.
 As the Title Companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Property Companies, the mergers can be carried out in accordance with the

<<<

 simplified merger procedure provisions in section 13-23 of the Companies Act.
 The corporate decision of the merger is made through resolutions by the board of directors both in the Title Company and the Property Company.
 The Title Companies

<<<

 will be dissolved as a consequence of the merger.
Timing  The Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises must be notified of the
adoption of the mergers, by the acquiring and the transferring companies. The notification to the Register will

<<<

 initiate a six weeks creditor notice period.
 The mergers can be completed once the six weeks creditor notice period has expired (and any potential claims from the creditors are settled) and the implementation has been notified and registered

<<<

 with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprise.
 The merger between Akersgt 16 AS and Akersgata 16 Eiendom AS cannot be implemented until Akersgata 16 Eiendom ANS is converted to an AS in Step 1.
Third party consents etc.  We recommend

<<<

 that a light due diligence is carried out (please refer to
the introduction).
Taxes and VAT  The parent/subsidiary mergers will not imply any immediate taxation in
Norway, provided that the mergers are implemented in accordance with the provisions

<<<

 for tax-exempt mergers pursuant to the Tax Act chapter 11. A main condition for a tax exempt merger is that the merger is based on tax continuity (please refer to Step 1).

 The tax exempt merger has to be carried out between similar entities

<<<

 with the same type of liability. Akersgata 16 Eiendom ANS was converted into an AS in Step 1 and continuity of ownership is a precondition for a tax exempt conversion from ANS to AS. However, the Norwegian tax authorities have previously accepted

<<<

 mergers immediately after a conversion even when the merger entails a change in ownership, cf. BFU 105/03, and especially if the indirect ownership remains the same, cf. BFU 16/04. When Akersgata 16 Eiendom AS is merged with Promenaden Akersgata

<<<

 16 AS the direct ownership of the company will change, but Promenaden NewCo AS will remain the indirect 100% owner.
 A transfer of assets, rights and obligations as part of a merger is exempted from VAT under the VAT Act. If capital goods are

<<<

 transferred in connection with any of the mergers, the relevant transferring companies will be obligated to adjust (repay) a proportional share of deducted input VAT on the capital goods, unless the transferring companies transfer their VAT

<<<

 adjustment obligation to the relevant acquiring company in the merger pursuant to a VAT adjustment agreement in accordance with the VAT Act section 9-3 (please refer to Step 1). The acquiring company in the merger must be registered in the

<<<

 VAT register no later than by the end of the deadline for the VAT term when the completion of the merger is registered in the Norwegian Register for Business Enterprises. Please let us know if Thommessen shall assist on this.
 Any VAT adjustment

<<<

 obligations transferred in the Parent/subsidiary mergers in Step 5 between Akersgata 16 Eiendom AS and Promenaden Akersgata 16 AS should be novated to the latter in a VAT adjustment agreement.
Accounting  The mergers will be carried out with

<<<

 group continuity for accounting
purposes pursuant to Norwegian GAAP.
Registration of title and stamp duty  The acquiring companies should be registered as the new title holders of
the respective properties following the mergers.
 Transfer of

<<<

 legal titles in connection with mergers are exempt from stamp duty and will not trigger any registration fees.

 MERGERS

Description  In order to simplify the structure the following intermediary holding
companies, dormant companies and property companies holding title (wholly-owned subsidiaries) can be merged into their respective parent companies:

<<<


 Prinsen Invest AS  Promenaden Grensen 17 AS  Promenaden vre Slottsgate 18-20 AS  Promenaden Nedre Slottsgate 23 AS  Kirkegaten 20 Eiendom AS  Tollbugaten 17 Eiendom AS  Akersgaten 16 Eiendom AS
 The wholly-owned subsidiaries resolve to transfer

<<<

 their assets, rights and obligations as a whole to their respective parent company by way of parent/subsidiary merger without consideration, in accordance with the simplified merger procedure provisions in section 13-23 of the Companies Act

<<<

, cf. Step 2.
 The wholly-owned subsidiaries will be dissolved as a consequence of the mergers. Following the mergers, HFS vre Slottsgate 18/20 AS, Nedre Slottgate 15 AS and Prinsegaarden AS will be wholly-owned by Promenaden NewCo AS.
 According

<<<

 to the 2015 Financial Statements, the book equity of Promenaden NewCo AS, Promenaden Nedre Slottgate 23 AS and Prinsen Invest AS is negative (respectively NOK [881 156], NOK [2 504 406], and NOK [1 999 993] as of 31/12/15). However, a parent

<<<

/subsidiary merger without consideration can be carried out even though the subsidiary and/or the parent company has negative book equity.
Timing  The Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises must be notified of the
adoption of the merger

<<<

, by both the acquiring and transferring company. The notification to the Register will initiate a six weeks creditor notice period.
 The merger can be completed once the six weeks creditor notice period has expired (and any potential claims

<<<

 from the creditors are settled) and the implementation has been notified and registered with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprise.

Third party consents etc.  We recommend that a light due diligence is carried out (please refer to

<<<


the introduction).
Taxes and VAT  The merger will not imply any immediate taxation in Norway, provided
that the merger is implemented in accordance with the provisions for tax-exempt mergers in the Tax Act chapter 11, cf. Step 2.
 The mergers

<<<

 cannot be implementation until HFS vre Slottsgate 18/20 ANS and Nedre Slottsgate 15 ANS are converted to AS' in Step 2, as an ANS is legally required to have at least two partners.
 Tollbugaten 17 Eiendom AS and Kirkegaten 20 Eiendom AS hold

<<<

 certain tax positions (i.e. deferred tax liability) which will be transferred to Promenaden Egertorget AS under the mergers. Based on previous advanced binding rulings issued by the tax authorities, cf. BFU 61/06, the transfer should be acceptable

<<<

 by the tax authorities as Tollbugaten 17 Eiendom AS and Kirkegaten 20 Eiendom AS are currently in the same tax group as the acquiring company, Promenaden Egertorget AS, and Promenaden Property AS, and consequently already in a position to set

<<<

 off the deferred tax liability against carried forward tax losses within the Promenaden group through group contributions.
 The transfer of assets, rights and obligations in connection with the mergers will not trigger any VAT liabilities,

<<<

 provided that the transferred assets only consist in cash balances.
 Any VAT adjustment obligations transferred through the merger between Akersgata 16 Eiendom AS and Promenaden Akersgata 16 AS should be novated to the latter under a VAT adjustment

<<<

 agreement (please refer to Step 1 and 2).
Accounting  The mergers will be carried out with group continuity for accounting
purposes pursuant to Norwegian GAAP.
Registration of title and stamp duty  Promenaden Akersgata will be registered as

<<<

 the new title holders of the
respective properties acquired under the merger. As both the title and the property are transferred in the same transaction, legal protection will be established.
 Transfer of legal titles in connection with mergers

<<<

 are exempt from stamp duty and will not trigger any registration fees.
