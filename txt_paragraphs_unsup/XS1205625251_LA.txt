Risk Factors
The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Capital Securities. Most of these factors are contingencies

<<<

 which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring.
In addition, factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with Capital

<<<

 Securities are also described below.
The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in Capital Securities, but the inability of the Issuer to pay interest, principal or other amounts

<<<

 on or in connection with any Capital Securities may occur for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available to it or which it may not currently be able to anticipate. Prospective

<<<

 investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.
Factors that may affect the issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Capital

<<<

 Securities
The changes to the overall economy in the Group's principal markets could have a significant adverse effect on Group's businesses and profitability. The economy in the Group's principal markets has been adversely affected since 

<<<

2009 by a significant slowdown, with a direct impact on electricity demand. At the same time new production capacity - in particular from renewable energy sources - has been added. This has led to an oversupply resulting in falling wholesale

<<<

 electricity prices and pressure on production margins, especially for gas fired plants. This could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the

<<<

 Capital Securities.
Financial risk
Electricity price risk Electricity prices are affected by fundamental factors such as supply (including water levels and available generation and transmission capacity), demand (electricity use, which in turn

<<<

 is affected by the weather and the economy), fuel prices and the price of CO2 emission allowances. The Group hedges its electricity generation and electricity sales through the use of physical and financial forward contracts and long-term customer

<<<

 contracts. Sensitivity analysis reflects the impact that variations in market prices can have on the Group's operating profit. The Group continuously hedges its exposure against the price of electricity and other commodities in the various

<<<

 markets. These exposures are monitored daily. The long-term customer contracts pertain to time horizons in which there is no possibility to hedge prices in the liquid part of the futures market and stretch as far as to 2024. The total hedged

<<<

 volume for the period of 2017-2024 is 57 TWh, where most is hedged in the beginning of the period, with volumes falling over time. The amount of future electricity generation that is to be hedged within the given mandates is decided by the

<<<

 Group's risk committee and is confirmed by the Group's board. To measure electricity price risk, the Group uses methods such as "Value at Risk" and "Gross Margin at Risk" along with various stress tests. If the Group incorrectly hedges its

<<<

 electricity price risk or if the Group fails to hedge its electricity price and electricity sales adequately, this could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments

<<<

 in respect of the Capital Securities.
4

Fuel Price Risk Fuel price risk is minimised through analysis of the various commodity markets and diversification of contracts with respect to price model and terms. Regarding hard coal-fired and gas

<<<

-fired electricity generation, hedges on electricity and fuel prices are coordinated to ensure a set fuel cost and gross margin on the electricity generation. For lignite-fired plants, there is no fuel price risk, since the Group owns the lignite

<<<

 mines. The price risk for uranium is limited, since uranium accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total cost of nuclear power generation. If the Group fails to mitigate its fuel price risk adequately, particularly in respect of

<<<

 hard coal-fired and gas-fired electricity generation, this could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Volume risk In

<<<

 hydro power generation, volume risk is managed by analysing and forecasting factors such as precipitation and snowmelt. Volume risk also arises in sales activities as deviations in anticipated versus actual volumes delivered to customers. If

<<<

 the Group's analysis or forecast proves to be incorrect or if the Group fails to mitigate its volume risk adequately, this could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make

<<<

 payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Credit risk Credit risk arises in the Group's commodities trading, sales, treasury operations and investments. The Group's credit risk management involves analyses of the Group's counterparties

<<<

, reporting of credit risk exposure and proposals for risk mitigation measures (such as by obtaining collateral). If the Group's credit analysis proves to be incorrect or if its system to mitigate credit risk proves inadequate, this could adversely

<<<

 affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the risk of not being able to pursue the price hedging

<<<

 strategy, for example, due to insufficient liquidity in the electricity and fuel markets. This risk is managed through so-called proxy hedging and by securing an optimal number of trading counterparties. Liquidity risk also pertains to the

<<<

 risk of the Group not being able to finance its capital needs. Liquidity risk is mitigated by having several types of debt issuance programmes and credit facilities, which ensure access to capital and flexibility. The Group is committed to

<<<

 maintaining financial stability. If the Group were unable to execute its strategy to mitigate liquidity risk, for example if there were a lack of trading counterparties or a lack of diversified sources of financing, this could adversely affect

<<<

 the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Interest rate risk The Group quantifies interest rate risk in its debt portfolio in terms of duration

<<<

, which describes the average term of fixed interest rates. The norm is to have a duration of three years with a permissible variation of +/one year. The norm duration is based on the Group's current financing needs and the desired interest

<<<

 rate sensitivity in net interest income/expense. The duration of the Group's debt portfolio as at 31 December 2014 was 2.8 years (in comparison to 2.9 years as at 31 December 2013) including hybrid capital. If the Group fails to successfully

<<<

 implement its strategy to mitigate its interest rate risk, it may be particularly sensitive to any interest rate volatility or have a less efficient financing structure in place and this could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings

<<<

 and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
5

Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk through exchange rate movements attributable to future cash flows (transaction

<<<

 exposure) and in the revaluation of net assets in foreign subsidiaries (translation or balance sheet exposure). The Group has limited transaction exposure, since most generation, distribution and sales of electricity take place in the respective

<<<

 local markets. Sensitivity to currency movements is therefore also relatively low. The business units are required to hedge all contracted transaction exposure in another currency when it exceeds the equivalent of SEK 10 million. The hedge

<<<

 is to be taken out immediately in connection with the transaction and is done through Staff Function Group Treasury. The goal for hedging translation exposure is to, over time, match the currency composition in the debt portfolio with the currency

<<<

 composition of the Group's funds from operations over time. The Group's largest exposure is in EUR. If the Group fails to adequately mitigate its currency risk, this could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position

<<<

 and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Operational risk In the course of its operations, the Group is exposed to a range of operational risks, such as in plants, infrastructure, personnel

<<<

 and organisation. These risks are described below.
Operational asset risk The Group's largest operational asset risks are associated with the operation of power generation and heat production plants. An important part of the continuous risk

<<<

 management work involves a rolling inspection programme and continuous control of plant conditions to ensure effective maintenance.
Nuclear power safety and dam safety are also areas entailing operational asset risks and are special focus areas

<<<

 for the Group's Safety and Risk Committee. The Group's Chief Nuclear Safety Officer is responsible for overseeing nuclear power safety at the Group level.
Risks associated with operational assets concern not only electricity generation but

<<<

 also damage to machinery, such as at the Group's open cast lignite mines, and damage to distribution networks.
If there were an operational failure in respect of the power plants or dams or if the Group fails to mitigate such operational risk

<<<

 adequately, this could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Security risks As part of the Group's business, the Group

<<<

 deals with various technology (whether in respect of energy production or distribution) but also sensitive personnel and client information. As such, the Group works with loss prevention and mitigating security measures to protect the Group

<<<

's assets, IT systems, information, personnel and continuing operations. The Group ensures that assets and information are protected from improprieties and fraud, amongst other things by adherence to the "four eyes" principle, whereby decisions

<<<

 must be approved by at least two persons unless special exceptions exist. If the Group fails to mitigate such security risk adequately, this could result in a loss of business or client liability and this could adversely affect the Group's

<<<

 business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Supplier risk Supplier risk refers to the risk of interruptions in delivery by suppliers or deficiencies in

<<<

 codes of conduct for suppliers. To mitigate this risk the Group applies its code of conduct for suppliers and performs risk assessments and audits of suppliers. Interruptions in supply could adversely affect the Group's business,
6

earnings

<<<

 and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Personnel risk There are certain higher risks involved in certain aspects of work in the energy sector both as to personnel but

<<<

 also possible consequent effect in the wider society. As such, the Group ensures that it has preventive measures in place and adopts best health and safety practices. The Group's production sites maintain a high level of safety procedures to

<<<

 ensure the safety of both employees and society in general. If the Group fails to mitigate such personnel risk adequately this could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability

<<<

 to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Legal risk The Group's business operates in the private but also the public domain, ranging from private contracts with suppliers to the supply of energy to the general public, and it is

<<<

 thereby exposed to legal risks across a wider area. The Group mitigates such legal risks by engaging Staff Function Legal Affairs as the central legal hub to deal with the legal aspects of ongoing business activities and decision-making processes

<<<

. The Group's General Counsel also regularly reports on ongoing disputes to the Board of Directors. If the Group fails to mitigate such legal risk adequately, the Group may become exposed to legal liabilities which could adversely affect the

<<<

 Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Tax Risk Management of tax-related risk is part of the Group's risk management process. The Group has

<<<

 a policy for tax risks, which has been adopted by the Risk Committee and describes the ethical framework for handling tax issues. The Group's Head of Tax reports on the Group's tax position on a regular basis and quarterly to the CFO as well

<<<

 as bi-annually in a compiled report to the Audit Committee. If the Group fails to mitigate such tax risk adequately, the Group may become exposed to tax liabilities which could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position

<<<

 and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Strategic risk The Group is exposed to a range of different factors affecting the energy sector that are difficult to influence, including the risk for

<<<

 changes in political policies, public opinion, regulations and choice of technology (medium- to long-term). To manage strategic risk, the Group works with scenario analyses and business intelligence activities as well as diversification of

<<<

 risk in the generation and distribution portfolios with respect to markets and also sources of energy. If the Group incorrectly anticipates the various factors and fails to mitigate such risks adequately, this could adversely affect the Group

<<<

's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Political risk To protect itself from political risks which can have a significant impact on the energy sector

<<<

 as it is generally more highly regulated, the Group conducts active business intelligence. In addition, the Group belongs to various national and international trade organisations in order to promote the Group's interests. If government or

<<<

 public policies or regulations change to the detriment of the Group, this could adversely affect the Group's business, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities

<<<

.
7

Investment risk The Group is a highly capital-intensive business with an extensive investment programme. The Group applies a very thorough project governance process in which risk assessment is an integrated part. Before every investment

<<<

 decision, the risk unit performs an independent review of obligations and transactions. In addition to a strategic investment roadmap, a detailed five-year plan of investment projects is updated yearly to provide the Executive Group Management

<<<

 with guidance and updates in the investment decision process. If the Group incorrectly manages or plans its capital investment programme or is unable to fund its capital investment programme, this could adversely affect the Group's business

<<<

, earnings and financial position and may impact the Issuer's ability to make payments in respect of the Capital Securities.
Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the Capital Securities
The

<<<

 Capital Securities may not be a suitable investment for all investors The Capital Securities are complex financial instruments. Each potential investor in the Capital Securities must determine the suitability of that investment in light of

<<<

 its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should consider, either on its own or with the help of its financial and other professional advisers, whether it:
(i) has sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful

<<<

 evaluation of the relevant Capital Securities, the merits and risks of investing in the relevant Capital Securities and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;
(ii) has access

<<<

 to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the relevant Capital Securities and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio

<<<

;
(iii) has sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the relevant Capital Securities, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the currency in which such

<<<

 investor's financial activities are principally denominated;
(iv) understands thoroughly the terms of the relevant Capital Securities and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant financial markets; and
(v) is able to evaluate possible

<<<

 scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership

<<<

 and disposition of the Capital Securities.
Risks related to the Capital Securities generally Set out below is a brief description of certain risks relating to the Capital Securities generally:
The Conditions contain provisions which may permit

<<<

 their modification without the consent of all investors and confer significant discretions on the Trustee which may be exercised without the consent of the Holders and without regard to the individual interests of particular Holders The Conditions

<<<

 contain provisions for calling meetings of Holders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Holders including Holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting

<<<

 and Holders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
The Conditions also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of Holders and without regard to the interests of particular Holders agree to any modification of, or to the waiver

<<<

 or authorisation of any breach or
8

proposed breach of, any of the Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed which, in the opinion of the Trustee, is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Holders. In addition, the

<<<

 Trustee may, without the consent of the Holders, agree with the Issuer to the substitution in place of the Issuer as the principal debtor under the Capital Securities of certain entities described in Condition 15, subject to, inter alia, the

<<<

 Trustee being satisfied that the interests of the Holders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution and certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed being complied with, all as more fully described in Condition 15 and the

<<<

 Trust Deed.
Withholding under the EU Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the "Savings Directive") on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities

<<<

 of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar income) paid or secured by a person established within its jurisdiction to (or secured by such a person for the benefit of) an individual resident in that other Member State

<<<

 or to (or secured for) certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Austria is instead required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system

<<<

 in relation to such payments subject to a procedure whereby, on meeting certain conditions, the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that no tax be withheld (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon

<<<

 the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of

<<<

 Switzerland).
The Council of the European Union formally adopted a Council Directive amending the Savings Directive on 24 March 2014 (the "Amending Directive"). The Amending Directive broadens the scope of the requirements described above.

<<<

 Member States have until 1 January 2016 to adopt the national legislation necessary to comply with the Amending Directive and are required to apply the new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes made under the Amending Directive include

<<<

 extending the scope of the Savings Directive to payments made to, (or secured) for, certain other entities and legal arrangements. They also expand the range of payments covered by the Savings Directive, in particular to include additional

<<<

 types of income payable on securities, and the circumstances in which payments must be reported or paid subject to withholding.
If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an

<<<

 amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment pursuant to the Savings Directive or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive, neither the Issuer, any Paying Agent 

<<<

(as defined in the Conditions) nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Capital Security as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. Furthermore, once the Amending Directive is implemented

<<<

 and takes effect in EU Member States, such withholding may occur in a wider range of circumstances than at present, as explained above. The Issuer is required to maintain a Paying Agent in a Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct

<<<

 tax pursuant to the Savings Directive or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to such directive. However, prospective holders should be aware that any custodians or intermediaries through which they hold

<<<

 their interest in the Capital Securities may nonetheless be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to such laws unless the prospective holder meets certain conditions, including providing any information that may be necessary to enable

<<<

 such persons to make payments free from withholding and in compliance with the Savings Directive, as amended.
U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Withholding In certain circumstances payments made on or with respect to the Capital Securities

<<<

 after 31 December 2016 (at the earliest) may be subject to U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
9

Revenue Code (commonly referred to as "FATCA"). Whilst the Capital Securities are in global form and held

<<<

 within the clearing systems, in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not expected that FATCA will affect the amount of any payment received by the clearing systems. However, FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries

<<<

 in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of FATCA withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a financial

<<<

 institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment) with any information, forms,

<<<

 other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or agreements

<<<

 related to FATCA), and provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding. Investors should

<<<

 consult their own tax adviser to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer's obligations under the Capital Securities are discharged once it has paid the common depositary for the clearing systems

<<<

 (as bearer of the Capital Securities) and the Issuer has therefore no responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the clearing systems and custodians or intermediaries. Further, foreign financial institutions in a jurisdiction

<<<

 which has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States pursuant to FATCA (an "IGA") are generally not expected to be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) from payments they make on

<<<

 securities such as the Capital Securities. For more information, see "Taxation - Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act".
Investors who purchase Capital Securities in denominations that are not an integral multiple in excess of 100,000 or SEK1

<<<

,000,000 (as applicable) may be adversely affected if definitive Capital Securities are subsequently required to be issued It is possible that the Capital Securities may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples in excess of the 

<<<

100,000 or SEK1,000,000 (as applicable) minimum denomination (the "Minimum Denomination"). In such a case a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than the Minimum Denomination in his/her account with

<<<

 the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a definitive Capital Security in respect of such holding (should definitive Capital Securities be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Capital Securities

<<<

 such that its holding amounts to the relevant Minimum Denomination.
If definitive Capital Securities are issued, Holders should be aware that definitive Capital Securities which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple in excess

<<<

 of the Minimum Denomination may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Risks related to the market generally Set out below is a brief description of the principal market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk and legal risk:
An active

<<<

 secondary market in respect of the Capital Securities may never be established or may be illiquid and this would adversely affect the value at which an investor could sell his Capital Securities The Capital Securities may have no established

<<<

 trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Capital Securities in the secondary market (in which case the market or trading price

<<<

 and liquidity may be adversely affected) or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market.
10

The value of the Capital Securities depends on a number of economic, financial

<<<

 and political factors The value of the Capital Securities depends on a number of interrelated factors, including economic, financial and political events in Sweden or elsewhere, including factors affecting capital markets generally and the

<<<

 stock exchanges on which the Capital Securities are traded. The price at which a Holder will be able to sell the Capital Securities prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be substantial, from the issue price or the purchase price

<<<

 paid by such Holder.
If an investor holds Capital Securities which are not denominated in the investor's home currency, he will be exposed to movements in exchange rates adversely affecting the value of his/her holding. In addition, the imposition

<<<

 of exchange controls in relation to any Capital Securities could result in an investor not receiving payments on those Capital Securities The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the NC7 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities and the NC7

<<<

 Floating Rate Capital Securities in Swedish krona and on the NC12 Capital Securities in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency

<<<

 unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than euro or, as the case may be, Swedish krona. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the euro or Swedish krona or revaluation of

<<<

 the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the euro or Swedish krona, as

<<<

 the case may be, would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Capital Securities, (2) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Capital Securities and (3) the Investor's Currencyequivalent

<<<

 market value of the Capital Securities.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Issuer to make payments in

<<<

 respect of the Capital Securities. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments The investment activities of certain

<<<

 investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (1) Capital Securities are legal

<<<

 investments for it, (2) Capital Securities can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Capital Securities. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers

<<<

 or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Capital Securities under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.
Credit ratings assigned to the Issuer or the Capital Securities may affect the market value

<<<

 of the Capital Securities and may not reflect all the risks associated with an investment in the Capital Securities The Capital Securities have been assigned a rating by S&P and Moody's. The rating granted by each of S&P and Moody's or any

<<<

 other rating assigned to the Capital Securities may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market and other factors that may affect the value of the Capital Securities. A credit rating is not a recommendation to

<<<

 buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.
In addition, each of S&P and Moody's or any other rating agency may change its methodologies or their application for rating securities

<<<

 with features similar to the Capital Securities in the future. This may include the relationship between ratings assigned to an issuer's senior securities and ratings assigned to securities with features similar to the Capital Securities, sometimes

<<<

 called "notching". If the rating agencies were to change
11

their practices or their application for rating such securities in the future and the ratings of the Capital Securities were to be subsequently lowered, this may have a negative

<<<

 impact on the trading price of the Capital Securities.
CRA Regulation In general, European regulated investors are restricted under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (as amended) (the "CRA Regulation") from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes

<<<

, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances

<<<

 whilst the registration application is pending). Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit ratings issued by non-EU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating

<<<

 agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered and certified rating

<<<

 agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority ("ESMA") on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be

<<<

 delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the updated ESMA list.
The value of the Capital Securities could be adversely affected by a change in English or Swedish law or

<<<

 administrative practice
The Conditions are based on and governed by English law (other than the Conditions relating to subordination of the Capital Securities, which are based on and governed by Swedish law). No assurance can be given as to

<<<

 the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of England and Wales or Sweden or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus. Furthermore, the Issuer operates in a heavily regulated environment and has to comply

<<<

 with extensive regulations in Sweden and elsewhere. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to laws or administrative practices after the date of this Prospectus.
Risks related to the structure

<<<

 of the Capital Securities
The Capital Securities are subordinated obligations; accordingly, claims in respect of the Capital Securities would rank junior to claims in respect of unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer in the event of an Issuer

<<<

 Winding-up The Capital Securities are direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer, ranking behind claims of unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer and creditors of the Issuer in respect of all Subordinated Indebtedness (as

<<<

 defined in the Conditions), pari passu without any preference among themselves and with any present and future outstanding Parity Securities of the Issuer (as defined in the Conditions) and in priority to payments to holders of all classes

<<<

 of share capital of the Issuer in their capacity as such holders.
In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation (likvidation), bankruptcy (konkurs) or company reconstruction (fretagsrekonstruktion) of the Issuer (each an "Issuer

<<<

 Winding-up"), Holders will only be eligible to recover any amounts in respect of their Capital Securities if all claims in respect of more seniorranking obligations of the Issuer have first been paid in full. If, on an Issuer Winding-up, the

<<<

 assets of the Issuer are insufficient to repay the claims of all senior-ranking creditors in full, the Holders will lose their entire investment in the Capital Securities. If there are sufficient assets to repay the claims of senior-ranking

<<<

 creditors in full but insufficient assets to enable it to pay claims in respect of the Capital Securities and all other obligations of the Issuer ranking pari passu with the Capital Securities, Holders will lose some (which may be substantially

<<<

 all) of their investment in the Capital Securities.
12

Furthermore, subject to applicable law, no Holder may exercise, claim or plead any right of set-off, compensation or retention in respect of any amount owed to it by the Issuer in respect

<<<

 of, or arising under or in connection with, the Capital Securities and each Holder shall, by virtue of his/her holding, be deemed to have waived all such rights of set-off, compensation or retention.
In addition, if the financial condition

<<<

 of the Issuer deteriorates such that Issuer Winding-up may be anticipated, the market price of the Capital Securities can be expected to fall, and such fall may be significant. A Holder that sells its Capital Securities in such an event may

<<<

 lose some or substantially all of its initial investment in the Capital Securities (whether or not an Issuer Winding-up subsequently occurs).
The Capital Securities are long-term securities and therefore an investment in Capital Securities

<<<

 constitutes a financial risk for a long period Unless the same have been earlier redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the NC7 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities will be redeemed on 19 March 2077, the NC7 Floating Rate Capital Securities will

<<<

 be redeemed on the Interest Payment Date falling in March 2077 and the NC12 Capital Securities will be redeemed on 19 March 2077. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Capital Securities at any time before these dates and Holders

<<<

 have no right to call for redemption of the Capital Securities.
Therefore, prospective investors should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Capital Securities for a long period and may not

<<<

 recover their investment before the end of this period.
The Issuer may defer interest payments at its discretion The Issuer may, at any time and in its sole discretion, elect to defer payment of all (but not some only) of the interest which

<<<

 would otherwise be paid on any Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Conditions), and the Issuer shall not have any obligation to make such payment and any failure to pay shall not constitute a default by the Issuer for any purpose.
Any

<<<

 interest not paid on an applicable Interest Payment Date and deferred shall constitute Deferred Interest and shall be paid in whole, but not in part, at any time, at the option of the Issuer or on the occurrence of a Deferred Interest Payment

<<<

 Event, as defined in the Conditions.
Any deferral of interest payments will be likely to have an adverse effect on the market price of the Capital Securities. In addition, as a result of such interest deferral provisions of the Capital Securities

<<<

, the market price of the Capital Securities may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to the above provisions and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in

<<<

 the Issuer's financial condition.
The Issuer may redeem the Capital Securities early; investors should consider reinvestment risk The Issuer will have the right to redeem the NC7 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities in whole, but not in part

<<<

, on the NC7 Fixed Rate Reset First Reset Date or any Interest Payment Date thereafter, will have the right to redeem the NC7 Floating Rate Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, on the NC7 Floating Rate First Call Date or any Interest

<<<

 Payment Date thereafter, and will have the right to redeem the NC12 Capital Securities on the NC12 First Reset and Step-up Date or any Interest Payment Date thereafter, in each case at their principal amount together with any Deferred Interest

<<<

 and any other accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of redemption.
The Issuer may also, at its option, redeem the NC7 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, the NC7 Floating Rate Capital Securities

<<<

 in whole, but not in part, and/or the NC12 Capital Securities in whole, but not in part, upon the occurrence of a Tax Deductibility Event, a Rating Event, a Withholding Tax
13

Event or a Substantial Repurchase Event with respect to the relevant

<<<

 Capital Securities, as further described in the Conditions.
In the case of a Tax Deductibility Event or a Rating Event, such redemption will be at (i) 101 per cent. of the principal amount of the relevant Capital Securities, where such redemption

<<<

 occurs (in the case of the NC7 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities) before the NC7 Fixed Rate Reset First Reset Date, (in the case of the NC7 Floating Rate Capital Securities) before the NC7 Floating Rate First Call Date or (in the case of

<<<

 the NC12 Capital Securities) before the NC12 First Reset and Step-up Date, or (ii) 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the relevant Capital Securities, where such redemption occurs on or after the relevant date specified in (i) above,

<<<

 together in each case with any Deferred Interest and any other accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the redemption date.
In the case of a Withholding Tax Event or a Substantial Repurchase Event, such redemption will be at 100 per

<<<

 cent. of the principal amount of the relevant Capital Securities, together with any Deferred Interest and any other accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the redemption date.
During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem

<<<

 the Capital Securities, the market value of the Capital Securities generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed.
The Issuer might redeem the Capital Securities when its cost of borrowing is lower than

<<<

 the interest rate on the Capital Securities. There can be no assurance that, at the relevant time, Holders will be able to reinvest the amounts received upon redemption at a rate that will provide the same return as their investment in the

<<<

 Capital Securities. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
Substitution or variation of the Capital Securities There is a risk that, after the issue of the Capital Securities

<<<

, a Tax Deductibility Event, a Rating Event or a Withholding Tax Event may occur which would entitle the Issuer, without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Holders, to substitute the relevant Capital Securities for, or vary the

<<<

 terms of the relevant Capital Securities so that they become or remain, Qualifying Capital Securities (as defined in the Conditions).
Whilst Qualifying Capital Securities are required to have terms which are not materially less favourable to

<<<

 Holders than the terms of the relevant Capital Securities (as reasonably determined by the Issuer in consultation with an independent investment bank, independent financial adviser or legal counsel of international standing), there can be no

<<<

 assurance that the Qualifying Capital Securities will not have a significant adverse impact on the price of, and/or the market for, the Capital Securities.
Fixed rate securities have a market risk The NC7 Fixed Rate Reset Capital Securities

<<<

 and the NC12 Capital Securities will bear interest at a fixed rate, each reset by reference to a mid-swap rate plus a margin on the first reset date for the relevant Capital Securities and on each fifth anniversary of such first reset date

<<<

. A holder of a security with a fixed interest rate is exposed to the risk that the price of such security falls as a result of changes in the current interest rate on the capital market (the "Market Interest Rate"). While the nominal interest

<<<

 rate of a security with a fixed interest rate is fixed during the life of such security or during a certain period of time, the Market Interest Rate typically changes on a daily basis. A change of the Market Interest Rate cause the price of

<<<

 such security to change. If the Market Interest Rate increases, the price of such security typically falls. If the Market Interest Rate falls, the price of a security with a fixed interest rate typically increases. Potential investors should

<<<

 be aware that movements of the Market Interest Rate can adversely affect the price of the Capital Securities and can lead to losses for the Holders if they sell the Capital Securities.
14

Each reset interest rate may be different from the

<<<

 initial interest rate of the relevant Capital Securities and may adversely affect the yield of such Capital Securities.
Floating rate securities may suffer a decline in interest rate The NC7 Floating Rate Capital Securities will bear interest

<<<

 at a floating rate, set by reference to a 3-month interbank offered rate plus a margin. A holder of a security with a floating interest rate is exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income. Fluctuating

<<<

 interest rate levels make it impossible to determine the yield of such securities in advance. Each reset interest rate may be different from the initial interest rate of the NC7 Floating Rate Capital Securities and may adversely affect the

<<<

 yield of the NC7 Floating Rate Capital Securities.
Holders of the Perpetual Capital Securities have very limited rights in relation to the enforcement of payments on the Capital Securities If a default is made by the Issuer for a period of

<<<

 30 days or more in relation to the payment of any interest, principal or premium in respect of the Capital Securities which is due and payable, the rights of the Trustee (failing which, the Holders) in respect of the Capital Securities are

<<<

 limited to instituting proceedings for an Issuer Winding-up, and the Trustee (failing which, the Holders) may prove and/or claim in respect of the Capital Securities in an Issuer Winding-up. Whilst the claims of the Holders in an Issuer Winding

<<<

-up are for the principal amount of their Capital Securities together with any Deferred Interest and any other accrued and unpaid interest, such claims will be subordinated as provided above under "The Capital Securities are subordinated obligations

<<<

; accordingly, claims in respect of the Capital Securities would rank junior to claims in respect of unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer in the event of an Issuer Winding-up". Neither the Trustee nor the Holders shall be entitled to accelerate

<<<

 payments of interest or principal under the Capital Securities in any circumstances outside an Issuer Winding-up. Furthermore, whilst the Trustee may institute other proceedings against the Issuer to enforce the terms of the Capital Securities

<<<

, the Issuer shall not, by virtue of such proceedings, be obliged to pay any sum or sums sooner than the same would otherwise have been payable by it. The Trustee shall not be bound to take any enforcement action in respect of the Capital Securities

<<<

 unless so instructed by defined majorities of the Holders and subject to certain Trustee protections. Furthermore, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action directly against the Issuer in respect of the Capital Securities unless

<<<

 the Trustee has become bound to act and fails to do so within a reasonable time. Accordingly, the Holders' rights of enforcement in respect of payments under the Capital Securities are very limited.
No limitation on issuing or guaranteeing

<<<

 debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Capital Securities There is no restriction in the Conditions on the amount of debt which the Issuer may issue or guarantee. The Issuer and its Subsidiaries and affiliates may incur additional indebtedness

<<<

 or grant guarantees in respect of indebtedness or guarantees of third parties, including indebtedness that ranks pari passu with or senior to the Capital Securities. The issue of any such securities or the incurrence of any such other liabilities

<<<

 may reduce the amount (if any) recoverable by Holders on an Issuer Winding-up and/or may increase the likelihood of a deferral of interest payments under the relevant Capital Securities.

Interest deferral The Issuer

<<<

 may, at any time and at its sole discretion, by giving notice to the Holders not less than seven Business Days before the relevant Interest Payment Date, elect to defer any interest, in whole but not in part, which is otherwise scheduled to

<<<

 be paid on an Interest Payment Date (except for interest payable upon maturity or redemption of the Capital Securities). No default If the Issuer makes such an election to defer interest, the Issuer shall have no obligation to make such payment

<<<

 on the relevant Interest Payment Date and any such non-payment of interest on such date shall not constitute a default by the Issuer or any other breach of obligations under the Capital Securities or the Trust Deed. Deferred Interest Any interest

<<<

 in respect of the Capital Securities which has not been paid at the election of the Issuer in accordance with this paragraph will be deferred and such deferred interest shall itself bear interest at the rate of interest prevailing from time

<<<

 to time (which interest shall compound on each Interest Payment Date) and, for so long as the same remains unpaid, such deferred interest (including interest accrued thereon) shall constitute "Deferred Interest".
Optional settlement Deferred

<<<

 Interest may be paid (in whole but not in part) at any time at the option of the Issuer upon not less than seven Business Days' notice to the Holders.

18

Mandatory settlement The Issuer shall pay any Deferred Interest, in whole but not in

<<<

 part, on the first to occur of the following dates: (i) the 10th Business Day following the date on which a Deferred
Interest Payment Event occurs; (ii) any Interest Payment Date in respect of which the Issuer does
not elect to defer all of

<<<

 the interest accrued in respect of the relevant interest period; and (iii) the date on which the Capital Securities are redeemed or repaid. A "Deferred Interest Payment Event" means any one or more of the following events: (a) declaration or

<<<

 payment of any distribution or dividend or any other payment made by the Issuer on its share capital or by the Issuer or any subsidiary of the Issuer, as the case may be, on any Parity Securities; (b) redemption, repurchase, repayment, cancellation

<<<

, reduction or other acquisition by the Issuer or any subsidiary of the Issuer of any shares of the Issuer; (c) redemption, repurchase, repayment, cancellation, reduction or other acquisition by the Issuer or any subsidiary of the Issuer of

 any Parity Securities, save for: (i) in each case, any compulsory distribution, dividend, other payment, redemption, repurchase, repayment, cancellation, reduction or other acquisition required by the terms of such securities or by mandatory

<<<

 operation of applicable law; (ii) in the case of (b) above only, the redemption, repurchase, repayment, cancellation, reduction or other acquisition is executed in connection with, or for the purpose of (1) any reduction of the quota value

 of the share capital of the Issuer without a corresponding return of cash, capital or assets to shareholders of the Issuer or (2) any share buyback programme then in force and duly approved by the shareholders' general meeting of the Issuer

(d) Calculation of Initial Interest Amount
The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after the Interest Determination

<<<

The Issuer may, with the prior written approval of the Trustee, from time to time replace the Calculation Agent with another independent financial institution. If the Calculation Agent is unable or unwilling to continue

<<<

 to act as the Calculation Agent or fails to determine a Reset Interest Rate or calculate the related Interest Amount or effect the required publication thereof (in each case as required pursuant to these Conditions), the Issuer shall forthwith

<<<

 appoint another independent financial institution approved in writing by the Trustee to act as such in its place. The Calculation Agent may not resign its duties or be removed without a successor having been appointed as aforesaid. If the Issuer

<<<

 fails to appoint a successor Calculation Agent approved by the Trustee in a timely manner, then the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to appoint as its successor a reputable financial institution of good standing which the Issuer and the

 Sweden; or

 Euro Mid-Swap Rate for such Reset Period, all as determined by the Calculation Agent (each a "Reset Interest Rate").
(e) Determination of Reset Interest Rates and Calculation of Interest Amounts
The Calculation Agent shall, at or as soon as

<<<

 practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Central European time) on each Reset Interest Determination Date, determine the Reset Interest Rate in respect of the Reset Period commencing immediately following such Reset Interest Determination Date and shall

<<<

 Interest Amounts
Unless the Capital Securities are to be redeemed, the Issuer shall cause notice of each Reset Interest Rate and the related Interest Amount to be given to the Trustee, the Paying Agents, any stock exchange on which the Capital

<<<

 Reset Period.

67

pursuant to these Conditions), the Issuer

<<<

<<<

 such substitution or variation, would expose the Trustee to any liability or impose, in the Trustee's opinion, more onerous obligations upon it. If the Trustee does not participate or assist as provided above, the Issuer may redeem the Capital

Description of The Group
Overview
General and History With effect from 1 January 1992 the Swedish State

<<<

 Power Board, Statens Vattenfallsverk, was converted from a public utility into a limited liability company registered in Stockholm under registration number 5560362138, having been established under the name Vattenfall Aktiebolag in November

<<<

 1990. The national highvoltage grid (together with its international connections) which was part of Statens Vattenfallsverk's operations, was not transferred but was demerged and incorporated into a new public utility, Svenska Kraftnt. The

<<<

 Issuer's registered office is at Stockholm, Sweden and the telephone number is +46 8 739 50 00. With effect from 1 January 1995, the Issuer became a public limited company.
Group vision and operations The Issuer's mission, from its owner, is

<<<

 to generate a market rate of return by operating an energy business that enables the Issuer to be among the leaders in developing environmentally sustainable energy production. The Group's main products are electricity, heat and gas. In electricity

<<<

 and heat, the Group works in all parts of the value chain: generation, distribution and sales. In gas, the Group is active in sales, trading and gas-storage. The Group is also engaged in energy trading and lignite mining. The Group has approximately

<<<

 30,180 employees. The Issuer is the parent company of the Group and is 100 per cent. owned by the Swedish state. The Issuer's activities are conducted on a commercial basis with the Swedish state's involvement limited to the role of a shareholder

<<<

. Operations in 2014 were conducted in Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, France, and the United Kingdom (the "UK").
The Group's operations consist largely of production of electricity and heat; lignite mining; distribution

<<<

 of electricity and heat; and sales of electricity, gas and heat, each of which involves slightly varying business models.
Production of electricity and heat is conducted with various types of energy sources as input. Electricity and heat production

<<<

 are competitive businesses, and the marginal cost per produced unit is the most important competitive factor.
Distribution of electricity is a regulated and legally unbundled business where revenue frameworks are set by the regulators, which

<<<

 are intended to cover investment costs and allow a reasonable return on invested capital. Distribution of heat (district heating) is not a regulated business but has characteristics similar to electricity distribution.
Sales of electricity

<<<

, gas and heat are competitive business, where price and product are the key competitive factors. Add-on services, such as energy efficiency solutions and other advice on sustainable energy, are becoming an increasingly important competitive

<<<

 factor. The new energy landscape is opening a new market for customer-centric services, as many customers are seeking to become more active as consumers and increasingly also want to become electricity producers themselves.
Electricity generation

<<<

 Electricity generation decreased by 4.8 per cent. to 172.9 TWh in 2014 (181.7 TWh in 2013). Hydro power generation also decreased slightly during the year. Nordic reservoirs were filled slightly below normal levels at the end of 2014. Electricity

<<<

 generation from the Group's nuclear power plants and coal- and gas-fired power plants decreased as well. Nuclear power generation decreased slightly by 3.9 per cent. due to a higher number of outage days in 2014 compared to 2013. Fossil-based

<<<

 power generation (lignite, coal and gas) decreased by 5.7 per cent. in 2014 mainly due to the sale of the Amager combined heat and power station in
92

Denmark and lower production from combined heat and power plants as a result of warmer

<<<

 weather. The Group's electricity generation from wind power increased by 5.1 per cent in 2014.
Sales of electricity, heat and gas Total sales of electricity to end customers decreased slightly in 2014 to 199.0 TWh from 203.3 TWh in 2013. Sales

<<<

 of heat decreased in 2014 by 20.5 per cent from 30.3 TWh in 2013 to 24.1 TWh. Sales of gas decreased by 10.3 TWh to 45.5 TWh in 2014. Sales of electricity, heat and gas decreased as a result of warmer weather.
Strategy The Group's overarching

<<<

 strategy is focused on shifting its portfolio towards more sustainable energy production and strengthening its customer focus. At the same time, the Group should be able to generate a market rate of return for the owner and be a long-term financially

<<<

 stable company. The Group - like many other major European power utilities  is currently facing major challenges and is in the process of adapting to changed market conditions. Its large-scale electricity generation must be adapted to a market

<<<

 characterised by weak demand and considerably lower electricity prices than before. The energy mix must be restructured towards more renewable energy, and costs must be lowered along the entire value chain. The Group must find new financing

<<<

 solutions to be able to increase its investments in renewable energy - mainly wind power. Rising demand from customers and society for new, sustainable products and services must also be met. The Group's strategy for the years ahead is focused

<<<

 on the following points:  strengthening customer focus and developing new customer-centric models;  accelerating the transformation towards more sustainable and flexible generation models; and  continuing to focus on financial discipline and

<<<

 increased capital efficiency. A review of the Group's strategic direction is currently ongoing.
New organisational structure The Group plans to adopt a new organisational structure with effect as of 1 April 2015. In this new structure six cross

<<<

-borders business areas will replace the existing regional structure. These six business areas are Heat, Wind, Customers & Solutions, Generation, Markets and Distribution. German lignite operations will be governed in a separate unit, Mining

<<<

 & Generation. See "Group Governance, Organisation and Business Structure  Organisation and Business Structure" for further details.
Investment plan for 2015-2016 The Group plans to invest a total of SEK 41 billion during 2015 and 2016, of

<<<

 which SEK 30.8 billion (or 75 per cent.), pertains to investments in electricity and heat production. The Group plans to invest the remainder, SEK 10.2 billion, primarily in electricity and heating networks. Of the investments in electricity

<<<

 and heat production, SEK 11.1 billion or 36 per cent. will be directed to growth investments, i.e., expansion of production capacity. The biggest share of growth investments, SEK 9.1 billion or 82 per cent., is planned for investment in renewable

<<<

 energy generation, mainly wind power.
Group Governance, Organisation and Business Structure
Corporate Governance Corporate governance in the Group is based on numerous external and internal rules and regulations.
93

External rules and regulations

<<<

:  Swedish and foreign legal rules, particularly the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Annual
Accounts Act;
 The Swedish state's ownership policy;
 The Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the "Code"). Any deviations that the Issuer makes

<<<

 from the Code are mainly due to the fact that the Issuer is 100 per cent. owned by the Swedish state, while the Code is written primarily for listed companies with broad ownership;
 Stock exchange rules. The Issuer adheres to the stock exchange

<<<

 rules that apply for companies that have fixed-income securities registered on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm and rules that apply for other marketplaces in which the Issuer has securities registered;
 International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS

<<<

) and other accounting rules; and
 Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) guidelines G4.
Internal rules and regulations:  The Articles of Association;
 The Board's Rules of Procedure, including the Chief Executive Officer's ("CEO") instructions

<<<

 on reporting to the Board; and
 Internal documents, particularly the Vattenfall Management System ("VMS"), which includes the Issuer's Code of Conduct and instructions on roles and responsibilities, and on the delegation of duties.
General

<<<

 on the Corporate Governance; the AGM: The Issuer is the parent company of the Group, and is a Swedish public limited liability company with its registered office in Solna. The Swedish Companies Act therefore applies to the Issuer, which entails

<<<

 that a company must have a board of directors that is elected by the owner at the Annual General Meeting ("AGM"). The AGM decides the content of the Issuer's Articles of Association and elects auditors (based on the proposal of the owner),

<<<

 adopts the income statement and balance sheet, grants discharge from liability and deals with other matters of business that are incumbent upon the AGM pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act or the Issuer's Articles of Association. Under Swedish

<<<

 law, the AGM will be held within six months after the end of each financial year. The Board, in turn, appoints the President and CEO, who is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Issuer in accordance with the Board's guidelines

<<<

 and instructions. Large parts of the Group's operations are conducted in wholly and partly owned subsidiaries.
The Board of Directors: For enterprises that are wholly owned by the Swedish state and that are not listed on a stock market, uniform

<<<

 and joint principles for a structured nomination process are applied to the members of the board. These principles take the place of the Code's rules on proposal decisions for the nomination of board members and auditors. The principles state

<<<

 that the process for nominating directors is co-ordinated by the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation.
The Issuer's Articles of Association stipulate that the Board shall have a minimum of five and a maximum of ten AGM-elected directors without

<<<

 deputies. The Chairman of the Board shall be elected by the AGM. In accordance with the Swedish state's ownership policy, the Group's CEO is not a director on the Board. The matters reserved for the Board are prescribed primarily by the Swedish

<<<

 Companies Act and the Board's Rules of Procedure. Each year the Board adopts its Rules of Procedure and a number of instructions. The Rules of Procedure and instructions regulate matters such as reporting to the Board, the delegation of duties

<<<

 between
94

the Board, the CEO and the Board's committees, the Chairman's duties, the form of board meetings, and evaluation of the work of the Board and the CEO. The Board's Rules of Procedure stipulate, among other things, that the Board

<<<

 shall approve major investments, acquisitions and divestments, and adopt central policies and instructions. The Board shall also approve certain important contracts, including contracts between the Group and the CEO, and between the Group and

<<<

 the Deputy CEO and such other persons in the Group who are defined as senior executives by the AGM. The Board's duties pertain to the Issuer as well as the Group. The Chairman leads the work of the Board in accordance with the Swedish Companies

<<<

 Act and the Code, and is responsible for - among other things - ensuring that the board members receive relevant information, making contact with the owner on ownership matters, and conveying views from the owner to the Board.
Directors' compensation

<<<

 and fees for committee work are set by the owner at the AGM, in accordance with the Swedish state's ownership policy.
The Board's Rules of Procedure stipulate that eight to twelve regular meetings are to be held each year. In addition to the

<<<

 regular meetings, the Board is summoned to further meetings if the need arises. The Rules of Procedure stipulate, among other things, that the following items are to be included on the agenda once a year:
 Strategic plan, business plan, investment

<<<

 plan and communication plan;
 Risk mandate and risk policy;
 Strategic personnel issues; and
 Annual report and quarterly reports.
In addition, a report is presented at every regular meeting on important business events since the previous meeting

<<<

, the financing situation, reports from board committees and matters that are not handled by the CEO in the day-to-day administration. The Board evaluates its own work and the CEO's work once a year in the aim of improving the Board's processes

<<<

 and effectiveness.
The Board sets the overall risk mandates for the Group in the areas of energy and commodity trading, as well as for financial, insurance and credit risks. At each board meeting, the Board receives information about the Group

<<<

's financial position.
Board committees: The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee, a Safety and Risk Committee and a Committee on External Relations and Ethics, and has drawn up rules of procedure for each of them

<<<

. At the statutory board meeting, the Board appointed three directors elected at a general meeting for each committee, one of whom serves as committee chair. In addition, the Board can, where necessary, establish other board committees or temporary

<<<

 work groups to address matters in more defined areas.
The committees report on their work to the Board at the next regular board meeting, where the committee chair presents the report accompanied by minutes of the committee meeting. Except

<<<

 for minor issues considered by the Audit Committee, the committees are only drafting bodies. The Board's legal responsibility under company law for the Issuer's organisation and administration of the Issuer's affairs is not constrained by the

<<<

 committees' work.
The Audit Committee is amongst other things, responsible for meeting with the Group's external and internal auditors on a regular basis in order to stay informed about the planning, focus and scope of the Issuer 's audit.

<<<

 The Audit Committee is also responsible for discussing coordination of the external and internal audit work and views of the Issuer's risks. The Audit Committee has the right, on behalf of the Board, to decide on
95

 other than auditing that the Group may procure from the Group's auditors. The internal audit's budget, the Internal Audit Charter and the internal audit plan are decided on by the Board. The Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and the Head of Internal

<<<

 Audit serve in a reporting role on the Audit Committee.
Internal governance, auditors: The President of the Issuer, who is also CEO of the Group, is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Issuer in accordance with the Swedish

<<<

 Companies Act. The CEO has appointed decision-making bodies for governance of the Group and makes decisions independently or with the support of these decision-making bodies. The most important of these decision-making bodies is the Executive

<<<

 Group Management ("EGM") and the Vattenfall Risk Committee ("VRC"). The EGM focuses on the Group's overall direction and decides within the framework of the CEO's mandate from the Board of Directors - on matters of importance for the Group

<<<

, such as certain investments. The VRC makes decisions pertaining to, among other things, the risk mandate and credit limits, and exercises oversight of the risk management framework. Both the EGM and the VRC conduct preparatory drafting work

<<<

 on matters that are to be decided by the Board of Directors. No member of the EGM is also a director of the Board.
The Swedish state's ownership policy states that responsibility for the election of auditors of state-owned companies shall always

<<<

 rest with the owner by decision of the AGM. The Issuer's Articles of Association stipulate that the Issuer shall have one or two auditors with or without one or two deputy auditors, or a chartered auditing firm as auditor. In accordance with

<<<

 the Act on Auditing of State Activities, the Swedish National Audit Office may appoint one or more auditors to participate in the annual audit.
The Issuer's Code of Conduct outlines eight principles in the areas of Health and Safety, People

<<<

, Customers and Suppliers, Business Ethics, Communication, Information Security, Company Resources and the Environment. Information about the Code of Conduct is provided on the Issuer's intranet, through articles in the Group's employee news

<<<

 magazine, and in connection with new hiring and training. These measures have helped make employees more familiar with the Code of Conduct. It also includes clear references to the VMS, which more clearly elaborates on the stipulations of the

<<<

 Code of Conduct. The VMS is the framework that ensures that the Issuer's governance adheres to formal requirements as well as to requirements made by the Board, the CEO, the business operations and the Staff Functions. The VMS is documented

<<<

 in binding governance documents consisting of policies, instructions and process documents on three different levels: company level, function level and business level. The VMS is an integrated management system that applies to the entire Group

<<<

, along with the limitations that may arise from legal requirements, such as regarding the unbundling of the electricity distribution business.
Organisation and Business Structure In 2014 the organisational structure for the Group was split

<<<

 into two regions, Nordic and Continental/UK. Asset Optimisation and Trading was operating as a cross regional unit. The Staff Functions were organised at company, region and business unit levels, and were complemented by service units. This

<<<

 will continue to be the organisational structure for 2015 until the new organisation structure described below is adopted.
On 15 January 2015 the Group announced a new organisational structure for the Group. The new structure is planned to

<<<

 take effect 1 April 2015. In this new structure six cross-borders business areas will replace the existing regional structure. These six business areas are Heat, Wind, Customers & Solutions, Generation, Markets and Distribution. German lignite

<<<

 operations will be governed in a separate unit, Mining & Generation. This new structure is intended to put additional focus on actual business as well as on cross border synergies.
Extensive work is being carried out until April 2015 on preparing

<<<

 for the implementation of the new organisational structure which is shown in the table below.
96

Staff functions and Shared Service Centres A number of Group-wide Staff Functions support the Group's business as well as the decision-making

<<<

 process of the EGM and CEO. The Staff Functions also govern relevant business processes in the Group as a whole. The Staff Functions are managed and co-ordinated centrally with employees located at both the management level and closer to the

<<<

 business. Shared Service Centres ("SSCs") are an important and integral element of the Group's business operations and focus on transaction-related processes. SSCs are led with a focus on process efficiency and utilisation of economies of scale

<<<

. SSCs provide services and specialist functions which, from a cost perspective, are advantageous to handle and perform on a shared basis.
Insurance cover
The Group protects itself against economic loss to the greatest extent possible through

<<<

 insurance. The Group has two Group-owned (captive) insurance companies that insure the Group's own risks exclusively; Vattenfall Insurance and Vattenfall Reinsurance. Vattenfall Insurance optimises the risk financing of insurable risks within

<<<

 the Group. Reinsurance is procured in the international reinsurance market. Vattenfall Reinsurance provides Vattenfall Insurance with some reinsurance capacity. Vattenfall Insurance underwrites insurance for most of the Group's property and

<<<

 business interruption exposure as well as for construction risks. Most of the power lines in the distribution networks are uninsured. This is due to the difficulty of finding cost-effective insurance solutions. In addition, Vattenfall Insurance

<<<

 provides Group-wide, general liability insurance, including consultant and product liability.
With respect to dam liability, Swedish dam owners have strict and unlimited liability for damage to third parties caused by dam accidents. In co-operation

<<<

 with other Nordic dam owners, the Group procures dam liability insurance with an insured amount of SEK 8.7 billion. Property insurance for the Group's nuclear power plants is issued by the European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance,

<<<

 and for the Swedish nuclear power plants, also by the Nordic Nuclear Insurers. Nuclear liability in Sweden is strict and limited to 300 million Special Drawing Rights (approximately SEK 3.5 billion) which means that owners of nuclear power

<<<

 plants are liable for damage up to this amount. Statutory nuclear liability insurance is issued by the
97

Nordic Nuclear Insurers and by the mutual insurance company, European Liability Insurance for the Nuclear Industry. In Germany, nuclear

<<<

 liability is strict and unlimited. By law, nuclear power plants are required to have insurance or other financial guarantees for up to EUR 2.5 billion. The German Atomic Insurance Pool issues insurance for up to EUR 256 million, which is complemented

<<<

 up to EUR 2.5 billion by a solidarity agreement (Solidarvereinbarung) between the parent companies of the German nuclear operators (Vattenfall GmbH, E.ON, RWE and EnBW). Each party accepts liability vis--vis the other parties in proportion

<<<

 to the respective ownership interest the parent companies have in the nuclear power plant. Since the liability is unlimited, the nuclear power plants and their German parent companies are ultimately liable also for amounts in excess of this

<<<

 level.
Pensions
The Group's pension obligations in the Swedish, German and Dutch companies are predominantly defined benefit pension obligations. The concerned pension plans are primarily retirement pensions, disability pensions and family

<<<

 pensions. The assets in these funds (the "Plan Assets") are reported at fair value. There are also pension plans in these and other countries that are defined contribution plans.
Swedish pension plans The Swedish pension plans supplement the

<<<

 Swedish social insurance system and are the result of agreements between employer and employee organisations. Almost all of the Group's employees in Sweden are covered by a pension plan that is primarily a defined benefit plan, known as ITP

<<<

-Vattenfall. This pension plan guarantees employees a pension based on a percentage of their salary. These benefits are secured through provisions on the balance sheet.
Certain of the Group's obligations in ITP-Vattenfall (such as spousal benefits

<<<

 and disability pensions) are secured through an insurance policy from Alecta (a Swedish mutual insurance company). According to a statement (UFR 3) issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, this plan is a multi-employer defined benefit

<<<

 plan. As in previous years, the Group has not had access to such information to make it possible to report this plan as a defined benefit plan.
German pension plans The pension plans in Germany are based on collective agreements in line with

<<<

 market terms and conditions. Substantial defined benefit plans exist in Germany. Two pension plans exist, both secured through Pensionskasse der Bewag, a mutual insurance company. Obligations are secured through funds paid in the Group and

<<<

 its employees. One plan has been classified as a defined contribution plan and is reported as such since the benefit is based on paid-in contributions and Pensionskasse der Bewag's financial position. For employees who began their employment

<<<

 before 1 January 1984, there is a supplementary agreement providing employees working until retirement age with a pension equal to up to 80 per cent. of the salary on which the pension is based. Half of the statutory pension and the entire

<<<

 benefit from Pensionskasse der Bewag, including profits, are credited to the guaranteed amount. Vattenfall GmbH Berlin's obligations encompass the entire pension obligation. The Plan Assets attributable to personnel employed since before 1

<<<

 January 1984 are reported as Plan Assets at fair value. The assets of the Pensionskasse are investment funds that are not listed on the stock exchange. The fair value is determined by the repurchase price. In addition the Group has pension

<<<

 obligations for employees in Hamburg that mainly comprise the Issuer's obligations to personnel employed before 1 April 1991 and who have been employed for at least 10 years. The sum of the retirement pension, statutory pension and pensions

<<<

 from third parties normally amounts to a maximum of 65 per cent. of pensionable salary.
98

Dutch pension plans In the Netherlands, the Group has the majority of its pension obligations secured through the ABP pension fund and the "Metaal

<<<

 en Techniek" pension fund. In 2013 an amendment was made in IAS 19 - Employee Benefits with regards to the classification requirements for pension plans. This amendment has resulted in a change in classification of the multi-employer plans

<<<

 in the Netherlands from defined benefit to defined contribution. The change in classification does not impact the financial performance of the Group as these plans were already accounted for as defined contribution plans in earlier years under

<<<

 the multi-employer scheme exemption. The ABP and "Metaal en Techniek" plans are thus, as of 2013, classified and reported as defined contribution plans.
The Group's pension provision was SEK 45.3 billion at year end 2014 (compared to SEK 3

<<<

5.5 billion in 2013). The total pension costs in 2014 were SEK 2.7 billion (compared to SEK 2.7 billion in 2013).
Recent activities
In January 2014, the Group completed the sale of the Amager combined heat and power station in Denmark to the

<<<

 Danish municipal-owned company HOFOR. The enterprise value was DKK 2 billion.
In January 2014, the Group sold its minority interest (corresponding to 18.67 per cent. of the shares) in the Polish energy company Enea S.A., for approximately SEK

<<<

 2.2 billion
In February 2014. the Group completed the sale of its majority interest of 74.9 per cent. in the electricity grid company Stromnetz Hamburg GmbH to the City of Hamburg. The purchase price was preliminarily set at EUR 550 million

<<<

 for 100 per cent. of the company. An external appraisal company will determine the final value of the company, which at a minimum can amount to EUR 495 million. The sale resulted in a capital gain of approximately SEK 3 billion. In addition

<<<

 to the purchase price, the City of Hamburg repaid a loan of approximately SEK 2.1 billion to the Group. The City of Hamburg has an option to buy the Group's majority shareholding of 74.9 per cent. in the district heating company Vattenfall

<<<

 Wrme Hamburg GmbH in 2019.
In February 2014, the Group completed the sale of its German engineering business Vattenfall Europe Power Consultant GmbH (VPC) to the investment company Palero Capital GmbH. The sales price has not been publicly

<<<

 disclosed.
In April 2014, the Group sold its 94 per cent. shareholding in Kalix Vrmeverk AB to Vasa Vrmeverk AB. The heating plant has annual heat production of 120 GWh. The sales price has not been publicly disclosed.
During the second quarter

<<<

 of 2014, the Group lowered the discount rate it uses to calculate provisions for future expenses for nuclear power and the mining operations in Germany. In addition, during the second and fourth quarters, the Group lowered the discount rate

<<<

 it uses to calculate pension provisions in Sweden and Germany. Together these measures led to an increase in adjusted net debt by SEK 15 billion. Cash flow and the underlying operating profit were not affected.
In May 2014, the Group's largest

<<<

 onshore wind farm in southern Sweden, Hjuleberg (36 MW), was inaugurated. The Hjuleberg wind farm comprises 12 wind turbines that can generate electricity equivalent to the consumption of more than 18,000 homes. The total investment sum was

<<<

 SEK 500 million.
In May 2014, construction was started on the new Berlin-Lichterfelde gas-fired combined heat and power plant, which will replace an older facility. The power plant will have capacity of 300MW electricity and 230 MW heat, and

<<<

 is expected to be commissioned at the end of 2016.
In June 2014, the Group acquired the Rimojokk power plant, a small run-of-river hydro power plant on the Lule River, from the company Picab. Through this acquisition the Group now owns all

<<<

 of the hydro power plants on the Lule River. The purchase price has not been publicly disclosed.
99

During the third quarter of 2014, the Group recognised impairment losses of SEK 23.1 billion for asset values as a result of continued deteriorating

<<<

 market conditions. Profit after tax was charged with SEK 19.9 billion. The Group's cash flow and net debt were not affected by the impairment losses. Geographically, the impairment losses are broken down into SEK 13.8 billion in the Netherlands

<<<

, SEK 6.9 billion in Germany, SEK 1.4 billion in the Nordic countries, and SEK 1.0 billion in the UK.
In August 2014, the Group decided to proceed with construction of the Sandbank offshore wind farm (288 MW) just west of the existing DanTysk

<<<

 wind farm. Sandbank will comprise 72 wind turbines and is expected to be commissioned in 2017. Like DanTysk, the Group owns 51 per cent. of Sandbank, with Stadtwerke Mnchen owning the remaining 49 per cent. The combined investment sum is approximately

<<<

 SEK 11 billion.
In September 2014, the Group sold its 85.5 per cent. majority shareholding in Mllverwertung Borsigstrae GmbH, a waste incineration plant in Hamburg, to the city's waste management company. The sales price was EUR 67 million

<<<

.
In September 2014, the Group decided to build an additional two onshore wind farms in Sweden: Juktan (29 MW), in northern Sweden, will comprise nine wind turbines, and Hge Vg (38 MW), in southern Sweden, will comprise 18 turbines. The combined

<<<

 investment sum is SEK 860 million. The wind farms are expected to be commissioned at the end of 2015.
In September 2014, the Group established three fast-charging stations for electric vehicles in Stockholm. The charging stations are the first

<<<

 in its new fast-charging network in Stockholm and Uppsala, which at year-end had been expanded to seven stations. In Berlin, the Group also installed two fast-charging stations as part of the "Schnell-Laden Berlin" project.
On 1 October 20

<<<

14, Magnus Hall took office as the Group's new President and CEO.
In October 2014, the Group signed an agreement to sell - via the subsidiary N.V. Nuon Energy - its combined heat and power assets in Utrecht to the Dutch energy company Eneco

<<<

. The sale was completed on 1 January 2015. The agreement covers Nuon's district heating network in Utrecht and the Lage Weide and Merwedekanaal CHP stations. The sale price has not been publicly disclosed.
In October 2014, the Group announced

<<<

 that various alternatives for a new ownership structure for the lignite mining operations in Germany are being looked into. The goal is to shift the production portfolio towards more renewable production and reduce the CO2 emissions of the

<<<

 Group. The Group's intention to continue running the Group's other operations in Germany, including district heating, distribution, sales, trading, wind power and other types of power generation, is unchanged.
In November 2014, the Group decided

<<<

 to build another wind farm, Hgabjr-Krss (38 MW), east of Falkenberg. It comprises 12 wind turbines and is expected to be commissioned at the end of 2015. The aggregate investment sum is approximately SEK 500 million.
In November 2014, the

<<<

 Group decided to sell its facility services business in Germany to ISS Facility Services GmbH. In conjunction with this, the Group signed a five-year agreement with the buyer for facility management services. The sale affects slightly more

<<<

 than 500 employees. The sales price has not been publicly disclosed.
In early December 2014, the DanTysk offshore wind farm (288 MW) in Germany began delivering electricity. The wind farm comprises 80 wind turbines and can generate 1.3 TWh

<<<

 of electricity per year. In July 2014 an historic milestone was passed at DanTysk, when the Group installed its 1,000th wind turbine.
In December 2014, the Group announced that, in partnership with the insurance and banking company Skandia

<<<

, it will be investing approximately SEK 2 billion to build four new wind farms in Sweden with a combined capacity of 141 MW. The plants will be run by a jointly owned company. The four wind farm
100

projects are Hjuleberg (36 MW), Hge Vg

<<<

 (38 MW), Juktan (29 MW) and Hgabjr-Krss (38 MW). The first of these is already in operation and has been transferred to the jointly owned holding company as per 1 January 2015. The other three wind farms are being built by the Group and

<<<

 will be transferred to the jointly owned company during the first quarter of 2016. This marks the first time that a Swedish financial investor is directly financing the construction of new wind power. The partnership will enable faster expansion

<<<

 of wind power for the Group.
In December 2014, the Group announced that the Danish district heating company Fjernverme Fyn would be acquiring the Fyn combined heat and power station in Denmark as well as a waste incineration plant. The enterprise

<<<

 value was DKK 1.1 billion, corresponding to approximately SEK 1.4 billion. The combined investment sum is DKK 600 million in cash consideration, corresponding to SEK 760 million. In addition, the buyer is taking over the decommissioning obligations

<<<

 and environmental liabilities of the plants. The sale is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2015.
In December 2014, in accordance with unbundling regulations, the Group completed the sale of transmission infrastructure between

<<<

 the UK mainland and the Thanet wind farm (300 MW) off the east coast of England to the electricity grid company Balfour Beatty. The sales sum was SEK 2 billion.
On 15 January 2015, the Group announced a new organisation and new executive management

<<<

 team, to be implemented with effect from 1 April 2015.
In January 2015, the Group announced that it has decided to put the analysis work regarding replacement reactors on hold due to the insight that the need for replacement power will occur

<<<

 later in time.
Financial overview and analysis for the Group A change is planned to be carried out in the Group's organisation with effect from 1 April 2015. The current regional structure will be replaced by six cross-border Business Areas

<<<

: Heat, Wind, Customers & Solutions, Generation, Markets and Distribution. The lignite operations will be governed in a separate unit, Mining & Generation. Distribution is a legally unbundled operation and is separated from the Group's other

<<<

 operations. There will be four reporting segments: Heat, Customers & Solutions, Power Generation and Distribution where the Power Generation segment consists of Business Areas Wind, Generation, and Markets, and the Mining & Generation unit

<<<

. In addition, the Staff Functions including treasury activities, and Shared Service Centres will be reported under the heading "Other", as was done since 2014. All operating segments are followed up according to underlying operating profit

<<<

 (i.e. operating profit ("EBIT")), excluding items affecting comparability. All segments apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). For services between segments, cost price generally applies, although in certain cases market

<<<

 prices are applied.
Net sales and financial performance for the year 2014 During 2014, net sales decreased by SEK 6.3 billion to SEK 165.9 billion (compared to SEK 172.3 billion in 2013). The decrease in net sales is mainly attributable to

<<<

 the divested electricity distribution operation in Hamburg (SEK 5.3 billion), average lower electricity prices and lower volumes. Currency effects on net sales were positive by approximately SEK 5.6 billion, due to a weaker Swedish krona compared

<<<

 with 2013. EBIT increased to SEK -2.2 billion (compared to SEK -6.2 billion in 2013). The underlying operating profit for 2014 decreased to SEK 24.1 billion (compared to SEK 28.1 billion in 2013). The decrease in the underlying operating profit

<<<

 for 2014 is mainly explained by lower production margins (SEK -2.1 billion), lower generation volumes (SEK -3.0 billion), lost earnings contributions from divested operations - mainly from electricity distribution in Hamburg (SEK -0.6 billion

<<<

) and other items, net (SEK -0.7 billion) consisting of lower depreciation (SEK 0.2 billion) and currency effects of the weaker Swedish krona compared with 2013 (SEK 0.4 billion), this is partly offset by lower operating expenses (SEK 2.4 billion

<<<

). Items affecting comparability between the 2013 and 2014 operating profit amounted to SEK -26.3 billion (compared to SEK -
101

34.4 billion in 2013). Items affecting comparability consists of amongst others impairment losses (SEK -23.8 billion

<<<

), restructuring costs (SEK -0.8 billion), capital gains (SEK 3.2 billion) which pertain primarily to the sale of the Group's electricity distribution operation in Hamburg, and other items affecting comparability (SEK -5.7 billion) which pertain

<<<

 to higher provisions primarily for future expenses for the decommissioning of nuclear power in Germany. Items affecting comparability for 2013 amounted to SEK -34.4 billion. Income tax expense for 2014 amounted to SEK -0.04 billion (compared

<<<

 to SEK 1.7 billion in 2013).
Investment activities for the year ended 31 December 2014 The total amount of investments for 2014 amounted to SEK 29 billion (compared to SEK 27.8 billion in 2013) of which growth investments accounted for SEK

<<<

 12.1 billion (compared to SEK 13.5 billion in 2013) and maintenance investments for SEK 16.9 billion (compared to SEK 14.3 billion in 2013). Divestments during 2014 amounted to SEK 12.1 billion (compared to SEK 0.7 billion in 2013), of which

<<<

 SEK 8.9 billion (compared to SEK 0.3 billion in 2013) is attributable to sales of shareholdings.
Cash flow analysis for the year 2014 Funds from operations amounted to SEK 32.1 billion in 2014 (compared to SEK 31.9 billion in 2013). Cash flow

<<<

 from operating activities amounted to SEK 40.1 billion in 2014 (compared to SEK 37.8 billion in 2013).
Liabilities As of 31 December 2014, the Group's total interest-bearing liabilities were SEK 125.9 billion, which includes the remaining consideration

<<<

 for the shares in Nuon Energy amounting to SEK 19.3 billion. The remaining consideration is to be paid in 2015. Interest-bearing liabilities also included SEK 9.4 billion (compared to SEK 8.8 billion in 2013) in hybrid capital, which was issued

<<<

 in June 2005. Further interest-bearing liabilities included SEK 2.6 billion (compared to SEK 1.7 billion in 2013) in loans from the Group's minority-owned companies, and SEK 12.4 billion (compared to SEK 12.4 billion in 2013) in loans from

<<<

, among others, minority owners in the Group's Swedish nuclear power plants. The Group's reported net debt decreased by SEK 19.5 billion to SEK 79.5 billion in 2014 (compared to SEK 99 billion in 2013). Interest rate risk in the Group's debt

<<<

 portfolio is measured in terms of duration, which is permitted to vary from a norm of three years by up to 12 months either way. The duration of the Group's debt portfolio at year-end 2014 was 2.8 years including hybrid capital (compared to

<<<

 2.9 years in 2013). To adjust the duration of borrowing, the Group uses, among other instruments, interest rate swaps, interest rate forwards and options.
Accounting Policies The consolidated accounts for 2014 have been prepared, as for the

<<<

 2013 year-end accounts, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Commission for application within the EU, and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The 2014 Year-end Report for the Group

<<<

 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting, and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The accounting policies and calculation methods applied in the 2014 Year-end Report are the same as those described in the Group

<<<

's 2013 Annual Report (Note 3 to the consolidated accounts), except for the amended IFRSs endorsed by the EU and described in the Group's 2014 Year-end Report on page 30 which are effective as of the 2014 financial year. The Group's 2014 Year

<<<

-end Report is consistent with the accounting policies and calculation methods which will be used in the Group's 2014 Annual Report, to be published in March 2015.
Risk Management
The Board has the overall responsibility for risk management

<<<

 within the Group and decides on the risk appetite and risk tolerance, including the risk mandates for Energy & Commodities, Treasury and Credit. As the party with ultimate responsibility for risk management within the Group, the Board is responsible

<<<

 for
102

obtaining knowledge of the risks inherent in the operations of the Group. The main purpose of risk management in the Group is to identify, manage and control risks to which the Group is exposed, as well as ensuring that the risk exposure

<<<

 is aligned with strategic and financial targets. This provides transparency to the decision makers and the owner. Risk management is emphasised through the Three Lines of Defence model, which establishes the three different roles - risk ownership

<<<

, control and assurance. Line management, as the risk owner, provides the first line of defence, the second line of defence is provided by the Risk Management organisation and the third line of defence is provided by the (internal) auditor.

<<<

 The VRC is chaired by the CEO and serves both as a decision-making body (decisions are made by the CEO) and a preparatory body for the Board.
The Group's Chief Risk Officer ("CRO") is responsible for organising risk management within the Group

<<<

. The CRO is responsible for this organisation at the Group level and is also accountable for the risk management framework within the Group. The CRO reports to the CFO, as well as providing information on risk issues to the Board or, if the

<<<

 Board so decides, to a Board Committee. The CRO is entitled to access any information regarding risk within any entity of the Group. The CRO's responsibilities are to:
 secure risk governance in the Group;
 co-ordinate and ensure risk control

<<<

 and transparency of the Group's risk positions; and
 support the decision-making of the business and top management.
The CRO's responsibilities as the second line of defence include monitoring that the organisation is implementing these practices

<<<

 at all appropriate levels.
The Enterprise Risk Management process in the Group The Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process is one common continuous risk management process where risks are identified, assessed, managed, followed-up and controlled

<<<

. This corporate governance process is applicable to all risks in the Group, including project risk management, and serves as the Group's overarching risk process that is to be embedded into all operations. The process is designed to identify

<<<

 and manage potential events and developments that may affect the achievement of objectives, all according to the risk appetite of the Group. The ERM process aims to create transparency, risk awareness and to support management in decision-making

<<<

, strategy setting, business planning and business operations. The ERM process is an iterative process that is conducted in conjunction with the Group's business planning and reporting cycles. The output of the process is identified, managed

<<<

 and controlled risk.

 investment in the Capital Securities, or (b) an entity not organised under the laws of Sweden.
Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non-resident holder of any Capital

<<<

 Securities should not be subject to Swedish income tax provided that such holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Capital Securities are effectively connected. Under Swedish tax law, no withholding tax is imposed

<<<

 on payments of principal or interest to a non-resident holder of any Capital Securities.
Resident holders of Capital Securities As used herein, a resident holder means a holder of Capital Securities who is (a) an individual who is a resident

<<<

 in Sweden for tax purposes or (b) an entity organised under the laws of Sweden.
Generally, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) that are resident holders of any Capital Securities, all capital

<<<

 income (e.g. income that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on Capital Securities) will be taxable.
Specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder of Capital Securities

<<<

 realises a capital loss on the Capital Securities and to any currency exchange gains or losses.
If the Capital Securities are held by a Swedish resident nominee, including a Swedish branch, in accordance with the Swedish Financial Instruments

<<<

 Accounts Act (SFS 1998:1479), Swedish preliminary taxes are withheld by the nominee on payments of amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a private individual (or an estate of a decease individual) that is a

<<<

 resident holder of any Capital Securities.

United Kingdom Taxation
Withholding Taxation The comments below are of a general nature and are not intended to be exhaustive. They assume that there will be no substitution of the Capital Securities

<<<

 or the Issuer, or variation of the terms of the Capital Securities, and do not address the consequences of any such substitution or variation (notwithstanding that such substitution may be permitted by the terms and conditions of the Capital

<<<

 Securities). Any prospective holders of Capital Securities who are in doubt as to their own tax position should consult their professional advisers.
The comments in this part are based on current United Kingdom tax law as applied in England

<<<

 and Wales and HM Revenue & Customs practice (which may not be binding on HM Revenue & Customs). Unless stated otherwise they assume that interest on the Capital Securities does not have a United Kingdom source and, in particular, that the Issuer

<<<

 is not United Kingdom resident or acts through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom in relation to the Capital Securities.
References in this part to "interest" shall mean amounts that are treated as interest for the purposes of

<<<

 United Kingdom taxation.
1 Interest on the Notes
Payments of interest on the Capital Securities by the Issuer may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax.
If interest on the Capital Securities

<<<

 has a United Kingdom source then while the Capital Securities continue to be listed on a recognised stock exchange within the meaning of Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007, payments of interest by the Issuer may be made without withholding

<<<

 or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax. The London Stock Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities will be treated as listed on the London Stock Exchange if they are included in the Official

<<<

 List by the United Kingdom Listing Authority and are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
2 Information Reporting
Information relating to securities may be required to be provided to HM Revenue & Customs in certain circumstances

<<<

. This may include the value of the Capital Securities, details of the holders or beneficial owners of the Capital Securities (or the persons for whom the Capital Securities are held), details of the persons to whom payments derived from the

<<<

 Capital Securities are or may be paid and information and documents in connection with transactions relating to the Capital Securities. Information may be required to be provided by, amongst others, the holders of the Capital Securities, persons

<<<

 by (or via) whom payments derived from the Capital Securities are made or who receive (or would be entitled to receive) such payments, persons who effect or are a party to transactions relating to the Capital Securities on behalf of others

<<<

 and certain registrars or administrators. In certain circumstances, the information obtained by HM Revenue & Customs may be provided to tax authorities in other countries.
EU Savings Directive Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation

<<<

 of savings income, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in its jurisdiction to or for the benefit

<<<

 of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State.
On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope

<<<

 of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new
106

requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the directive, in particular to include additional types of

<<<

 income payable on securities. The amending directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments must be reported. This approach may apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts

<<<

) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.
For a transitional period, Austria is instead required (unless

<<<

 during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which operate a withholding

<<<

 system when they are implemented.
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including

<<<

 Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Certain provisions commonly known as "FATCA" impose a withholding tax of 30 per cent. on (i) certain U.S. source

<<<

 payments and (ii) payments of gross proceeds from the disposition of assets that produce U.S. source interest or dividends made to persons that fail to meet certain certification or reporting requirements. In order to avoid becoming subject

<<<

 to this withholding tax, non-U.S. financial institutions must enter into agreements with the IRS ("IRS Agreements") (as described below) or otherwise be exempt from the requirements of FATCA. Non-U.S. financial institutions that enter into

<<<

 IRS Agreements or become subject to provisions of local law ("IGA legislation") intended to implement an intergovernmental agreement entered into pursuant to FATCA (an "IGA") may be required to identify and report to the government of the United

<<<

 States or another relevant jurisdiction certain information regarding "financial accounts" held by U.S. persons or entities with substantial U.S. ownership, as well as accounts of other financial institutions that are not themselves participating

<<<

 in (or otherwise exempt from) the FATCA reporting regime. In addition, in order (a) to obtain an exemption from FATCA withholding on payments it receives and/or (b) to comply with any applicable IGA legislation, a financial institution that

<<<

 enters into an IRS Agreement or is subject to IGA legislation may be required to withhold 30 per cent. from all, or a portion of, certain payments made to persons that fail to provide the financial institution information, consents and forms

<<<

 or other documentation that may be necessary for such financial institution to determine whether such person is compliant with FATCA or otherwise exempt from FATCA withholding.
Under FATCA, withholding is required with respect to payments to

<<<

 persons that are not compliant with FATCA or that do not provide the necessary information, consents or documentation made on or after (i) July 1, 2014, in respect of certain U.S. source payments, (ii) January 1, 2017, in respect of payments

<<<

 of gross proceeds (including principal repayments) from the disposition of property that can produce US source interest or dividends and (iii) January 1, 2017 (at the earliest) in respect of "foreign passthru payments".
The application of FATCA

<<<

 to interest, principal or other amounts paid with respect to the Capital Securities and the information reporting obligations of the Issuer and other entities in the payment chain is still developing. In particular, a number of jurisdictions

<<<

 (including Sweden) have entered into, or have announced their intention to enter into, IGAs (or similar mutual understandings) with the United States, which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. The full impact of such

<<<

 agreements (and the laws implementing such agreements in such jurisdictions) on reporting and withholding responsibilities under FATCA is unclear. The Issuer and other entities in the payment chain may be required to report certain information

<<<

 on their U.S. account holders to government authorities in their respective jurisdictions or the United States in order (i) to obtain an exemption from FATCA withholding on payments they receive and/or
107

(ii) to comply with applicable law

<<<

 in their jurisdiction. It is not yet certain how the United States and the jurisdictions which enter into IGAs will address withholding on "foreign passthru payments" (which may include payments on the Capital Securities) or if such withholding

<<<

 will be required at all.
Whilst the Capital Securities are in global form and held within the clearing systems, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Capital Securities by the

<<<

 Issuer, any paying agent and the common depositary for the clearing systems, given that each of the entities in the payment chain from (but excluding) the Issuer to (and including) the clearing systems is a major financial institution whose

<<<

 business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Capital Securities. The documentation expressly contemplates the possibility that the Capital Securities

<<<

 may go into definitive form and therefore that they may be taken out of the clearing systems. If this were to happen, then a non-FATCA compliant holder could be subject to FATCA withholding. However, definitive Capital Securities will only

<<<

 be printed in remote circumstances.
If an amount in respect of withholding were to be deducted or withheld from interest, principal or other payments on the Capital Securities as a result of FATCA, none of the Issuer, any paying agent or any

<<<

 other person would, pursuant to the Conditions be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the deduction or withholding. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected.
FATCA is particularly complex and

<<<

 its application to the Issuer, the Capital Securities and investors is subject to change. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA and to learn how FATCA might affect each investor

<<<

 in its particular circumstance.
The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT") On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece

<<<

, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States").
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in Capital Securities (including secondary

<<<

 market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings

<<<

 in Capital Securities where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State

<<<

 in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
Joint

<<<

 statements issued by participating Member States indicate an intention to implement the FTT by 1 January 2016.
However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States, and the scope of any such tax is

<<<

 uncertain. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.
Prospective holders of Capital Securities are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
