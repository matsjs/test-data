 Bond Issue 2013/2016

Oslo 2 March 2016
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING Nordic Trustee ASA (previously Norsk Tillitsmann ASA) (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (together* the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond

<<<

 issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") of NGK 700,000,000 issued by Island Offshore Shipholding L.P. (the "Issuer").
Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 22 March 2013 (the "Bond

<<<

 Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. This summons (the "Summons") is being issued at the request of the Issuer. Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its entirety.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer, market

<<<

 conditions and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

BACKGROUND AND COMPANY UPDATE Introduction The precipitous decline in world

<<<

 oil prices over the past 18 months has severely curtailed the revenues of offshore oil and natural gas producers. In response to the dramatically changed oil price environment, oil and gas exploration companies have drastically reduced their

<<<

 capital expenditure budgets and therefore the work available to the Issuer and other offshore services providers. Significant vessel overcapacity in most segments has further resulted in pressure on both rates and utilization.
The downturn

<<<

 in the offshore services market has materially and adversely affected the business of the Issuer and the Group. As a result, the Issuer has for some time actively pursued measures to improve its financial position and adapt to the prevailing

<<<

 market conditions.
Measures already taken include the sale of two vessels, strengthening the Issuer's liquidity position by approximately NOK 400 million. In addition, the Issuer has postponed the delivery of the newbuild vessel 'Island Victory

<<<

', and renegotiated the terms of its shipbuilding contract with Kawasaki Heavy Industries for 'Island Navigator'.

PO Box 1470 Vika. N-0I16 Oslo, Haakon VI Is gate 1. Oslo

nordictfustee.conn

On the operational side, the Issuer has laid up

<<<

 three vessels ('Island Duke', 'Island Duchess' and 'Island Express'), and an additional four vessels have been stacked for the winter season ('Island Frontier1, 'Island Webserver', 'Island Spirit' and 'Island Constructor'), reducing its operational

<<<

 costs to a minimum. Further layups are continuously considered for vessels at the end of their existing term contracts. Moreover, the Issuer has negotiated reduced working hours for its employees by 10% and re-negotiated a number of significant

<<<

 vendor agreements.

The Issuer foresees severe financial challenges for the period from 2016 to 2019, and it has debt maturities coming up over the next months, of which it has no readily available means of refinancing. Furthermore, cash flow

<<<

 from operations is not sufficient to service its current amortisation schedule, and the Company does not expect that the market will improve materially in the short to medium term.

Given the prevailing market conditions and the Group's debt

<<<

 structure, the Issuer has approached its key creditors and requested postponement of instalments and maturities as well as temporary adjustment of certain financial covenants in its debt financing,

1.2 Conditional agreement with key secured

<<<

 creditors
The Issuer has since July 2015 been in discussions with its key secured creditors to ease the repayment schedule on some of the Group's senior secured first lien credit facilities and amend certain financial covenants. Subject to

<<<

 certain conditions, the secured creditors have agreed to the following key amendments (the "Senior Amendments"):

a)

Approximately NOK 189 million in instalments will be postponed over the next 18 months,

subject to a cash sweep mechanism

<<<

 linked to the duration of certain contracts and option

utilisation.

b)

The secured creditors will agree to temporary adjustments of the debt service coverage ratio and

gearing ratio covenants as at 31 December 2015 and in 2016 and 2017

<<<

:

(i) The minimum debt service coverage ratio will be reduced to 0.6:1,0 as at 31 December 2015 and in 2016 and to 1.1:1.0 in 2017.

(ii) The maximum gearing ratio will be increased to 8.5:1.0 as at 31 December 2015 and in 2016 and 7.5:1.0in

<<<

 2017.

c)

No dividend payments, payments on loans from the Issuer's shareholders or other distributions

to the Issuer's shareholders shall be made until six months after all the deferred instalments have

been fully repaid.

d)

No capital

<<<

 expenditures shall be made by any member of the Group, except for normal

maintenance and/or capital expenditures to operate vessels owned by the Group and in respect

of the acquisition of the newbuild vessels 'Island Victory' and 'Island

<<<

 Navigator',

The Senior Amendments are subject to, inter alia, the following conditions precedent:

9434143/2

a)

Receipt by the Issuer of new equity contribution or subordinated shareholder loans ofNOK 100

million, in addition to theNOK

<<<

 80 million subordinated shareholder loans provided to the Issuer

in December 2015.

b)

Newbuildings 'Island Defender', 'Island Discoverer' and 'Island Diligence' to be owned and

financed outside of the Group.

c)

Acceptance from the Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting to the following changes in the Bond Issue:

(i) extension o f the maturity of the Bonds by 30 months;

(ii) cash interest payable on the Bonds to be reduced to no more than the average cash interest margin paid on the Issuer's senior

<<<

 secured first lien credit facilities, equivalent to 3 month NIBOR plus 2.41%; and

(iii) alignment of financial covenants to the same levels as those agreed for the senior secured first lien credit facilities.

1.3 Negotiations with Bondholders

<<<


Since early January 2016, the Issuer and its advisers have been in discussions with the Bond Trustee and an ad-hoc group of Bondholders that in aggregate beneficially own more than 40% of the Bonds (the "Ad-hoc Committee") to seek consensus

<<<

 on the terms on which the Bond Agreement can be amended to allow for the implementation of the Senior Amendments. The Bond Trustee and the Ad-hoc Committee have been assisted by Clarksons Platou Securities AS ("CPS") and Advokatfirmaet BA-HR

<<<

 DA ("BA-HR", and together with CPS, the "Trustee Advisers").

Following extensive negotiations with the Ad-hoc Committee, the Issuer and the Ad-hoc Committee have reached agreement on a proposal that the members of the Ad-hoc Committee have

<<<

 undertaken to support.

THE PROPOSAL

c)

majority resolution at a Bondholders' Meeting for the Tranche

<<<

 A Bonds.

from and including the date of the implementation of the Proposal (the "Effective Date"):
