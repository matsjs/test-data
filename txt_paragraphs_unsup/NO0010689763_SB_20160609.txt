Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Oslo, 9 June 2016

1.

PARTIES

Nordic Trustee ASA (formerly Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee")) acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the

<<<

 above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue" or the "Bonds") in respect of which Iona Energy Company (UK) Limited (in administration) (formerly Iona Energy Company (UK) Pic (the "Issuer")) is the issuer and Iona Energy Inc. ("Iona" or the 

<<<

"Parent") and Iona UK Huntington Limited (in administration) (the "Huntington Subsidiary") are the guarantors.

All capitalised terms used in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally

<<<

 dated 26 September 2013 (as amended on 3 June 2014 and as amended and restated on 17 April 2015) and made between the Issuer, the Parent, the Huntington Subsidiary and the Bond Trustee (the "Bond Agreement") or the summons dated 14 December

<<<

 2015 (the "December Summons") to the Bondholders' Meeting held on 21 December 2015 (the "December Bondholders' Meeting") unless otherwise stated herein.

The information in this Summons regarding the Issuer is provided by the Joint Administrators

<<<

, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

2. BACKGROUND

2.1 The administration of the Companies

As explained in the December Summons, on 18 November 2015, the Parent announced that the

<<<

 proposed farm-out in respect of the Orlando Asset, which was an integral part of the proposed restructuring of the Group (the "Restructuring"), could not proceed and it was highly likely that the Issuer and the Huntington Subsidiaiy (together

<<<

, the "Companies") would need to commence insolvency proceedings to protect the interests of all stakeholders. Following the Parent's announcement, management of the Companies commenced an accelerated M&A process in order to seek to dispose

<<<

 of the businesses or assets of the Companies to one or more third party purchasers (the "M&A Process"). The Companies' management also engaged in discussions in order to exit the Issuer's investment in the Trent & Tyne Asset. It was anticipated

<<<

 that any disposals of the Companies' assets and/or the exit from the Trent & Tyne Asset would be carried out by the Companies in administration.

On 22 December 2015, the Bond Trustee issued a notice to the Group in accordance with clause 

<<<

16.4 of the Bond Agreement pursuant to which it declared that due to the Issuer's failure (i) to make a payment on 1 December 2015 under the Decommissioning Security Agreement in respect of the Huntington Asset, and (ii) to implement the Restructuring

<<<

 by 30 November 2015, the Outstanding

301667173 vl8
PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo. Haakon-Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

Bonds were in default and the Outstanding Bonds together with accrued interest, costs and expenses were due for

<<<

 immediate repayment. On the same date, the Bond Trustee also enforced its security over the Escrow Account. On 30 December 2015, the Bond Trustee applied US $50 million from the Escrow Account in partial prepayment of the principal of the Outstanding

<<<

 Bonds. The Bond Trustee currently holds an amount equal to US $7,005,330 as at the date of this Summons (the "Escrow Retention Amount") in accordance with the authority granted to it at the December Bondholders' Meeting.
On 23 December 201

<<<

5, the directors of each of the Issuer and the Huntington Subsidiaiy filed notices of intention to appoint Chad Griffin and Lisa Rickelton of FTI Consulting LLP ("FTI") to act as joint administrators of each of the Companies (the "Joint Administrators

<<<

"). The Joint Administrators were appointed to each of the Companies on 6 January 2016.
For further details on the steps that the Joint Administrators have taken since their appointment, and the transactions in respect of the Companies' assets

<<<

 that have been, or are in the course of being, implemented to date, Bondholders are referred to the letter from the Joint Administrators to all known creditors dated 14 January 2016 and the "Joint Administrators' Report and Statement of Proposals

<<<

" dated 10 February 2016 (the "Statement of Proposals"), both of which are available on www.stamdata.com.
2.2 Offer for the shares in the Issuer by Bridge Petroleum Limited
On 29 January 2016, the Joint Administrators received an indicative

<<<

 offer from Bridge Petroleum Limited ("Bridge") for the entire issued share capital in the Issuer (the "Issuer Shares") in exchange for an element of upfront cash consideration and deferred consideration which is, in part, calculated by reference

<<<

 to future oil production from the Orlando Asset and Kells Asset (the "Offer").
Bridge is an independent oil and gas company which was established in 2015 to invest in opportunities in the UK Continental Shelf. Bridge will partner with a consortium

<<<

 of leading industry suppliers to develop the Orlando Asset and the Kells Asset to first oil. The Joint Administrators understand that Bridge intends to commence redevelopment of the Orlando Asset in Q3 2016 and is targeting first oil in late

<<<

 2017.
On 8 March 2016, the Joint Administrators and the Issuer entered into heads of terms with Bridge in relation to the Offer. The heads of terms initially granted an exclusivity period until 18 April 2016 to enable Bridge to negotiate the

<<<

 details of the Offer and conduct its due diligence. This deadline has been extended until 3 June 2016. Bridge has paid a non-refundable deposit of US $250,000 to the Issuer in connection with the signing of the heads of terms (the "Deposit

<<<

"). The Deposit will be used to fund part of the CVA Fund (as defined below).
The Offer follows several months of marketing of the Issuer Shares and the Issuer's assets by management and the Joint Administrators. It is the view of the Joint

<<<

 Administrators that the Offer represents the best offer available in the circumstances to maximise recoveries to Bondholders and other stakeholders. Accordingly, the Issuer is seeking the consent of the Bondholders to the Proposals (as defined

<<<

 below) in this Summons in order to implement a transaction to deliver the sale of the Issuer Shares to Bridge on the terms of the Offer and in accordance with the steps set out in paragraph 2.4 below (the "Transaction").
The Bond Trustee has

<<<

 engaged Advokatfirmaet Thommessen AS ("Thommessen") to advise it in connection with the Norwegian law aspects of the Transaction.
2.3 Summary of the Offer
(a) The key economic terms o f the Offer
-2-

The key economic terms o f the Offer are

<<<

 as follows:
· following a company voluntary arrangement of the Issuer to compromise its existing liabilities taking effect (see paragraph 2.4 below), Bridge Petroleum 2 Limited ("BP2"), an acquisition vehicle 90 per cent, owned by Bridge, will

<<<

 acquire the Issuer Shares. The Huntington Subsidiary will not be acquired by BP2;
· BP2 will lend US $1.75 million (the "CVA Funding Amount") to the Issuer which, together with the Deposit, will constitute a loan of US $2 million that will

<<<

 be used to establish a fund for the benefit of certain of the unsecured creditors of the Issuer in order to pay them a dividend in the company voluntary arrangement;
· BP2 will lend US $5.7 million (the "Partial Repayment Amount") to the Issuer

<<<

. The Issuer will pay the Partial Repayment Amount to the Bond Trustee to be applied as a partial repayment of the aggregate amount outstanding under the Outstanding Bonds;
· the Outstanding Bonds will be transferred to Lazarus Limited, a special

<<<

 purpose vehicle incorporated in the Cayman Islands ("Newco"), in consideration for the issuance by Newco of new zero coupon limited recourse bonds of an aggregate principal amount of up to US $250 million (the "New Bonds" and the holders thereof

<<<

, the "New Bondholders") (such exchange of Outstanding Bonds for New Bonds, the "Bond Exchange");
· BP2 will enter into a debt sale agreement (the "Debt Sale Agreement") with Newco, pursuant to which it will pay to Newco the following amounts

<<<

 (the "Debt Sale Consideration") in consideration for Newco transferring the Outstanding Bonds to BP2:
(i) US $1;
(ii) an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount recovered by the Issuer in respect of (i) VAT for periods up to and including

<<<

 completion of the Transaction, (ii) insurance rebates, and (iii) the sale of the Kells tree owned by the Issuer (together the "Early Deferred Consideration");
(iii) an amount in cash equivalent to 5 per cent, of the Issuer's gross revenue from

<<<

 the sale of crude oil from the Orlando Asset and the Kells Asset from the date that (i) the Issuer first delivers crude oil from either of the Orlando or the Kells fields to the Bridge Lender (as defined below), or (ii) such other date that

<<<

 crude oil produced from either the Orlando Asset or the Kells Asset is first sold commercially (such date being "First Oil") (the "Deferred Consideration");
(iv) BP2 at its option may elect to terminate the DSA by making an acceleration payment

<<<

 to Newco in respect of the total projected Deferred Consideration payable to Newco, being an amount calculated in accordance with the formula contained in the Debt Sale Agreement (the "Acceleration Payment"); and
(v) if BP2 breaches the restrictions

<<<

 in the Debt Sale Agreement in relation to (i) disposals of BP2's interest in the Orlando Asset or the Kells Asset, and/or (ii) disposals by BP2 of the shares in the Issuer, Newco will be entitled to demand from BP2 a liquidated settlement payment

<<<

, being an amount calculated in accordance with the formula contained in the Debt Sale Agreement (the "Liquidated Settlement Payment"), the payment o f which by BP2 to Newco will result in the termination of the DSA;

· the maximum aggregate

<<<

 amount of Deferred Consideration payable to Newco under the Debt Sale Agreement shall be capped at US $250 million;
· Newco's right to receive payment of the Deferred Consideration or the Acceleration Payment (if any) will be subordinated to

<<<

 certain other liabilities owed by BP2, as further described at sub-paragraph (b) below;
· BP2 will refinance an amount of Outstanding Bonds at that time equal to approximately US $23.8 million into an intercompany balance between BP2 and the

<<<

 Issuer. An amount of Outstanding Bonds equal to approximately $286.5 million (including the Outstanding Bonds refinanced as an intercompany loan) will be cancelled by BP2; and
· under the terms of the New Bonds, Newco will make mandatory repayments

<<<

 of principal to the New Bondholders from the net proceeds of the Early Deferred Consideration and the Deferred Consideration, (or, in the alternative, from the Acceleration Payment (if any) or the Liquidated Settlement Payment (if any)) under

<<<

 the Debt Sale Agreement if and when it receives these proceeds from BP2 under the Debt Sale Agreement.
(b) Newco's right to receive Early Deferred Consideration, Deferred Consideration and/or the Acceleration Payment (ifany)
In connection with

<<<

 its acquisition of the Issuer, BP2 will obtain US $15 million financing for the Transaction from a commercial counterparty (the "Bridge Lender"), in respect of which BP2 will pay interest. The Issuer is required by the Bridge Lender to enter

<<<

 into certain hedging agreements with an affiliate of the Bridge Lender (the "Hedge Counterparty") in respect of oil prices for a volume of oil equivalent to up to 75 per cent, of the IP production profile of the Issuer's share of the Orlando

<<<

 Asset until the date that the acquisition financing is repaid in full. A deferred hedging premium, which will be calculated after Completion, will be payable by BP2 to the Hedge Counterparty (such hedging premium, together with the US $15 million

<<<

 financing (and interest thereon), being the "Bridge Acquisition Financing").
Under the terms of the Debt Sale Agreement, the Deferred Consideration will be due to Newco from the date of First Oil. However, Newco will not be entitled to receive

<<<

 payment of the Deferred Consideration (or the Acceleration Payment (if any)) until the date that both (i) the US $15 million and interest thereon have been repaid in full, and (ii) the earlier of (A) the day the hedging premiums have been fully

<<<

 paid to the Hedge Counterparty and (B) 31 December 2018. Therefore, Newco's right to payment is subordinated to the Bridge Lender's and the Hedge Counterparty's rights of payment in respect of the Bridge Acquisition Financing.
Provided that

<<<

 the Bridge Acquisition Financing has not been accelerated, Newco will be entitled to receive Early Deferred Consideration from BP2 within ten business days of receipt by BP2 of any amounts which constitute Early Deferred Consideration.
On and

<<<

 from completion of the Transaction, the Bridge Lender and the Hedge Counterparty will have first ranking security over the assets of and shares in the Issuer and BP2 to secure amounts payable to them under the Bridge Acquisition Financing.

<<<

 Newco will not have any security over the assets of or shares in the Issuer or BP2. However, Newco will benefit from a guarantee granted by the Issuer of BP2's obligations under the Debt Sale Agreement (as described at paragraph 2.4 below)

<<<

.
(c) Other key terms o f the Debt Sale Agreement
In addition to the provisions outlined above, the key terms of the Debt Sale Agreement are as follows: · BP2 will provide to Newco:
-4-

o on a quarterly basis during the development phase,

<<<

 infoimation on the development of the Orlando field and the Kells field;
o on a semi-annual basis, 12-month forecasts of the Deferred Consideration payable in the following 12-month period;
o details of any material amendment, termination,

<<<

 surrender, revocation or relinquishment of the Licences in respect of the Orlando Asset or the Kells Asset; and
o any other information reasonably requested by Newco to enable Newco to ensure BP2 has complied with all of its obligations under

<<<

 the Debt Sale Agreement;
· BP2 and its affiliates may not grant any security over the shares in the Issuer, the Orlando Asset, the Kells Asset or the assets in respect of which Early Deferred Consideration is payable without Newco's consent

<<<

, unless the security (i) is permitted by the terms of the Bridge Lender's financing documents, or (ii) is not granted over more than 50 per cent, of Kells Asset and 50 per cent, of the Orlando Asset;
· BP2 may not dispose of its interest in

<<<

 the Orlando Asset and/or the Kells Asset below 50 per cent, unless BP2's obligations to pay Deferred Consideration to Newco are novated to the proposed transferee or its affiliate (and subject to certain restrictions on the transferee or affiliate

<<<

 having holdings in, or income derived from, oil and gas assets), and subject to Newco being satisfied it has received an adequate indemnity in respect of any loss that Newco may suffer if there are adverse withholding tax consequences resulting

<<<

 from such disposal; and
· BP2 may not dispose of its shares in the Issuer unless (i) such disposal is for BP2's entire shareholding, (ii) the Debt Sale Agreement is novated to the transferee of the shares or its affiliate on the same terms

<<<

 (and subject to certain restrictions on the transferee or affiliate having holdings in, or income derived from, oil and gas assets), (iii) the UK Oil and Gas Authority has issued a comfort letter in respect of the transfer, and (iv) Newco is

<<<

 satisfied it has received an adequate indemnity in respect of any loss that Newco may suffer if there are adverse withholding tax consequences resulting from such disposal.
2.4 Overview of the Transaction steps
The Transaction will be implemented

<<<

 in a series of steps as described below. At the date of this Summons, Steps 1 to 4 inclusive have already occurred. The exact order and timing of the steps may be subject to change.
Step 1 - Enforcement o f share pledge over the Issuer Shares

<<<

; re-registration o f the Issuer as a private limited company
Pursuant to the authority granted to it at the December Bondholders' Meeting, on 27 May 2016 the Bond Trustee (in its capacity as Security Agent) issued a notice to the Obligors enforcing

<<<

 its share pledge over the Issuer Shares and notifying the Obligors that it will exercise all voting rights in respect o f the Issuer Shares in such a manner as it, in its discretion, thinks appropriate.
In order to implement the Transaction

<<<

, it was necessary for the Issuer to be re-registered as a private limited company. In order to effect the re-registration, the directors and the Joint Administrators convened, at short notice, a shareholder's meeting of the Issuer at which

<<<

 the Bond Trustee (in its capacity as Security Agent and sole shareholder of the Issuer) resolved that: (a) the Issuer would be re registered as a private limited company; and (b) the name of the Issuer would be changed to "Iona Energy Company

<<<

 (UK) Limited" (the "Issuer Re-Registration").
-5-

Step 2 - Transfer o f the shares in the Huntington Subsidiary
As the Offer excludes the Issuer's shareholding in the Huntington Subsidiary, it was necessary for the entire issued share capital

<<<

 in the Huntington Subsidiary (the "Huntington Shares") to be transferred from the Issuer to Iona UK Developments Co Limited ("Iona Developments"). Iona Developments is a sister company of the Issuer and is not in insolvency. In order to transfer

<<<

 the Huntington Shares to Iona Developments, it was necessary for the Bond Trustee to release the security it held over the Huntington Shares and consent to the transfer of the Huntington Shares to Iona Developments for consideration of US 

<<<

$1.
The Bond Trustee has exercised its discretion to consent to the transfer of the Huntington Shares and the release of its security over them pursuant to the authority granted to it at the December Bondholders' Meeting. Accordingly, Iona Developments

<<<

 is now the 100 per cent, shareholder of the Huntington Subsidiary. The security granted over the assets of the Huntington Subsidiary has not been released and it is not expected that the Huntington Shares will have any equity value. The Huntington

<<<

 Subsidiary will remain liable as a Guarantor in respect of the Outstanding Bonds (see Step 6A below) notwithstanding the ultimate cancellation of the Outstanding Bonds themselves as part of the Transaction.
Step 3 - Transfer o fRecovery Actions

<<<

 to Huntington
Based on their preliminary investigations into the affairs of the Issuer, the Joint Administrators have identified one or more possible rights to certain recovery actions (the "Recovery Actions") which the Issuer may have. In

<<<

 order to preserve these Recovery Actions so that they may be investigated properly and pursued (if appropriate) in due course, the Joint Administrators have assigned the rights to the Recovery Actions to the Huntington Subsidiaiy. As the Huntington

<<<

 Subsidiary will not be released from its obligations as Guarantor, to the extent that any Recovery Actions are brought by the Joint Administrators of the Huntington Subsidiary which result in cash realisations, the Huntington Subsidiary is

<<<

 required to retain those cash realisations and, when it is concluded that no further realisations can be made, pay the proceeds to the Bond Trustee (acting in its capacity as the New Bond Trustee (as defined below)) in a single lump sum payment

<<<

 for distribution as contemplated in paragraph 2.7 below.
Step 4 - Execution o f the Bridge SPA; launch o f the CVA
Pursuant to the authority granted to it at the December Bondholders' Meeting, the Bond Trustee has entered into a sale and purchase

<<<

 agreement with BP2 (the "Bridge SPA"). Pursuant to the Bridge SPA, BP2 has agreed to acquire the Issuer Shares in exchange for consideration of US $1. Completion under the Bridge SPA is subject to the following conditions precedent:
(a) written

<<<

 confirmation from the Secretary of State that it does not intend to revoke either of the Licences in respect of the Orlando Asset or the Kells Asset or require a change of control in the Issuer under the terms of any Licences;
(b) written approval

<<<

 from the Secretary of State in respect of the Debt Sale Agreement and the Iona Guarantee (as defined below) or confirmation that the Debt Sale Agreement and the Iona Guarantee do not require the approval of the Secretaiy of State;
(c) the CVA

<<<

 (as defined below) being approved at the requisite meetings and the expiry o f the 28day challenge period in respect thereof; and
(d) approval of the proposals outlined in this Summons at the Bondholders' Meeting.
-6-

On 2 June 2016, the

<<<

 Joint Administrators launched a company voluntary arrangement in respect of the Issuer under Part I of the UK Insolvency Act 1986 (the "CVA"). A company voluntary arrangement is a statutory procedure whereby the Issuer can propose an arrangement

<<<

 or compromise with its unsecured creditors, which, if approved by the requisite majority of voting creditors, will bind all unsecured creditors of the Issuer, irrespective of whether they voted in favour of it or not.
The purpose of the CVA

<<<

 is to effect a full and final settlement of all of the claims of the unsecured creditors of the Issuer (the "Unsecured Creditors") in order that BP2 is able to acquire the Issuer Shares free of any liabilities to the Unsecured Creditors. The

<<<

 CVA will give the Unsecured Creditors a better recoveiy than they would otherwise have if the Transaction did not occur and the Issuer was dissolved.
In exchange for the release of their claims against the Issuer through the CVA, certain Unsecured

<<<

 Creditors will be entitled to a distribution from a US $2 million fund, which will be made available to the Issuer by way of a loan from BP2 on Completion (as defined below) (the "CVA Fund"). It is expected that the Unsecured Creditors who

<<<

 are entitled to a dividend will receive between 4 to 6 pence in the pound in proportion to their claims against the Issuer.
None of the Parent, the Huntington Subsidiaiy (both of which are also Unsecured Creditors of the Issuer by virtue of

<<<

 outstanding intercompany loans), the Bond Trustee, the Bondholders or Britannic Trading Limited ("BTL") will be entitled to receive a dividend from the CVA Fund. The claims of the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders, and BTL will not be compromised

<<<

 and released as part of the CVA but will instead be released separately in accordance with the transaction steps set out below.
A copy of the proposal for the CVA will be available on www.stamdata.com.
The Joint Administrators will deliver

<<<

 written undertakings between the Issuer and the Huntington Subsidiaiy in relation to expenses of the administration of the Issuer, and the Supervisors' ability to make modifications to the CVA.
Step 5 --West Wick Assignment
As noted in the

<<<

 Joint Administrators' Statement of Proposals, the Joint Administrators have entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Chevron North Sea Limited ("Chevron") in respect of the Issuer's 58.73% working interest in the West Wick licence (Licence

<<<

 P.185) ("West Wick" and the sale of West Wick to Chevron, the "West Wick Transaction"). Under the terms of the West Wick Transaction, the consideration payable by Chevron to the Issuer will be deferred and contingent upon, among other things

<<<

, approval of a field development plan for West Wick, which may not be granted until after the Transaction completes.
Accordingly, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee will enter into an assignment agreement (the "West Wick Assignment") pursuant

<<<

 to which on and from, and subject to, completion of the Transaction, any consideration payable to the Issuer by Chevron in connection with the West Wick Transaction (the "West Wick Consideration") must be paid to the Bond Trustee (acting in

<<<

 its capacity as the New Bond Trustee, as defined below). The Bond Trustee will then distribute the proceeds as contemplated in paragraph 2.7 below.
Step 6 - CVA meetings held
To take effect, the CVA must be approved by a majority of Unsecured

<<<

 Creditors representing at least 75% in value of the claims held by all of the Unsecured Creditors voting at a meeting of the Unsecured Creditors (the "Creditors' Meeting"). The Bond Trustee, in its capacity as shareholder of the Issuer, will

<<<

 also vote in favour of the CVA at a member's meeting (the "Member's Meeting").
-7-

The aggregate amount outstanding under the Outstanding Bonds as at the date of this Summons is approximately US $292.2 million, excluding accrued but unpaid

<<<

 interest and default interest (the "Bond Debt"). Based on information made available to the Bond Trustee by the Joint Administrators, it is estimated that the aggregate value of the assets of the Obligors which are subject to Security and which

<<<

 the Bond Trustee would recover if the Transaction did not occur and the Issuer were dissolved is approximately US $11.4 million (including the Escrow Retention Amount). As a consequence, it is estimated that an amount equal to approximately

<<<

 US $280.9 million of the Bond Debt represents an unsecured claim of the Bondholders against the Issuer (the "Under-secured Bond Debt").
Pursuant to the authority granted to it at the December Bondholders' Meeting, the Bond Trustee will vote

<<<

 in favour of the CYA (a) for and on behalf of Bondholders as Unsecured Creditors in respect of the Under-secured Bond Debt at the Creditors' Meeting, and (b) in its capacity as sole shareholder of the Issuer at the Member's Meeting.
Step 6A

<<<

 - Amendments to the Bond Agreement approved and take effect; call on and confirmation o f the Huntington Guarantee
It is proposed that Bondholders will approve certain amendments to the Bond Agreement, which are required to be made before the

<<<

 Transaction can complete. For details of the proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement, see paragraph 2.5 below.
If the proposed amendments to the Bond Agreement are approved at the Bondholders' Meeting and take effect, the Bond Trustee will

<<<

 make a demand under the guarantee in clause 13 of the Bond Agreement. As a consequence of the amendments to the Bond Agreement outlined in paragraph 2.5 below, the Huntington Subsidiary will not be liable for any amounts relating to interest

<<<

 of any kind in respect of the Outstanding Bonds.
In response to the Bond Trustee's demand under the guarantee, the Huntington Subsidiaiy will provide a letter (the "Huntington Confirmation") to the Bond Trustee and BP2 in which it will confirm

<<<

 that:
(a) it will continue to remain liable under the Guarantee as principal debtor in respect of all amounts owed to the Bond Trustee under the Bond Agreement other than amounts relating to interest of any kind;
(b) it will retain any proceeds

<<<

 that it recovers from Recovery Actions or otherwise and pay such proceeds in a single lump sum payment to the Bond Trustee (acting in its capacity as the New Bond Trustee, as defined below) (who will distribute the proceeds as contemplated

<<<

 in paragraph 2.7 below); and
(c) it will have no rights of repayment, indemnity or subrogation whatsoever against the Issuer.
Step 6B - The CVA takes effect
The Creditors' Meeting and the Member's Meeting are expected to take place on or around

<<<

 17 June 2016. A report of the chairman at the meetings must be filed at court in Scotland, after which a 28-day challenge period will commence during which time creditors of the Issuer who were entitled to vote at the Creditors' Meeting may

<<<

 challenge the CVA on the limited grounds prescribed by the Insolvency Act 1986 (the "Challenge Period"). Following the expiiy of the Challenge Period, the CVA will take effect.
If the CVA is approved at the Creditors' Meeting and the Member

<<<

's Meeting, it will be supervised by the Joint Administrators in their capacity as supervisors of the CVA (the "Supervisors"). It is proposed that the Supervisors' fees will constitute a Transaction Cost and be paid in the manner described at

<<<

 paragraph 2.8 below.
-8-

Step 6C - Preparatory stepsfo r the Bond Exchange
In order to effect the Bond Exchange on completion of the Transaction described at Step 7 below ("Completion"), it is necessary for the steps outlined in paragraphs

<<<

 (a) to (d) below to occur. It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meeting will authorise these steps to be taken, and authorise the Bond Trustee to take any action required in order to effect these steps in preparation for the Bond Exchange:

<<<


(a) five Business Days prior to Completion, trading in the Outstanding Bonds will be suspended. Bondholders will be notified of the suspension on trading via a notice on Stamdata;
(b) five Business Days prior to Completion, the Bond Trustee

<<<

 will instruct the Paying Agent to collect the Outstanding Bonds from all Bondholders in the VPS and hold them in an account in the name of the Paying Agent pending Completion;
(c) two Business Days prior to Completion, the VPS will take a record

<<<

 of the Bondholders in the VPS as at the close of business in Oslo (the "Record Date"); and
(d) one Business Day prior to Completion, the VPS will provide the Paying Agent with a written record of the Bondholders as at the Record Date.
In the

<<<

 event that Completion does not occur, Bondholders' Outstanding Bonds will be returned to their VPS accounts by the Paying Agent as soon as is practicable.
Step 7 - Completion
Completion will occur in accordance with Steps 7A to 11 below, which

<<<

 are conditional upon each other and which are expected to occur on the same day to the extent possible and sequentially (unless otheiwise stated).
Prior to the occurrence of Step 7A, the Bridge Lender and BP2, among others, will enter into

<<<

 the documents in respect of the Bridge Acquisition Financing that are necessaiy in order to enable the deposit of an amount equal to at least the aggregate of the CVA Funding Amount and the Partial Repayment Amount into a client account held

<<<

 by CMS Cameron McKenna LLP ("CMS") as advisers to the Joint Administrators (the "CMS Client Account").
Step 7A - Execution o f the Implementation Deed
The Bond Trustee, Bridge, BP2, Newco, the Bridge Lender, BTL, the Companies and the Joint

<<<

 Administrators will enter into a restructuring implementation deed which shall govern the entry into and the effectiveness of the documentation in relation to, and the taking of certain steps required to effect, the Transaction (the "Implementation

<<<

 Deed").
Step 7B --CVA Funding
Following Step 7A, the Issuer, the Joint Administrators and BP2 will execute an instruction letter to CMS, which will provide for how amounts in the CMS Client Account shall be paid in connection with Completion

<<<

.
BP2 will lend an amount equal to US $1.75 million to the Issuer, which, when aggregated with the Deposit already held by the Joint Administrators, will constitute the CVA Funding Amount held in the CMS Client Account. The Issuer will authorise

<<<

 the release of US $1.75 million from the CMS Client Account to an account in the name of the Supervisors immediately following the occurrence o f Step 10 below.
-9-

Step 7C --Completion under the SPA
Concurrent with Step 7B above, in accordance

<<<

 with its existing authority granted at the December Bondholders' Meeting, the Bond Trustee will release the security over the Issuer Shares, and the Issuer Shares will be sold by the Bond Trustee to BP2 in accordance with the terms of the Bridge

<<<

 SPA. BTL will also release its security and all outstanding claims it has against the Issuer.
New directors nominated by BP2 will be appointed to the board of the Issuer. The Joint Administrators will execute a delegation of authority to the

<<<

 new directors of the Issuer, which will enable the new directors to exercise management powers in respect of the Issuer until the Issuer ceases to be in administration (see Step 9 below). The existing directors and the company secretary of

<<<

 the Issuer will resign.
Step 7D - Partial repayment o f the Bond Debt
Following Step 1C, BP2 will lend the Partial Repayment Amount to the Issuer. The Issuer will authorise the release of the Partial Repayment Amount from the CMS Client Account

<<<

 to an account in the name o f the Bond Trustee immediately following the occurrence of Step 10 below.
The Bond Debt will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the aggregate of US $1 and the Partial Repayment Amount and a corresponding amount

<<<

 of Outstanding Bonds will be cancelled in the VPS. It is proposed that the Bond Trustee (acting in its capacity as the New Bond Trustee) will be authorised to distribute the Partial Repayment Amount as contemplated in paragraph 2.7 below.
Step

<<<

 7E - The Bond Exchange
Following Step 7D, the Issuer will instruct the Paying Agent to transfer the Outstanding Bonds that remain following Step 7D (the "Remaining Bonds") to Newco whereupon Newco will become the beneficial owner of the Remaining

<<<

 Bonds and the sole Bondholder. In consideration for the transfer of the Remaining Bonds to BP2, Newco will issue the New Bonds to the Bondholders in the VPS pro rata to the Bondholders' holdings of Outstanding Bonds on the Record Date.
In connection

<<<

 with the issue of the New Bonds, Newco will enter into a new bond agreement (the "New Bond Agreement"). A term sheet in respect of the New Bonds is included at Appendix 1.
It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meeting will appoint Nordic Trustee

<<<

 ASA as bond trustee in respect of the New Bonds (the "New Bond Trustee") and authorise it to enter into the New Bond Agreement, a fee letter and the bank account pledge over a bank account in Newco's name (the "Newco Bank Account"). Newco will

<<<

 also enter into an agreement with DNB ASA as paying agent in respect o f the New Bonds.
Newco will use its best endeavours to ensure that the New Bonds are listed and admitted to trading on the Cayman Stock Exchange on or as soon as possible

<<<

 after Completion. Prior to the New Bonds being listed and admitted to trading on the Cayman Stock Exchange, it will not be possible for New Bondholders to trade the New Bonds as this could give rise to adverse tax consequences for Bondholders

<<<

.
Step 7F - BP2 acquires the Remaining Bonds; the Debt Sale Agreement is executed
Following Step 7E above, Newco and BP2 will enter into the Debt Sale Agreement pursuant to which Newco will transfer the Remaining Bonds to BP2 in exchange for

<<<

 the Debt Sale Consideration. Newco and BP2 will notify the Paying Agent that the beneficial interest in the Remaining Bonds has been transferred to BP2 under the terms of the Debt Sale Agreement and instruct the Paying Agent to
- 10-

hold

<<<

 the Remaining Bonds on behalf of BP2 in the VPS whereupon BP2 will become the beneficial owner o f the Remaining Bonds and the sole Bondholder.
As BP2 is not the holder of the Licences in respect of the Orlando Asset or the Kells Asset, the

<<<

 Issuer will enter into a guarantee in favour of Newco pursuant to which it will guarantee the obligations of BP2 under the Debt Sale Agreement (the "Iona Guarantee").
The Bond Trustee will release the Security over the assets o f the Issuer

<<<

, and all outstanding claims and liabilities of the Issuer to the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders.
Step 8 - Cancellation o f the Remaining Bonds
On the Business Day following the completion of Step 7F, BP2 and the Issuer will enter into an

<<<

 agreement to refinance an amount equal to approximately US $23.8 million of the Remaining Bonds as an intercompany loan between the Issuer and BP2.
BP2, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee will then enter into a deed of release to release all outstanding

<<<

 amounts under or in connection with the Bond Agreement and the Remaining Bonds. The Remaining Bonds will be cancelled in the VPS. The obligations of the Huntington Subsidiaiy under the Bond Agreement and the Huntington Confirmation will not

<<<

 be released.
Upon the cancellation of the Remaining Bonds, the Bond Trustee will cease to act as the Bond Trustee and the Issuer will ask the Nordic ABM to delist the Remaining Bonds.
Step 9 --The administration o f the Issuer terminates
Following

<<<

 the completion of all of the Steps set out above, the Joint Administrators will enter into the necessary documentation required in order for them to cease to act as administrators to the Issuer and the Issuer will cease to be in administration

<<<

. The employment contracts of the remaining employees o f the Issuer will also be terminated.
Step 10 - The Bridge Lender executes its security documents
Immediately following Step 9, the Bridge Lender, the Hedge Counterparty, BP2 and the Issuer

<<<

 will enter into the documents in respect of the Bridge Acquisition Financing.
Step 11 - Payments made from the CMS Client Account and Completion
Immediately following the occurrence of Step 10, CMS will be instructed to release the funds held

<<<

 in the CMS Client Account. Completion will occur when (i) the Bond Trustee has received the Partial Repayment Amount, and (ii) the Supervisors have received the CVA Funding Amount.
Step 12 --Declaration o f a CVA distribution
Following the

<<<

 adjudication of Unsecured Creditors' claims in the CVA, the Supervisors will declare and pay a dividend from the CVA Fund to each of the Unsecured Creditors entitled to receive a dividend in accordance with the terms o f the CVA.
Step 13 -

<<<

-Final stnicture andfuture receipts by Newco
Newco will pay the net amounts of Deferred Consideration, Early Deferred Consideration, the Acceleration Payment (if any) and the Liquidated Settlement Payment (if any) that it receives under the

<<<

 Debt Sale Agreement to the New Bondholders on a quarterly basis in accordance with the terms of the New Bond Agreement, subject to:
- 11 -

(a) Newco's right to deduct an amount from the Early Deferred Consideration and/or the Deferred Consideration

<<<

 so as to ensure that at all times Newco has a cash balance in the Newco Bank Account of not more than US $500,000 to cover its ongoing running costs over the term of the New Bonds; and
(b) Newco's obligation to pay a pro rata share of the Deferred

<<<

 Consideration, Early Deferred Consideration, the Acceleration Payment (if any) and the Liquidated Settlement Payment (if any) to the Managers under the Payment Plan (as defined below).
A diagram of the position following Completion is set out

<<<

 at Appendix 2.
2.5 Amendments to the Bond Agreement
As noted at Step 6A above, before the steps outlined in Step 7 above can occur, it is necessary for the Bond Agreement to be amended to provide that, with effect from the date of the Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting:
(a) clauses 9.6 and 9.7 of the Bond Agreement, and the definition of "PIK Interest" and "PIK Bonds", will be deleted in their entirety, so that the Issuer will no longer be required to pay PIK Interest or issue PIK Bonds on the Outstanding

<<<

 Bonds;
(b) Bondholders will not be entitled to bring any claim against the Issuer in respect of any entitlement prior to the date o f the Bondholders' Meeting to be issued PIK Bonds under clause 9.6(b) of the Bond Agreement and any entitlement

<<<

 to be issued PIK Bonds is irrevocably waived;
(c) notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Issuer shall continue to pay cash interest on the Outstanding Bonds at the rate of 9.50 per cent, per annum, and (ii) the Issuer shall continue to be liable

<<<

 for the full amount of the Outstanding Bonds and all amounts of accrued and unpaid interest (including default interest) thereon;
(d) notwithstanding clause 11.6 of the Bond Agreement, any payment made to Bondholders under the Bond Agreement

<<<

 will be applied only in or toward repayment of amounts due but unpaid under the Bond Agreement (other than any amounts relating to interest of any kind), pro rata and without reference to any preference or priority of any kind; and
(e) all

<<<

 amounts payable by the Guarantors will be paid in a single lump sum payment within five Business Days of the date on which (in the case of the Huntington Subsidiary) the Joint Administrators and the Bond Trustee agree in writing that no further

<<<

 recoveries are capable of realisation.
The Issuer therefore proposes that the Bondholders' Meeting approves an amendment to the Bond Agreement on these terms to be documented by way of an amendment agreement to be entered into by the Issuer

<<<

 and the Bond Trustee prior to the occurrence o f Step 6A.
2.6 Newco structure
Newco was incorporated as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands on 12 May 2016. Newco's shares are held on trust by Estera Trust (Cayman) Limited ("Estera") for

<<<

 charitable purposes. Neither the Bond Trustee (in its capacity as bond trustee in respect of the New Bonds) nor any of the New Bondholders has or will have any shareholding in Newco. Newco has been incorporated with an authorised share capital

<<<

 of US $50,000 of which 250 shares of US $1 each have been issued, which will be funded from the Residual Recoveries. Prior to Completion, the authorised share capital of
- 12-

Newco will be reduced to US $250 which shall be fully issued.

<<<

 Newco's board comprises two independent directors in the Cayman Islands appointed by Estera.
It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meeting approves the appointment of Nordic Trustee ASA as the New Bond Trustee in respect of the New Bonds.
The

<<<

 rights of the New Bondholders will be limited to the assets of Newco. Newco's only assets will be (a) its rights under the Debt Sale Agreement and the Iona Guarantee, and (b) the Newco Bank Account and the cash balance therein from time to

<<<

 time. The only security that will be granted by Newco in respect of the New Bonds will be a first priority charge over the Newco Bank Account, which will be pledged but not blocked, and out of which Newco will meet its obligations under the

<<<

 New Bonds and the Payment Plan (as defined below), and pay its running costs.
2.7 Payment of Residual Recoveries to the New Bondholders
On and from Completion, the Bond Trustee in its capacity as Bond Trustee and/or New Bond Trustee will have

<<<

 received, or will be entitled to receive, cash amounts in respect of:
(a) Recovery Actions under the Huntington Guarantee (if any);
(b) the West Wick Consideration;
(c) the Partial Repayment Amount; and
(d) the residual cash balances at the

<<<

 Issuer or the Huntington Subsidiary (if any).
In addition, the Bond Trustee holds the Escrow Retention Amount pursuant to the authority granted to it at the December Bondholders' Meeting (the amounts referred to in (a) to (d) above, and the

<<<

 Escrow Retention Amount being, together, the "Residual Recoveries").
It is proposed that the Bond Trustee (in its capacity as the New Bond Trustee) will be authorised to deduct from the Residual Recoveries the costs referred to in paragraphs

<<<

 2.8 and 2.9 below and to distribute (in its capacity as New Bond Trustee) the net proceeds from any Residual Recoveries following such deductions to the New Bondholders pro rata to their holdings of New Bonds at the time of such distribution

<<<

, which shall be on one or more such dates as the Bond Trustee in its discretion and acting reasonably considers appropriate.
The payment of any Residual Recoveries to the New Bondholders will not reduce the aggregate principal amount of the

<<<

 New Bonds.
2.8 Costs of Newco and the Transaction
The Issuer proposes that the reasonably incurred fees, costs and expenses of the legal advisers to the Bond Trustee, the Joint Administrators, the Supervisors and the Companies in connection

<<<

 with the Transaction (the "Transaction Costs") will be met out of the remaining cash available at the Issuer and, to the extent that there is insufficient cash available at the Issuer, the Huntington Subsidiary, subject to the Bond Trustee

<<<

's approval of such Transaction Costs.
The Joint Administrators' current expectation is that there will be sufficient remaining cash available at the Companies to meet the Transaction Costs. However, to the extent that there is insufficient

<<<

 cash available at the Companies to meet the Transaction Costs, it is proposed that the Bond Trustee is authorised at the Bondholders' Meeting to pay the balance of any outstanding Transaction Costs using the Residual Recoveries in its absolute

<<<

 discretion.
- 13 -

It is further proposed that any amounts remaining from the Residual Recoveries after payment of the Transaction Costs will be repaid by the Bond Trustee to the New Bondholders in the manner described at paragraph 2.7 above

<<<

. There will be costs incurred in connection with the incorporation and running of Newco which will need to be met until the Debt Sale Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms, which will depend on the life of the Orlando and Kells

<<<

 fields, but the Debt Sale Agreement has a termination longstop date of 1 January 2060. The costs associated with Newco can be divided into two categories: (a) one-off, upfront costs associated with its incorporation and the listing of the New

<<<

 Bonds, and (b) ongoing costs, including but not limited to payment of directors' salaries, and annual listing fees.
The upfront costs associated with Newco's incorporation, payment of share capital, listing and admission to trading on the Cayman

<<<

 Stock Exchange are expected to be approximately US $85,000 ("Newco's Upfront Costs"). It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meeting authorises Newco's Upfront Costs to be paid as a Transaction Cost in the manner outlined above.
The ongoing costs

<<<

 and expenses in running Newco are expected to be approximately US $30,000 per annum, plus any costs payable to the New Bond Trustee under the fee agreement to be entered into between the New Bond Trustee and Newco. Under the terms of the New

<<<

 Bonds, Newco will be entitled to deduct its annual costs and expenses from any amounts in respect of Early Deferred Consideration, Deferred Consideration, the Liquidated Settlement Payment (if any) or the Acceleration Payment (if any) paid

<<<

 to Newco by BP2 (or the Issuer under the Iona Guarantee) before making a mandatory prepayment under the New Bonds. However, until the date on which the Early Deferred Consideration and the Deferred Consideration are paid under the terms of

<<<

 the Debt Sale Agreement, Newco's ongoing annual costs will need to be otherwise provided for. To ensure that Newco has sufficient funding to meet its annual costs and expenses at all times, it is proposed that the Bond Trustee will be entitled

<<<

 to transfer from the Escrow Retention Amount to Newco an amount equal to US $500,000 to pay Newco's annual costs and expenses (the "Newco Expense Amount").
It is proposed that under the terms of the New Bond Agreement, Newco will be entitled

<<<

 to deduct from any amounts of Early Deferred Consideration, Deferred Consideration, the Acceleration Payment (if any) and the Liquidated Settlement Payment (if any) that Newco receives from BP2 such an amount as is required to top up the Newco

<<<

 Bank Account to an amount equal to the Newco Expense Amount, before paying the remaining balance that it has received from BP2 on a pari passu basis (i) to the New Bondholders as a mandatoiy prepayment under the New Bonds, and (ii) to the Managers

<<<

 in accordance with the terms of the New Payment Plan Agreement (see paragraph 2.9 below).
To the extent that the Joint Administrators conclude that there are potentially viable Recovery Actions, funding would be required to enable the investigation

<<<

 and pursuit of the Recovery Actions. In addition, the Bond Trustee (in its capacity as Bond Trustee, Security Agent and/or New Bond Trustee) will not be indemnified by the Bondholders in connection with implementing the Transaction but may

<<<

 incur fees, costs, expenses and other liabilities in connection with the Transaction.
It is therefore proposed that the Bond Trustee is authorised to retain an amount equal to US $2 million (the "NT Completion Retention Amount") from the Escrow

<<<

 Retention Amount in order:
(a) potentially to fund Recovery Actions to the extent that the Joint Administrators of the Huntington Subsidiary have confirmed to the Bond Trustee that such Recovery Actions are viable and could reasonably be expected

<<<

 potentially to result in further recoveries;
(b) to make the NT Payment Plan Payments (as defined below); and
(c) to provide the Bond Trustee with cost cover to meet any potential fees, costs, expenses and liabilities that it may incur in connection

<<<

 with the Transaction (in its capacity as Bond Trustee, Security Agent, New Bond Trustee or otherwise).
- 14-

Following the payment of any amounts covered by (a) to (c) above, the Bond Trustee (in its capacity as the New Bond Trustee) will

<<<

 distribute the balance o f the NT Completion Retention Amount to the New Bondholders pro rata to their holdings of New Bonds at the time of such distribution, which shall be on one or more such dates as the Bond Trustee in its discretion (acting

<<<

 reasonably) considers appropriate.
BP2 will be responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction.
2.9 Managers' Payment Plan
During the course of the administration, the Joint Administrators entered into

<<<

 an arrangement (the "Payment Plan") with six members of the management team of the Issuer (the "Managers") as the Joint Administrators considered that it was advantageous to incentivise the Managers to assist with the M&A Process, to negotiate

<<<

 and help deliver the Transaction, and to assist the Joint Administrators in managing the Issuer during the administration (including continuing appropriate emergency response cover and progressing other realisations). Pursuant to the Payment

<<<

 Plan, the Managers are each entitled to a pro rata share of a pool of proceeds comprising:
(a) 15% of proceeds generated in respect of the Orlando Asset; and
(b) 10% of other proceeds generated from other assets of the Issuer and the Huntington

<<<

 Subsidiary.
The Payment Plan was put in place by the Joint Administrators and payments made under it in the course of the administration of the Issuer will constitute expenses of the administration. However, in connection with the implementation

<<<

 of the Transaction, it is proposed that the Payment Plan will be replaced with a new agreement (the "New Payment Plan Agreement") to enable proceeds which are subject to the Payment Plan and which are payable on or after Completion to be paid

<<<

 as follows:
(a) the Joint Administrators (in their capacity as administrators of Huntington) will pay amounts due under the Payment Plan up to and including Completion out of the unrestricted cash in Huntington;
(b) to the extent not paid under

<<<

 (a) above, the New Bond Trustee will pay amounts due under the Payment Plan which become payable on and following Completion out of the NT Completion Retention Amount (the "NT Payment Plan Payments"); and
(c) Newco will pay amounts due under

<<<

 the Payment Plan which relate to proceeds in respect of Early Defen-ed Consideration, Deferred Consideration, the Acceleration Payment (if any) and the Liquidated Settlement Payment (if any) if and when Newco receives such proceeds under the

<<<

 terms of the Debt Sale Agreement.
Newco will be authorised under the terms of the New Bond Agreement to deduct from the amounts it receives from BP2 under the Debt Sale Agreement such amounts as are required to pay amounts that are payable

<<<

 under the Payment Plan to each of the Managers on each mandatory repayment date under the terms o f the New Bond Agreement.
It is therefore proposed that the Bond Trustee is authorised to enter into the New Payment Plan Agreement in order to

<<<

 authorise it to make the NT Payment Plan Payments from the NT Completion Retention Amount.

 expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposals (including but not limited to the information contained in the Summons).

5. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSALS

5.1 The Issuer's evaluation
In the opinion of the

<<<

 Joint Administrators, the Proposals represent the best way to maximise recoveries to Bondholders that is available in the current circumstances. The Transaction will allow the Issuer to be rescued as a going concern, maximise potential recoveries

<<<

 to the Bondholders and other stakeholders and achieve a better result for creditors than if the Issuer were to go into dissolution without the Transaction occurring.

5.2 Non-reliance
The Proposals are put forward to the Bondholders without

<<<

 further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee and nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate the Proposals and vote accordingly.
None of

<<<

 the Bond Trustee, the Joint Administrators or their respective advisers accepts any responsibility to Bondholders in relation to the impact of the Transaction and the Proposals on Bondholders' tax or accounting affairs. Each Bondholder should

<<<

 consult their own independent legal advice in relation to any tax and/or accounting implications of the Transaction and the Proposals.

5.3 Pre-acceptance
The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that Bondholders holding in excess of 71% of

<<<

 the Outstanding Bonds have indicated their support for the Proposals and that they will provide irrevocable undertakings ahead of the Bondholders' Meeting.

6. BONDHOLDERS' MEETING Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' Meeting:

To approve the Proposals, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a

<<<

 quorum, at least 5/10 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depositoiy (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve

<<<

 as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm: (a) the owner of the bonds, (b) the

<<<

 aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds, and (c) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered. The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a

<<<

 proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter

<<<

 for further details). In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which

<<<

 the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds. For practical puiposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond
