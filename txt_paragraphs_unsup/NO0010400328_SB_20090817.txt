NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
According to the Borrower

<<<

, and as'Llescribed in more detail in the Company Update, the Borrower urgently needs to raise additional funding to complete its work programs. The plan is to raise funding of approximately NOK 60 million through a rights issue directed towards

<<<

 the current shareholders. The rights issue will be underwritten by Lakeshore International Buyout Fund ("Lakeshore"). Depending on the participation by current shareholders through subscriptions in the rights issue, Lakeshore could become the

<<<

 owner of more than 50% of the shares of the Borrower, which would be characterized as a Change of Control Event according to the Loan Agreement, and would trigger a Put Option for the Bondholders according to clause 10.3. A Put Option would

<<<

 effectively defeat the purpose of the Rights Issue, and it is therefore set as a condition by Lakeshore for underwriting the share issue, that the Bondholders waive the Change of Control Put Option in relation to the particular share issue

<<<

 described in the Company Update.
2. Proposal
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes in the Loan Agreement as set out in this section (the "Proposal"). The

<<<

 Borrower proposes that the Bondholders grant a time limited waiver as follows:
The Bondholders waive the Change of Control Put Option under clause 10.3 of the Loan Agreement. The waiver shall be effective for a period of two months from the

<<<

 date of the Bondholders Meeting. The scope of the waiver is limited to Change of Control events occurring during the time the waiver is effective.
4. Evaluation of the Proposal
4.1 The Borrowers evaluation of the Proposal
The Borrower will

<<<

 propose to its Extraordinary General Meeting ("EGM") on 25 August to approve several equity offerings in an amount of NOK 60 million of which NOK 9 million will be a placing to and the balance of NOK 51 million will be offered to existing shareholders

<<<

 (the "Rights Issue"). In addition, further shares may be issued to pay related underwriting fees. The equity offerings will be fully subscribed or underwritten once approved by the EGM.
If existing shareholders do not utilise their subscription

<<<

 rights in a sufficient number the Underwriter of the Rights Issue will subscribe for unsubscribed shares which would lead to a Change of Control Event. It is a condition by the Underwriter that the outstanding loans of the Borrower stay in

<<<

 place and hence the exercise of the put option under these circumstances would jeopardize the equity raising.
The Borrower is of the firm opinion that the raising of further equity will significantly improve the situation of all lenders.

Aladdin Oil &Gas Company ASA
Background
Aladdin Oil & Gas Company ASA ("the Company") is a Norwegian based exploration and production company, headquartered in Oslo and listed on

<<<

 the Norwegian OTC market under the ticker code AOGC. The Company owns the following Russian oil companies: OOO Geotechnologia which owns two oil- and gas licenses in the Timan Pechora Province in North-West Russia; as well as Company ZAO Orneftegaz

<<<

 and OOO Veselovskoye with a combined ownership of six oil licenses in the Orenburg Area.
Financial Situation
On 15 October, 2008 the Company agreed an equity placing with the Cypriote company Venatino Ltd ("Venatino") whereby the latter subscribed

<<<

 shares for a total of NOK 155 million. The placing should take place in three tranches with the last and largest tranche to take place in January 2009. The issue price agreed was NOK 7.70 per share.
In January Venatino declared that it was

<<<

 not able to meet its commitments under the third tranche in its entirety due to general problems as a result of the downturn in the world economy. As a result a rescheduled payment plan to be completed by the end of the second quarter was negotiated

<<<

.
As of today's date Venatino has paid in approximately NOK 80 million but it is now clear it will not be able to complete their commitment and has transferred its shares to Lakeshore International Buyout Fund ("Lakeshore").
The Company is now

<<<

 in a position where it needs to urgently explore alternative solutions for raising sufficient additional funds to cover both operating and development costs. Partly as a result of the one year maturity extension on the NOK 50 million bond issue

<<<

 maturing on 10 December 2009 the Company has negotiated and agreement with Lakeshore whereby Lakeshore will subscribe a NOK 9 million share placing and also underwrite a NOK 51 million rights issue. This funding will be sufficient for the Company

<<<

 to fulfil its various work programmes on its oil and gas licences. A further consequence of the equity issues described above could be that Lakeshore becomes an owner of more than 50% of the shares of the Company.
Apart from the necessary approvals

<<<

 required from the Company's shareholders a further condition for the funding agreement with Lakeshore is that the existing loans stay in place. Hence, it is of paramount importance to the Company that bondholders waive their put option in a

<<<

 Change of Control situation.
The Operating Situation
The Company intends to use additional operating liquidity to complete the work programme for 2009 for its 3 operating subsidiaries in Russia. By completing this work programme for 2009 the

<<<

 Company is of the opinion that it is close to be able to finance future operations with revenues from its production of oil and gas. The following elements of the 2009 work programme remains to be completed;
· Completion of the gas project

<<<

 in the MS licence. Start of production is estimated for the 4th quarter 2009. The negotiations of the final sales agreement based on the cooperation agreement with Komiregiongas (a subsidiary of Gasprom) are proceeding according to plan. Estimated

<<<

 volume is 150,000 cum per day for 2009 with increases as and when further wells are connected.
· Testing of gas wells of the MS licence according to international standards, the purpose being to (i) secure gas deliveries according to agreements

<<<

 and (ii) account for reserves according to SPE classification.
· Testing of oil discoveries in the MS licence before drilling new wells.
