") attached in Schedule 2 thereto.
The entry into of the Amendment Agreement is a condition precedent for the coming into effect o f the new bond financing made available to certain members of the Group for the purpose of financing the completion

<<<

 of the Vessels.
Attached hereto is a presentation prepared by the Parent Borrower providing information regarding the new financing from York Capital and the events and circumstances leading up to the Parent Borrower's acceptance of the offer

<<<

 from York Capital (Schedule 3 hereto). In this regard the Borrowers specifically note that the rights and interest of the Bondholders and the Loan Trustee under and in relation to the Second Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement will be

<<<

 subject to the terms and provisions of the attached intercreditor agreement (the "Intercreditor Agreement" attached in Schedule 4 hereto) to be made between, inter alia, the Loan Trustee as trustee for the Bondholders and Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA as trustee on behalf of the holders of the new bonds to be issued pursuant to a bond loan agreement which reflects the new financing arrangements with York Capital (the "York Bond Loan Agreement" - attached in Schedule 5 hereto).
To induce

<<<

 the Bondholders to vote in favour of the Proposal (as defined below), the Second Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement contains provisions whereby Bondholders will receive an offer to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Parent Borrower

<<<

, as further set out in the Second Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement. The offer to subscribe for these shares will be made to the Bondholders through the VPS within 14 days after the Effective Date (as defined in the Amendment Agreement

<<<

). Bondholders having sold or transferred Bonds before the offer to subscribe has been sent through the VPS will not be able to subscribe for shares based on their holding of Bonds which have been so sold or transferred.
The Parent Borrower

<<<

 has been in discussions with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders and certain other Bondholders which together hold in excess of 66 % % of the principal amount of the outstanding Bonds in each Tranche, in relation to the Proposal (as

<<<

 defined below). Bondholders which together hold in excess of 66 2A % of the principal amount of the outstanding Bonds in each Tranche have provided the Loan Trustee with irrevocable voting undertakings pursuant to which they each grant the

<<<

 Loan Trustee an irrevocable right to vote their bonds in favour of the Proposal at the Bondholder Meeting. It is expected that the Loan Trustee will take all actions contemplated by the Proposal prior to the Bondholder Meeting, having already

<<<

 received the aforementioned irrecovable voting undertakings from the requisite majority of Bondholders.
Bondholders are encouraged to read all attached documents.

Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve

<<<

 as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii

<<<

) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.) The individual bondholder may authorise the Loan Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves

<<<

 as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising NTM to vote, must then be returned to the Loan Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further

<<<

 details). In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee

<<<

 accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Loan Trustee, to notify the Loan Trustee by telephone

Presentation prepared by the Parent

<<<

 Borrower
In 2007, Cecon ASA (the "Company" or "Cecon") ordered three offshore construction vessels (collectively the "Vessels" or each "Hull 717", "Hull 718" or "Hull 719") at Davie Yards (the "Yard") in Canada at a total combined cost of USD

<<<

 410 million.
In 2008/2009, financial problems at the Yard led to a renegotiation of the shipbuilding contracts, resulting in delayed delivery and an increased total price of USD 473 million. Davie Yards subsequently entered creditor protection

<<<

 in 2010, ultimately resulting in severe financial difficulties for Cecon.
The Vessels have so far been financed by equity in the amount of USD 109,620,000, a USD 200 million 1st lien loan facility related to all three Vessels from Export D

<<<

 evelopm ent Canada ("EDC") (the "EDC Facility"), and a USD 100 million 2nd lien bond issue (the "2007 Loan"). In total USD, 409,620,000 have been paid to the Yard to date.
In 2010, the Company was no longer able to service its debt, and efforts

<<<

 were made to restructure the Company's capital structure. An EGM was held in February 2011, and the bondholders in the 2007 Loan approved the restructuring in a bondholders meeting in March 2011. In the restructuring, the 2007 Loan and another

<<<

 USD 10 million bond loan issued in 2009 (the "2009 Loan"), as well as claims for accrued but not paid interest, w ere converted in part into a new USD 73.125 million bond loan and in part into equity in the Company. The new restructured bond

<<<

 loan was issued by two vessel owning companies within the Cecon Group to the bondholders of the 2007 Loan and the 2009 Loan, and guaranteed by the Company. As the Company was in immediate need of liquidity, the Company simultaneously issued

<<<

 a new U SD 7 m illion working capital bond (the "Tranche A Bonds"). The Tranche A Bonds is guaranteed by certain o f the vessel owning companies in the Group.
Bondholders in the 2007 Loan who participated in the new Tranche A Bonds, had their

<<<

 remaining existing bonds classified as "Tranche B Bonds" (current amount outstanding USD 56.8 million), whereas rem aining holders had their bonds classified as " Tranche C1 B onds" (current amount outstanding USD 13.8 million). Certain other

<<<

 claims, including the 2009 Loan, w ere converted into "Tranche C2 B onds" (current am ount outstanding USD 9.5 million). In addition, 65 million warrants for shares in the Company were issued to all the subscribers of the Tranche A Bond. The

<<<

 maturity of the warrants corresponded with the Tranche A maturity and was intended to provide sufficient funds to repay Tranche A at its maturity. The Tranche A to C2 Bonds are secured by, amongst other things, a first priority pledge over

<<<

 the shares in each of the Com pany's subsidiaries, a first priority charge of any intercompany debts owing to the Company, a second priority charge on any intercompany debt owing to the issuers of the Tranche B and C Bonds as well as a second

<<<

 ranking security over substantially all o f the other assets o f the issuers. The Tranche A Bonds rank senior to Tranche B and C Bonds, the Tranche B Bonds rank senior to the Tranche C Bonds. The EDC Facility holds first priority mortgages

<<<

 in the Vessels under construction, as well as first ranking security in all relevant equipment and assets currently in place to finish the construction of the Vessels.
The Loan Agreement as currently in force and governing the Tranche A - C

<<<

2 Bonds is available on www.stamdata.no, and the Company refers to its stock exchange announcements
L_3642770_V3 18.02.13 505587-023

and other information and documentation provided to the market for further details of the historic development

<<<

 of the Company.
The Company has since the restructuring been working to solve the situation at Davie Yards, to negotiate new shipbuilding contracts with new Yard owners, and to secure the necessary financing to complete the Vessels.
The Yard

<<<

 was acquired by ZM Industries in November 2012 (reference is made to stock exchange announcem ent dated 5th November, 2012). In N ovem ber 2012 an inspection o f Hull 717, its equipment and the Yard took place. An inspection report concluded

<<<

 that the quality of work on Hull 717 had been carried out to a high standard and estimated the degree of com pletion at 95% w ith respect to the hull and 40% w ith respect to outfitting. On 5th December 2012, Cecon entered into an agreement

<<<

 with EDC to acquire the EDC Facility for a price o f USD 27 million, im plying a debt reduction o f USD 173 m illion plus all accrued unpaid interest. The agreement with EDC to acquire the EDC Facility is, however, subject to the construction

<<<

 of the Vessels being re-initiated at the Yard in Canada within a short timeframe, a condition which again requires construction financing for all the Vessels to be in place. A new construction contract to complete the first vessel, being the

<<<

 Hull 717, has been agreed with the Yard at a fixed price of USD 69.5 million, and similar contracts have been entered into for Hull 718 and Hull 719, for prices o f USD 75 million and USD 100 million, respectively.
The Company has received

<<<

 a valuation from a recognized Norwegian shipbroker, which values each o f the Vessels at USD 160 - 165 million fully delivered. On the basis that the Company acquires the EDC Facility and concludes the York Financing, the contracts to complete

<<<

 construction of the vessels are deemed to be value accretive for all stakeholders in the Company.
The agreement with EDC requires Cecon to enter into construction contracts for all three Vessels with the Yard at terms acceptable to EDC. Accordingly

<<<

, Cecon is required to promptly address and find a sustainable solution for the funding of the completion of the Vessels. The Company has to date paid in total USD 409,620,000 on three the Vessels of w hich USD 300 million are loans. Unless

<<<

 the V essels are completed, it is likely that all funding provided by other stakeholders than EDC up to today will be lost, as Cecon's non vessel activity is relatively limited, currently providing a neutral EBITDA contribution, and hence cannot

<<<

 justify any significant debt levels. Cecon is consequently not in a position to be able to service its current USD 332 million of current debt obligations (included any accrued interest paid in kind ("PIK") and accrued but not paid interest

<<<

 to EDC).
The International Maritime Organisation sets certain regulations governing international shipping. As a result of delays in the construction of Hulls 717, 718 and 719, certain waivers were sought by Cecon and have been granted until

<<<

 October 2014.
Cecon has over the last 12 months w orked intensively w ith its advisors to establish the above mentioned construction financing of the Vessels. ABG Sundal Collier and Pareto Securities have been retained as the Company's financial

<<<

 advisors. A major effort has been made by the Company to review several funding options potentially available to the Company. Cecon has concluded that an offer from Y ork Capital (the "York Financing") represents the best alternative available

<<<

 to finance the completion of the Vessels and to maintain current and create further values for the stakeholders in the Company. Reference is made to the stock
L_3642770_V3 18.02.13 505587-023

exchange announcem ent on 2nd January 2013. The

<<<

 Y ork Financing includes USD 107.5 million to finance the completion of Hull 717, settlement of debt, working capital and acquisition of the EDC loan, and will accrue USD 25 million in PIK interest. In addition, the York Financing includes

<<<

 two tranches to fund Hull 718 and Hull 719, respectively, which are committed subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The York Financing requires a corporate restructuring whereby a new 100% owned subsidiary o f Cecon (Rever AS)

<<<

 is established for the purpose of owning the Vessel owning subsidiaries. Rever AS will be the borrower and will as part of the York Financing issue warrants, or an equal compensation, entitling York to acquire 15% o f the shares o f Rever AS

<<<

. It is the intention o f the Company and Y ork to prepare R ever AS for a separate listing w ithin a period o f 18 months.
The York Financing has been considered as the most competitive and attractive funding solution for Cecon due to inter

<<<

 alia the following reasons:
- York has provided a committed term sheet for a multi-tranche senior secured bond issue o f up to USD 107.5 million for the purposes o f purchasing the existing Export Development Bank of Canada Loan, providing

<<<

 incremental working capital to Cecon, and funding the completion of construction of Hull 717 at the Yard.
- In addition, Y ork has made conditional construction financing o f up to USD 175 million available for Cecon for the completion of Hulls

<<<

 718 and 719;
- the York Financing is thus, subject to certain conditions precedent, fully underwritten with significantly less execution risk than any other financing alternative currently available to the Company;
- the York Financing can

<<<

 be completed within an acceptable and relatively short timeframe, which is a necessity for Cecon to be able fulfil its contracts and agreements with the Yard and with EDC, as well as to comply with certain short term debt obligations; and


<<<

- the York Financing will run until delivery of each respective vessel and can then be refinanced with traditional long term senior secured take out financing.
For further details regarding the York Financing please refer to the press release

<<<

 published by the Company on 15 February 2013.
In sum, this is by Cecon deemed to be the most optimal and least risky alternative available in order for the Company to realize the values currently locked in the three newbuildings. This financing

<<<

 from York will enable the Company to positively commence the process of completing the Vessels.
In order to execute the York financing, certain amendments to the existing bond agreement governing the existing bonds tranches A, B, C1 and C2

<<<

 respectively have to be made.

 Clarksons or RS Platou (the "Valuation") and has provided a copy of the same to the Second Security Agent (it being understood that such sale may take place thereafter at a price regardless of the Valuation). In the event the First Security

<<<

 less favourable to the Second Bondholders than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction with a person or entity which is not a Related Party). In the event the First Security Agent proposes to sell a Vessel or the shares

<<<

 in a Vessel Owner to a person or entity that is not a Related Party (1) the only non-cash consideration permitted to count towards the purchase price will be securities listed and trading on a recognised securities exchange or other reputable
