This Prospectus may contain forward-looking statements and assumptions regarding future market conditions, operations and results. Such forward-looking statements and information are based

 on the beliefs of the Company's management or are assumptions based on information available to the Group. The words "considers", "intends", "deems", "expects", "anticipates", "plans" and similar expressions indicate some of these forward-looking

<<<

 statements. Other such statements may be identified from the context. Any forward-looking statements in this Prospectus involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performances or achievements

<<<

 of the Group to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the

<<<

 Group's present and future business strategies and the environment in which the Group will operate in the future. Although the Company believes that the forecasts of, or indications of future results, performances and achievements are based

<<<

 on reasonable assumptions and expectations, they involve uncertainties and are subject to certain risks, the occurrence of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements and from

<<<

 past results, performances or achievements. Further, actual events and financial outcomes may differ significantly from what is described in such statements as a result of the materialisation of risks and other factors affecting the Group's

<<<

 operations. Such factors of a significant nature are mentioned in the section "Risk factors" below.

This Prospectus shall be read together with all documents that are incorporated by reference, see subsection "Documents incorporated by reference

RISK FACTORS
Risk and risk-taking is an inevitable part of investing in bonds. There are risks both regarding

<<<

 circumstances linked to the Issuer and the Group as a whole and those which bear no specific relation to the Issuer and/or the Group. In addition to the other information in the investor presentation relating to the Bonds as well as a general

<<<

 evaluation of external factors, investors should carefully consider the risk factors described below before making any investment decision. The occurrence of any of the events mentioned below risks having a material adverse effect on the Company

<<<

's and/or the Group's operations, financial position and results of operations. The risks presented in this document are not exhaustive, and other risks not at present known to the Group, or that the Group currently thinks are insignificant

<<<

 and therefore has not been included herein, is likely to also adversely affect the Group and the Group's ability to service its debt obligations under the Bonds. Prospective investors should consider carefully the information contained herein

<<<

 and make an independent evaluation before making any investment decision.
Please note that only a management interview has been conducted in relation to the issuance of the Bonds. No financial, insurance or tax due diligence has been conducted

<<<

. Thus, it is likely that there are risks relating to the Group and its business which have not been disclosed in the management interview and which are consequently not disclosed in this document.
The risk factors below are not given in any

<<<

 particular order.
Risks relating to the Group and the market
Certain risks relating to the business model and the projects The Group's main businesses are purchasing, owning, developing and managing properties in medium sized towns1 within

<<<

 commuting distance to the three largest cities in Sweden.
One of the main risks related to the Group's business is that some of the Group's tenants will terminate their lease agreements for vacation upon expiry in accordance with the terms

<<<

 of the lease agreements and that such terminations will have a negative impact on the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results. Further, the Group is dependent on that their tenants pay their rent on time and if several

<<<

 tenants simultaneous are unable to make their rental payments, there is a risk that such unability will have a negatively impact on the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results.
Geographical risks The supply and demand for

<<<

 properties and the return on property investments varies between different geographical markets and is likely to develop differently within geographical markets. If the demand for premises to lease declines in the markets in which the Group

<<<

 operates, there is a risk that such event will adversely affect the Company's operations, result and financial position.
Property risk Returns from the properties will largely depend on the rental income, the costs and expenses incurred in

<<<

 the asset management, refinement and property management, as well as on changes in the market value of the properties. Rental income and the market value of properties are affected by overall conditions in the economy, such as growth in gross

<<<

 domestic product, employment trends, inflation and changes in interest rates. There is a risk that both property value and rental income also will be affected by competition from other property owners, or the perceptions of

prospective

<<<

 tenants of the attractiveness, convenience and safety of the properties. Should the Group experience a decrease in its rental incomes or the market value of its properties, there is a risk that such events will result in a number of consequences

<<<

, such as a breach of the Group's covenants of financial arrangements with the result that such financial arrangements will be accelerated prior to maturity and consequently affect the liquidity of the Company. There is also a risk that a material

<<<

 decrease of the market value of the Properties will have a negative impact on the Company's possibilities to dispose of its Properties without incurring losses, and that such event will have a negative effect on the Groups' operations, financial

<<<

 position earnings and results.
Transaction risk Acquisitions of companies and properties is part of the Group's business. Such transactions are subject to risks and uncertainties. Property acquisitions, whether directly or through share acquisitions

<<<

 in property owning companies, involve, for example, environmental risks, financial risks, legal risks and risks of technical problems. A legal, financial and technical due diligence (and if required environmental due diligence) is being made

<<<

 before an investment with the purpose of identifying and if possible reducing the risks that are connected with the investment. However, the risks will only be reduced by taking such precautions and the acquisitions will thus involve certain

<<<

 risks relating to future operations, acquired companies or properties which are likely to have a negative effect on the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results.
Environmental risks According to the polluter pays-principle

<<<

 established in Swedish environmental law, the operator who has contributed to pollutions will be responsible for remediation. However, should it not be possible to locate the polluter, the property owner is subsidiary responsible for remediation

<<<

 and associated costs. Accordingly, there is a risk that the Group in its capacity as property owner will be held responsible for costly remediation. This risk will be exacerbated should the Group not have adequate environmental warranties in

<<<

 the agreements governing the acquisition of the Group's real property, whether directly or through share acquisitions in property owning companies.
Technical risks Property investments and property management always contain a technical risk

<<<

 related to the operations of the property, including, but not limited to, construction issues, hidden defects, damage (including through fire or other natural disasters) and pollution. There is a risk that these types of technical problems

<<<

 will result in significant unforeseen costs relating to the property. If one or several of the properties owned by the Group encounters any technical issues in the future there is a risk that the costs relating to such property substantially

<<<

 increases and have a negative effect on the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results.
Global economic and market conditions The recent economic downturn and uncertainty on the international financial markets have had an

<<<

 adverse impact on the global economy. There is a risk that any market turbulence or further downturns in the global economy will affect the financial position of the Group's tenants and impact their ability to pay their rent and conduct business

<<<

 with the Group. There is a risk that any decrease in the global economy or any decrease in demand for the Group's properties will adversely impact the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results.
Competitive landscape The Group

<<<

 operates in a competitive industry where the future competitive opportunities, amongst others, are dependent on the Group's ability to be at the forefront and rapidly react on current and future market needs. There is a risk the competitors

<<<

 grow stronger in the future, for example, by means of further consolidation in the relevant markets. If the Group is not be able to compete

6 (65)
successfully against current as well as future competitors, there is a risk that such event

<<<

 will have a negative effect on the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results.
Organisational risks The Company has a small organisation which means that the Group depends largely on the skills, experience and commitment of

<<<

 its key employees and management. If the Group should become unable to retain or recruit such persons, there is a risk that such event will adversely impact the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results.
Negative publicity

<<<

 There is a risk that negative publicity or announcement relating to the Group will, regardless of whether justified, deteriorate the brands' value and have a negative effect on the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results

<<<

.
Borrowing by the Group and interest risk The Group has incurred, and have a right to, in compliance with the limits set out in the terms and conditions of the Bonds, further incur, financial indebtedness to finance its business operations

<<<

. There is a risk that such financing generate interest costs which will be higher than the gains produced by the investments made by the Group. Borrowing money to make investments will increase the Group's exposure to the loss of capital and

<<<

 higher interest expenses. Further, the majority of the Group's financing agreements carry floating rates of interest which means that the Group is exposed to changes in interest rates in relation to such financing agreements. The interest rates

<<<

 are affected by a number of factors that are beyond the control of the Group, including but not limited to the interest rate policies of governments and central banks in the geographical markets in which the Group operates. An increase in interest

<<<

 rates will entail an increase in the Group's interest obligations, which risks having a negative effect on the Groups' operations, financial position, earnings and results. To manage some of its interest rate exposure, the Group have entered

<<<

 into interest derivative contracts. Such interest derivative contracts do however only hedge a small proportion of the Group's total interest rate exposure and expires during 2017, which means that the majority of its financing arrangements

<<<

 that carries floating rates of interest are exposed to interest risk. It is possible that such hedging will not afford the Group sufficient protection against adverse effects of interest rate movements. Moreover, the success of any hedging

<<<

 activities is highly dependent on the accuracy of the Group's assumptions and forecasts. There is a risk that all erroneous estimations that affect such assumptions and forecasts will have a material adverse effect on the Group's operations

<<<

, financial position, earnings and results.
Insurance If the Group is unable to maintain its insurance cover on terms acceptable to it, or if future business requirements exceed or fall outside the Group's insurance cover, or if the Group's

<<<

 provisions for uninsured costs are insufficient to cover the final costs, there is a risk that such events will adversely impact the Group's operations, financial position, earnings and results.
Tax related risks The Group conducts its business

<<<

 in accordance with its own interpretation of applicable tax regulations and applicable requirements and decisions. There is a risk that the Group's or its advisers' interpretation and the Group's application of laws, provisions, judicial practice

<<<

 has not been, or will in the future not be, correct or that such laws, provisions and practice will be changed, potentially with retroactive effect. If such an event should occur, the Group's tax liabilities can increase, which risks having

<<<

 a negative effect on the Group's results and financial position. There is also a risk that revisions to tax regulations, for example, comprise denied interest deductions, additional taxes on the direct or indirect sale of property and/or tax

<<<

 losses carried forward being forfeited, have a negative effect the Group's results and financial position in the future.

7 (65)
Ability to comply with the terms and conditions for the Bonds The Issuer is required to comply with the terms

<<<

 and conditions for the Bonds. Events beyond the Group's control, including changes in the economic and business conditions in which the Group operates, risks affecting the Issuer's ability to comply with, among other things, the undertakings

<<<

 set out in the terms and conditions for the Bonds. There is a risk that a breach of the terms and conditions for the Bonds will result in a default under the terms and conditions for the Bonds, which will negatively effect the Group's operations

<<<

, results and financial position.
Ability to service debt The Issuer 's ability to service its debt under the Bonds will depend upon, among other things, the Group's future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing

<<<

 economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond the Group's control. If the Group's operating income is not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, the Group will be forced

<<<

 to take actions such as reducing or delaying its business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional equity capital. There is a risk that this will

<<<

 negatively effect the Group's operations, earnings, results and financial position.
Credit risk Where there is a risk that the Group's counterparties will be unable to fulfil their financial obligations towards the Group, the Group is exposed

<<<

 to credit risk. There is a risk that the financial situation of the Group's current and potential tenants and other counterparties become such that they cannot pay the agreed rent or other amounts owed to the Group as they fall due or otherwise

<<<

 fail to fulfil their obligations. There is a risk that this will adversely affect the Group's operations, earnings, results and financial position.
Issuer's dependence on other companies in the Group The Issuer is a holding company and holds

<<<

 no significant assets other than the ownership in its subsidiaries. The Issuer therefore depends on the receipt of sufficient income and cash flow related from the operations of the subsidiaries. Consequently, the Issuer is dependent on the

<<<

 subsidiaries' availability of cash and their legal ability to pay dividends, which from time to time risks being restricted by corporate restrictions and law. A decrease in any such income and cash flow risks having a material adverse effect

<<<

 on the Issuer's financial condition and its ability to service its debt under the Bonds. Further, a few members of the Group have entered into financing arrangements limiting such companies' abilities to pay dividends and other distributions

<<<

. If the group companies in the future enter into further similar financing arrangements, there is a risk that it will have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's financial condition and its ability to service its debt under the Bonds.
Changes

<<<

 in legislation Various pieces of legislations and regulations (including, without limitation, competition regulations, land law, environmental regulations and taxes) affect the business conducted by the Group. There is a risk that new or amended

<<<

 legislation and regulations will call for unexpected costs or impose restrictions on the development of the business operations and have an adverse effect on the Group's business, operations, earnings, results and financial position.
Legal

<<<

 disputes There is a risk that claims or legal action in the future will be taken against the Group and have significant unfavourable effects on the Group's financial position, operations, earnings, results, performance, and market position

<<<

 or pricing of the Bonds.

8 (65)
Risks relating to the Bonds
Credit risks Investors in the Bonds assume a credit risk relating to the Group. The payments to bondholders under the terms and conditions are therefore dependent on the Group's

<<<

 ability to meet its payment obligations, which in turn is largely dependent upon the performance of the Group's operations and its financial position. The Group's financial position is affected by several factors, some of which have been mentioned

<<<

 above. There is a risk that an increased credit risk will cause the market to charge the Bonds a higher risk premium, which will have an adverse effect on the value of the Bonds. Another aspect of the credit risk is that a decline in the financial

<<<

 position of the Group risks reducing the prospects of the Group to receive debt financing when the Bonds mature.
Refinancing risk The Group is likely to eventually be required to refinance certain or all of its outstanding debt, including the

<<<

 Bonds. During 2016, the Group will need to refinance a total amount of SEK 150,000,000 under certain of the Group's financing arrangements. The Group's ability to successfully refinance its debt depends, among other things, on the conditions

<<<

 of the bank market, the capital markets and the Group's own financial condition at such time. There is a risk that the Group's access to financing sources will not be available on favourable terms or not available at all. There is also a risk

<<<

 that the Group's inability to refinance its debt obligations on favourable terms, or to refinance them at all, will have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, operations, earnings and results and on the prospects of recovery by

<<<

 the bondholders under the Bonds.
Interest rate risks The Bonds' value depends on several factors, one of the most significant over time being the level of market interest. Investments in the Bonds involve a risk that the market value of the

<<<

 Bonds will be adversely affected by changes in market interest rates.
Liquidity risks The Group intends to apply for listing of the Bonds on NASDAQ Stockholm. However, there is a risk that the Bonds will not be admitted to trading. Further

<<<

, in the event that the Bonds are admitted to trading on a regulated market, active trading in the Bonds does not always occur and hence there is a risk that a liquid market for trading in the Bonds will not form or will not be maintained, even

<<<

 if the Bonds are listed. As a result, there is a risk that the bondholders will be unable sell their Bonds when they so desire or at a price level which allows for a profit comparable to similar investments with an active and functioning secondary

<<<

 market or for a sale at par. There is a risk that lack of liquidity in the market will have a negative impact on the market value of the Bonds. Furthermore, there is a risk that the nominal value of the Bonds will not be indicative of the market

<<<

 price of the Bonds if the Bonds are admitted for trading on NASDAQ Stockholm, as the Bonds risk trade below their nominal value (for instance, to allow for the market's perception of a need for an increased risk premium).
It should also be

<<<

 noted that during any given period of time there is a risk that it will be difficult or impossible to sell the Bonds (at all or at reasonable terms) due to, for example, severe price fluctuations, close-down of the relevant market or trade

<<<

 restrictions imposed on the market.
Risk of the market price of the Bonds being volatile There is a risk that the market price of the Bonds will be subject to significant fluctuations in response to general market conditions (including, without

<<<

 limitations, actual or expected changes in prevailing interest rates), actual or anticipated variations in the Group's operating results and those of its competitors, adverse business developments, changes to the regulatory environment in which

<<<

 the Group operates, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and the actual or expected sale of a large number of Bonds, as well as other factors. In addition, in recent years the global

9 (65)
financial markets have experienced

<<<

 significant price and volume fluctuations, which, if repeated in the future, risk adversely affect the market price of the Bonds without regard to the Group's operating results, financial condition or prospects.
Unsecured obligations The Bonds

<<<

 constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer. This means that in the event of bankruptcy, re-organization or winding-up of the Issuer, the bondholders normally receive payment after any priority creditors

<<<

 have been fully paid.
Structural subordination and insolvency of subsidiaries All assets are owned by, and all revenues are generated in, the subsidiaries of the Issuer. The subsidiaries are legally distinct from the Issuer and have no obligation

<<<

 to make payments to the Issuer of any profits generated from their business. The ability of the subsidiaries to make payments to the Issuer is restricted by, among other things, the availability of funds, corporate restrictions and legal restrictions

<<<

 (e.g. limitations on value transfers). Further, a few members of the Group have entered into financing arrangements limiting such companies' abilities to pay dividends and other distributions.
There is a risk that the Group or its assets will

<<<

 not be protected from any actions by the creditors of any subsidiary of the Group, whether under bankruptcy law, by contract or otherwise. In addition, defaults by, or the insolvency of, certain subsidiaries of the Group risks resulting in

<<<

 the obligation of the Group to make payments under parent company financial or performance guarantees in respect of such subsidiaries' obligations or the occurrence of cross defaults on certain borrowings of the Group.
Security over assets

<<<

 granted to third parties Subject to certain limitations from time to time, the Issuer has a right to incur additional financial indebtedness and provide additional security for such indebtedness. If security is granted in favour of a third

<<<

 party debt provider, the bondholders will, in the event of bankruptcy, re-organisation or winding-up of the Issuer, be subordinated in right of payment out of the assets being subject to security provided to such third party debt provider.

<<<

 In addition, if any such third party debt provider holding security provided by the Group were to enforce such security due to a default by any company within the Group under the relevant finance documents, such enforcement risks having a material

<<<

 adverse effect on the Group's assets, operations and, ultimately, the financial position of the bondholders.
Risks related to early redemption Under the terms and conditions for the Bonds, the Issuer has reserved the possibility to redeem all

<<<

 outstanding Bonds before the final redemption date. If the Bonds are redeemed before the final redemption date, the holders of the Bonds have the right to receive an early redemption amount which exceeds the nominal amount in accordance with

<<<

 the terms and conditions for the Bonds. However, there is a risk that the market value of the Bonds is higher than the early redemption amount and that it will not be possible for bondholders to reinvest such proceeds at an effective interest

<<<

 rate as high as the interest rate on the Bonds and will only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. It is further possible that the Issuer will not have sufficient funds at the time of the mandatory prepayment to carry out the required

<<<

 redemption of Bonds.
No action against the Issuer and bondholders' representation Under the terms and conditions for the Bonds, the bond trustee will represent all bondholders in all matters relating to the Bonds and the bondholders are prevented

<<<

 from taking unilateral actions against the Issuer or any other Group company. Consequently, individual bondholders do not have the right to take legal actions to declare any default by claiming any payment from or enforcing any

10 (65)
security

<<<

 granted by the Issuer or any other Group company and therefore have no effective legal remedies unless and until a requisite majority of the bondholders agree to take such action. However, there is a risk that an individual bondholder, in certain

<<<

 situations, will take unilateral action against the Issuer or any other Group company (in breach of the terms and conditions for the Bonds). There is a risk that this will adversely affect an acceleration of the Bonds or other actions against

<<<

 the Issuer or any other Group company.
To enable the bond trustee to represent bondholders in court, the bondholders and/or their nominees will have to submit separate written powers of attorney for legal proceedings. If the bondholders fail

<<<

 to submit such a power of attorney, there is a risk that this will negatively affect the legal proceedings.
Under the terms and conditions for the Bonds, the bond trustee will in some cases have the right to make decisions and take measures

<<<

 that are binding upon all bondholders. Consequently, there is a risk that the actions of the bond trustee in such matters will impact a bondholder's rights under the terms and conditions for the Bonds in a manner that will be undesirable for

<<<

 some bondholders.
Bondholders' meetings The terms and conditions for the Bonds will include certain provisions regarding bondholders' meetings. Such meetings is likely to be held in order to decide on matters relating to the bondholders' interests

<<<

. The terms and conditions for the Bonds will allow for stated majorities to bind all bondholders, including bondholders who have not taken part in the meeting and those who have voted differently to the required majority at a duly convened

<<<

 and conducted bondholders' meeting. Consequently, there is a risk that the the actions of the majority in such matters will impact a bondholder's rights in a manner that will be undesirable for some of the bondholders.
Restrictions on the transferability

<<<

 of the Bonds The Bonds have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any U.S. state securities laws. Subject to certain exemptions, a holder of the Bonds can not offer or sell the Bonds in the

<<<

 United States. The Issuer has not undertaken to register the Bonds under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws or to effect any exchange offer for the Bonds in the future. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered the Bonds

<<<

 under any other country's securities laws. It is each bondholder's and each succeeding investor's obligation to ensure that their respective offers and sales of the Bonds on the secondary market comply with all applicable securities laws. Should

<<<

 any investor violate the transfer restrictions that apply to the bonds there is a risk that such investor will violate applicable securities laws.
Risks relating to the clearing and settlement in Euroclear's book-entry system The Bonds will

<<<

 be affiliated to Euroclear's account-based system, and no physical notes will be issued. Clearing and settlement relating to the Bonds will be carried out within Euroclear's bookentry system as well as payment of interest and repayment of the

<<<

 principal. Investors are therefore dependent on the functionality of Euroclear's account-based system for clearing, settlement, payment and other matters or functionalities in respect of the Bonds addressed by Eurolcear's account-based system

<<<

.
Amended or new legislation This document is, and the terms and conditions for the Bonds will be, based on Swedish law applicable to such documents and the Bonds in force at the date of issuance of the Bonds. No assurance can be given on the

<<<

 impact of any possible future legislative measures, regulations, changes or modifications to administrative practices or case law applicable to the Bonds, this document and the terms and conditions.
