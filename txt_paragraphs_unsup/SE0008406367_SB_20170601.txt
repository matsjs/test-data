<<<

 form, attached hereto as Schedule 1 (the "Voting Form"), and, if applicable, the power of attorney/authorisation, attached hereto as Schedule 2 (the "Power of Attorney") (in accordance with the instructions set out in Section 4.4 (Bonds registered

<<<

 with a nominee)) to the Agent). Please contact the securities firm through which you hold your Bonds if you do not know how your Bonds are registered or if you require authorisation or other assistance to participate.

<<<

.
To be eligible to participate in the Written Procedure, a person must meet the criteria for being a Holder on 9 June 2017 (the "Record Date"). This means that the person must be registered on a Securities Account with the CSD, as a direct

<<<

 registered owner (Sw. direktregistrerad ägare) or nominee (Sw. förvaltare) with respect to one or several Bonds.

1. Background
The Issuer is an investment company with the business concept of using experience, expertise and a widespread network

<<<

 to identify and invest in assets with considerable potential for value appreciation, with a focus on companies with network effects.
In June 2016, the Issuer issued a senior secured Bond in a total aggregate amount of SEK 300.000. 000. The

<<<

 purpose of the Bond issue was to refinance debt but also to finance general corporate purposes, which include investments in companies meeting the criteria stipulated in the previous paragraph. The Issuer is continuously investigating investment

<<<

 opportunities in order to grow and develop its business.
As communicated by the Issuer in a press release dated 1 June 2017, the Issuer is contemplating, subject to market conditions, the issuance of a new bond loan in a total initial amount

<<<

 of up to SEK 500,000,000 and with a total frame amount of SEK 800.000. 000, such bond loan to be unsecured but to rank pari passu with the Issuer's outstanding Bond loan. Currently, the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds only permit the incurrence

<<<

 of debt that is subordinated to the obligations of the Issuer under the Finance Documents. The Issuer is seeking greater flexibility to act upon potential future investment opportunities, and is therefore requesting the Holders' approval of

<<<

 an amendment to the Terms and Conditions to permit the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the existing Bond loan, provided that such Financial Indebtedness is unsecured and otherwise meets the conditions set forth

<<<

 in the Terms and Conditions for such incurrence, including inter alia that such new bond loan may not have redemption dates or instalment dates which occur prior to the final redemption date for the Bond loan. The Issuer proposes that an amendment

<<<

 is made in accordance with the proposal as further described in Section 2 below.
Furthermore, in connection with the above amendment, the Issuer is also requesting the Holders' approval to postpone the maturity date for the Delivery Hero Loan

<<<

 Receivable. According to the Terms and Conditions of the Bond loan, the Issuer has granted a loan to Delivery Hero Holding GmbH (now named Delivery Hero AG) with a nominal value of EUR 25,000,000 maturing on 1 September 2018. The Issuer's present

<<<

 and future money claims under the Delivery Hero Loan Receivable are pledged in favour of the Agent and the Holders. In accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Issuer shall procure that any proceeds from a repayment and prepayment of the

<<<

 Delivery Hero Loan Receivable are deposited promptly into the Deposit Account, where they shall constitute Transaction Security.
The Issuer is of the opinion that (i) an extension of the repayment date of the Delivery Hero Loan Receivable would

<<<

 be economically beneficial for the Issuer and (ii) that the Holders will not be negatively affected as the Delivery Hero Loan Receivable will remain pledged in favour of the Agent and the Holders. In addition, the Delivery Hero Loan Receivable

<<<

 will be repaid before the Final Redemption Date of the Bonds. The Issuer proposes that an amendment is made in accordance with the proposal as further described in Section 2 below.

<<<

4 (9)

A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Holders, irrespective of them responding in the Written Procedure.
4.3 Voting rights and

<<<

 authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must, on the Record Date 9 June 2017, be registered in the Issuer's debt register as:
(a) a direct registered owner of a Securities Account; or
(b) a nominee in a Securities

<<<

 Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.
4.4 Bonds registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different

<<<

 options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
(1) You can ask the nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
(2) You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the

<<<

 nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt

<<<

 register as Holder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a holder of the Securities Account as nominee or direct registered owner

<<<

.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than

<<<

 one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other

<<<

 assistance to participate. Bonds owned by Group Companies or (to the knowledge of the Issuer) their Affiliates do not entitle to any voting rights.

<<<

. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the Request under the Written Procedure.
If a quorum does not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the Issuer has confirmed that the relevant proposal has not

<<<

 been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure.
4.6 Majority
To approve the Request, at least two thirds (2/3) of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Holders reply in the Written Procedure

<<<

 must consent to the Request.
