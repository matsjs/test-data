 0584683 - 15.00 per cent Interoil Exploration & Production ASA Senior Callable Bond Issue 2010/2014

Oslo, April 13, 2012 Proposed changes to loan agreement - Summons to Bondholders' Meetings

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") is appointed

<<<

 as trustee for the abovementioned bond issue with ISIN NO 001 0584683 (the "Bond Loan") issued by Interoil Exploration & Production ASA (the "Issuer", the "Company" or "Interoil").

All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein

<<<

 shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Bond Loan dated 8 September 2010 (the "Loan Agreement").

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer is provided solely by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly

<<<

 disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1.

BACKGROUND

In an effort to strengthen the Company's financial position, the Issuer is hereby putting forward a proposal to the Bondholders to approve certain changes to the

<<<

 Loan Agreement.

Recently, a tax dispute involving Eksportconsult AS and Force Capital Partners AS has been resolved. The court ruled in favor of Eksportconsult AS and Force Capital Partners AS. This judgment entitles the Company to receive

<<<

 the Tax Refund Claims from Eksportconsult AS and Force Capital Partners AS. Under the Loan Agreement the Tax Refund Claims was assigned to the Bond Trustee as Security (defined in the Loan Agreement as the "Security Interest") for the Bond

<<<

. According to the Loan Agreement any amounts received under the Tax Refund Claims received by the Company shall be used to redeem bonds at the prevailing call premium which is currently 110% of par.

In light of this and in light of the successful

<<<

 farm-out of three Colombian blocks, the Company is seeking to improve its working capital in the short term to start investments in Colombia. Since the issuance of the Bond Loan in 2010, the Issuer has repaid approx. USD 50 million of the Preferred

<<<

 Senior Debt. Currently, the majority of the Issuer's cash flow from Peru and Colombia is used to repay senior bank debt, leaving little excess cash flow for investments.

As previously announced, the successful farm-outs by the Issuer have

<<<

 resulted in USD 50 million of reduced capital expenditure, while Interoil retains operatorship and 50% working interest in the three Colombian blocks. The farm-outs underpin the large value in the asset portfolio and the Company is of the opinion

<<<

 that continued investments in these prolific blocks will improve the Bondholders' asset backing in Colombia. Government approval will be required in order to effectuate the farm-outs, a process which is expected to take 6 to 9 months. It is

<<<

 therefore desirable to increase working capital in Colombia by initiating the investment program agreed with the farm-in partners independently of the final government approval.

In order to improve short term liquidity the Issuer is proposing

<<<

 that the Bondholders consent to: 1

(i) The Issuer retaining the Tax Refund

<<<

 Claim which is expected to be approximately NOK 45 million for an additional 12 months, to the effect that the amount of NOK 45 million shall be repaid at 105% of par (including accrued interest) on the interest payment date in March 2013.

<<<


(ii) A 10% fee on the retained tax receivable of NOK 45 million is paid as compensation to the Bondholders upon approval by the Bondholders' Meeting,
(iii) In order to increase security for the Bondholders, a revision of the existing dividend

<<<

 clause in the Loan Agreement to the effect that no dividends or distribution to shareholders will be permitted from the Issuer. Also, a new covenant is introduced whereby all cash flow from Subsidiaries to the Issuer other than existing contractual

<<<

 obligations and payment of ordinary overhead and administration expenses shall be retained in the Retention Account to service interest and repayment of the Bond Loan.
(iv) An amendment of the existing covenant in the Loan Agreement currently

<<<

 prohibiting the Issuer from incurring any new oil price hedging, in order to allow for potential new oil price hedging, provided such is on market terms and not having a material adverse impact for the Bond Loan. Not having the flexibility

<<<

 to implement such measures is unfavorable to both Bondholders and the Company.

2.

PROPOSED AMDENDMENTS TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT

In order to implement the proposals described in Clause 1 above, the Issuer proposes that the Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

 approve and adopt the following specific, interdependent amendments to the Loan Agreement (such proposed changes together referred to as the "Proposal"):

2.1

Postponed repayment of the Tax Refund Claim

In order to implement the postponed

<<<

 repayment, the Issuer proposes that Clause 10.4 of the Loan Agreement be amended as follows:

10.4 Tax refund
10.4.1 Notwithstanding anything in the Bond Agreement to the contrary the Parties agree that the Issuer shall retain the amount received

<<<

 under the Tax Refund Claim in its entirety.

10.4.2 Notwithstanding Clause 10.2 the Issuer shall repay NOK 45 million at 105% o f par value including accrued interest on the Interest Payment Date in March 2013.

10.4.3 The Issuers shall pay

<<<

 to the Bondholders a cash fee o f NOK 4.5 million on or about 4 May 2012. The paid amount shall be distributedpro rate between the Bonds. "

As a consequence of these amendments the definition under Clause 1.1 of "Security Interest" item (vi

<<<

) is deleted and item (vii) is renamed item (vi).

Finally the Pledge Agreement entered into between Interoil Exploration and Production ASA and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA regarding the Tax Refund Claims shall be deemed null and void. Norsk Tillitsmann

<<<

 ASA shall provide Exportconsult AS and Force Capital Partners AS with a notice stating that all claims under the Settlement Agreement dated 25 July 2008 (related to the Tax Refund Claims) are free from any encumbrances.

<<<

 obligations, ordinary overhead and administration expenses shall be deposited in and retained on the Retention Account at any and all time during the tenor o f the Bonds, and any such amounts deposited on the Retention Account to be released

<<<

 only to service interestpayments and repayments on the Bond."

As a consequence of the new Clause 13.3 (k) (iii), the Issuer proposes that the current Clause 13.3 (k) (ii) is amended to read as follows (proposed new text underlined):
"The amount

<<<

 standing to the credit o f Issuer on the Retention Account pursuant to Clause 13.3 Ik) Ii) above may only be used in the event o f an Event o f Default under the Bond Issue, whereby it shall be employed to pay the coupons under the Bonds."
