Summons to Bondholders' Meeting --proposal to make certain amendments of the Bond Agreement

1. INTRODUCTION
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders

<<<

 (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Latina Offshore Holding Limited (the "Company" or "Issuer").
Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned

<<<

 to them in the bond agreement originally entered into on 30 July 2014, as amended pursuant to an amendment agreement dated 24 August 2015 (the "Bond Agreement").
Reference is made to the information from the Company published on Stamdata on

<<<

 2 March 2016 (the "March Information Notice") and the Interim Accounts for first quarter 2016 and related press release published on the Parent's website 31 May 2016 (the "Interim Accounts Press Release").
The information in this summons regarding

<<<

 the Issuer and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons letter in its entirety.
2. BACKGROUND

<<<


As set out in the Interim Accounts Press Release, the Company had expected its modular rig (Modular 01, referred to as the "Modular") to commence operations under the drilling contract with Pemex in the second week of June 2016. However, the

<<<

 final approval from Pemex as required in order to commence operations was first given on 5 July 2016. After receiving such approval, the Modular has now been mobilized to its final destination and has commenced operations and rate has started

<<<

 to accrue under the drilling contract with Pemex.
Furthermore, similar to other offshore drilling contractors with operations in Mexico, the Company has during the last couple of months been in extensive dialogue with Pemex regarding possible

<<<

 amendments to its drilling contracts, namely for the two jack-ups, La Santa Maria and La Covadonga, and the Modular. These negotiations have proven to be difficult and lengthy, and are yet to be resolved.
Pursuant to the Bond Agreement, the

<<<

 Maturity Date of the Bond Issue is 31 July 2016 and as this is not a Business Day the Issuer should on 1 August 2016 have repaid the Bonds in full in accordance with Clause 10.1 of the Bond Agreement (the "Maturity Payment").

On 1 August 2016 the Issuer should further have paid an amount of USD1,250,000 representing interest on the Bonds in accordance with Clause 9.1 of the Bond Agreement (as amended) (the "July 2016 Interest Amount").

Pending

<<<

 completion of the negotiations with Pemex and to avoid a breach of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer is approaching the Bondholders to ask for their consent to extend the Maturity Payment, arrange for payment of the July 2016 Interest Amount and

<<<

 make ceitain amendments to the Bond Agreement as described herein.

The Issuer has retained Clarksons Platou Securities AS as financial advisor to assist in the review of financing and strategic opportunities.
