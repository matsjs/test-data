 Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned loan with ISIN NO 001 058092.1 (the "Loan") issued by Remedial Cayman Limited (the "Company

<<<

").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement governing the Bonds dated 28 June 2010 between the Company and the Loan Trustee (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated in this Summons

<<<

.
The information in this Summons regarding the legal, operational and financial status of the Company is provided by the Company. The Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information given from the

 Company.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Commencement o f Chapter 11 Proceedings
As Bondholders are aware, on 17 February 2010, Remedial (Cyprus) Public Company Limited ("Remedial Cyprus") filed a petition for relief under chapter 11 (the "Chapter 11 Proceedings

<<<

") of title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "US Bankruptcy Code") with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "US Bankruptcy Court").
On 26 February 2010, Remedial Cyprus filed a motion with

<<<

 the US Bankruptcy Court for orders under section 363 of the US Bankruptcy Code authorising it to sell substantially all of its business and assets to a nominee of the holders of the US$210 million FRN secured callable bonds 2007/12 issued by

<<<

 Remedial Cyprus (the "Remedial Cyprus Bonds"), subject to higher and better offers (the "Stalking Horse Bid"). No higher and better offers were received and, accordingly, the US Bankruptcy Court approved the Stalking Horse Bid as the successful

<<<

 bid.

2.2 Stalking Horse Bid
In order for the Company to be able to consummate the Stalking Horse Bid, it needed to be the sole holder of the Remedial Cyprus Bonds at the time of completion of the Remedial Cyprus Asset Purchase Agreement

<<<

 (as defined below). Accordingly, the holders of the Remedial Cyprus Bonds resolved on 10 March 2010 to transfer all of the Remedial Cyprus Bonds to the Company prior to completion of the Remedial Cyprus Asset Purchase Agreement in the event

<<<

 that the Stalking Horse Bid was approved as the successful bid.
Remedial Cyprus and the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement on 28 June 2010 in order to implement the Stalking Horse Bid, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire

<<<

 substantially all of the assets of Remedial Cyprus (the "Remedial Cyprus Asset Purchase Agreement"). Immediately prior to completion of the sale under the Remedial Cyprus Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company issued the Bonds and shares in

<<<

 the Company to the original holders of the Remedial Cyprus Bonds.
The Remedial Cyprus Asset Purchase Agreement provided for a split completion process in respect of (i) the assets (the "Yantai Assets") associated with the vessel (the "ESV1

<<<

 Vessel") being constructed pursuant to a construction contract (the "Yantai Construction Contract") entered into between Remedial Cyprus and Yantai Raffles Shipyard Limited ("Yantai") (now known as CIMC Raffles Offshore (Singapore) Limited

<<<

) (the "Subsequent Completion"), and (ii) all other assets of Remedial Cyprus to be acquired by the Company pursuant to the terms of the Stalking Horse Bid (the "Initial Completion"). The Initial Completion occurred on 28 June 2010.
2.3 Yantai

<<<

 and the ESV1 Vessel
On 16 April 2010, Remedial Cyprus received a cancellation notice from Yantai purporting to terminate the Yantai Construction Contract, citing entry into the Chapter 11 Proceedings as a default under the terms of the Yantai

<<<

 Construction Contract. Yantai then ceased work on the ESV1 Vessel. On 16 April 2010, Remedial Cyprus issued a letter to Yantai confirming that the notice was in violation of the automatic stay under the Chapter 11 Proceedings and the US Bankruptcy

<<<

 Code and, accordingly, was ineffective.
Since this time, the Advisers and, more latterly, the Company have been in discussions with Yantai in relation to finding a mutually beneficial solution with regard to the purported termination of the

<<<

 Yantai Construction Contract and the ability of the Company and Remedial Cyprus to effect the Subsequent Completion in accordance with the terms of the Remedial Cyprus Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company and Yantai have now agreed upon the

<<<

 terms of a proposed disposal of the Yantai Assets (including the Yantai Construction Contract) to a member of the Yantai group, the approval for which is being sought from Bondholders pursuant to the terms of this Summons.
3. YANTAI ASSET PURCHASE

<<<

 AGREEMENT
As a result of the discussions referred to in paragraph 2.3 above, the Company has entered into an asset purchase agreement with Coral Offshore Pte Limited (the "Purchaser") (a Singaporean company, which is an indirect subsidiary

<<<

 of Yantai) (the "Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company will sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will acquire from the Company, the Yantai Assets (including the Yantai

<<<

 Construction Contract).

N O R SK TIL L IT SM A N N ASA www. tTusrec.no

The terms of the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement include a termination right for either the Company or the Purchaser if, within 15 business days of the date of execution

<<<

 of the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company has not obtained the necessary consents from the Bondholders in relation to the disposal of the Yantai Assets. Accordingly, the approval of the Bondholders is now being sought in connection

<<<

 with the transactions contemplated by the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement and the disposal of the Yantai Assets.
The Yantai Purchase Agreement provides that the price for the proposed sale of the Yantai Assets would be US$55,000,000 (the "Purchase

<<<

 Price"). The Purchase Price would be paid in two instalments, firstly, through an initial payment of US$5,500,000 being made to the Company by the Purchaser on the date of completion of the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement, and, secondly, through

<<<

 the balance of the purchase price of US$49,500,000 (the "Purchase Price Balance") being paid to the Company on the date falling nine months following completion of the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement (subject to earlier payment in the event

<<<

 of the occurrence of certain defined events, e.g. a disposal of the ESVI Vessel by the Purchaser).
As security against payment of the Purchase Price Balance, Yantai, as the indirect parent company to the Purchaser, would enter into a corporate

<<<

 guarantee in favour of the Company (the "Corporate Guarantee"). Under the terms of the Corporate Guarantee, Yantai would guarantee the obligations of the Purchaser to pay the Purchase Price Balance when it falls due in accordance with the terms

<<<

 of the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement.
Additionally, as further security against payment of the Purchase Price Balance, the Purchaser would be required to deliver a standby letter of credit issued by China Construction Bank (the "Issuing Bank

<<<

"), and confirmed by one of the Hong Kong branches of Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC, Citibank, ING Bank or ABN (the "Confirming Bank"), in favour of the Company (the "Standby Letter of Credit"). The Standby Letter of Credit would be for US$

<<<

24,750,000 (representing 50% of the Purchase Price Balance), and would be payable on demand upon presentation to either the Issuing Bank or the relevant Confirming Bank.
It is also proposed that the Company enter into a side letter to the Yantai

<<<

 Asset Purchase Agreement with Yantai and Remedial Cyprus (the "Side Letter"). The Side Letter would provide for mutual waivers and releases between the Company and Yantai from any obligations or liabilities either party may have to the other

<<<

 under the terms of the Yantai Construction Contract, including a discharge of the Company's obligation to pay the final instalment due to Yantai under the Yantai Construction Contract, with such monies instead being retained by the Company

<<<

 with the intention that they would ultimately be made available as a distribution to the Company's stakeholders.
On the basis of the Purchase Price to be paid by Yantai, and the release of the Company's obligations under the Yantai Construction

<<<

 Contract, it is anticipated that the proposed transactions contemplated in relation to the disposal of the Yantai Assets will have a value of approximately US$90 million for the Company.
If the Bondholders approve the disposal of the Yantai

<<<

 Assets, it is anticipated that the Company and Remedial Cyprus will effect the Subsequent Completion pursuant to the terms of the Remedial Cyprus Asset Purchase Agreement, with the completion of the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement and the disposal

<<<

 of the Yantai Assets by the Company to Yantai taking place immediately thereafter.
However, as noted above, the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement is capable of termination by either the Company or Yantai if, within 15 business days of the date

<<<

 of execution of the

3

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA www.tmslfc.iio
Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement, the disposal of the Yantai Assets has not been approved by the Bondholders. Accordingly, if the Bondholders do not approve the disposal

<<<

 of the Yantai Assets within such time period, and irrespective of Yantai's right to terminate the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement, the directors of the Company will need to exercise their right to terminate the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement

<<<

 in order to avoid the Company acting in breach of the terms of the Loan Agreement.
If the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement is terminated for the reasons contemplated above, then the Company will need to revert to working with Remedial Cyprus

<<<

 in order to explore possible solutions with respect to the purported termination of the Yantai Construction Contract by Yantai. Whilst the Company has no definitive current plans as to how a solution to this issue may be achieved, Bondholders

<<<

 should be aware that any solutions contemplated by the Company may have an uncertain outcome and may lead to additional expenses being incurred by the Company.
4. RESOLUTIONS
The Company therefore proposes that the Bondholders consent to the

<<<

 sale of the Yantai Assets on the terms contemplated by the Yantai Asset Purchase Agreement, the Corporate Guarantee, the Standby Letter of Credit and the Side Letter.
5. EVALUATION
Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders

<<<

 by any of the Loan Trustee, Bingham or AMA. Bondholders should independently evaluate the proposals and vote accordingly.
