ANNEMORA
MINERAL AB
Background for the Proposal to Bondholders

<<<


Commercial production of iron ore products at the Dannemora mine began in April 2012. Supply agreements have been signed with Northern European steel producers, and logistics have run smoothly. To date, 23 shipments by sea have been delivered

<<<

 to end customers. However, production of iron ore products in 2012 was lower than planned, amounting to 270 kt, rather than the planned 400 kt. The low er production and an unfavorable dollar rate resulted in an unplanned liquidity decline

<<<

 o f approx. SEK 100 million.
The lower production was largely due to a lower than expected yield at the sorting plant. An action programme aimed at gradually increasing the yield is in progress. The action programme is expected to involve investments

<<<

 of SEK 30 million in 2013 and SEK 80 million in 2014.
On the basis of the above factors, the Board of Dannemora has decided, subject to approval by an extraordinary general m eeting (scheduled for 13 M arch 2013), to conduct a fully guaranteed

<<<

 rights issue of up to approx. SEK 211 million before issue costs (the "Rights I s s u e " ).
Due to the lower production levels experienced, the Company will not be able to be in compliance with its N et Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA Ratio

<<<

 by year end 2013 (when it comes into effect according to the Bond Agreement). In addition the Company will be tem porarily below its M inim um liquidity threshold after the interest paym ent due M arch 22nd.
The Company will therefore ask the

<<<

 Bondholders to amend the date where the Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA Ratio comes into effect by 1 year (to commence from year end 2014), of which the Company believe it will be in a position to comply with the set threshold based on the

<<<

 expected production and EBITDA increase during 2014. In addition the Company will ask the Bondholders for a temporary short term waiver of the Minimum liquidity covenant, until the net proceeds from the Rights Issue will be in the Com pany

<<<

's accounts.
As it is difficult to attract new equity capital based on the anticipated near term covenant breach, the abovementioned waiver and amendment is a condition for the Rights Issue.
