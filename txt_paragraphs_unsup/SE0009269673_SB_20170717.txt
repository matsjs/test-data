1. Background
1.1 The Issuer has, under Clause 13.3 (Merger) of the Terms and Conditions, undertaken to procure

<<<

 that the Permitted Merger is completed within nine (9) months from the First Issue Date. The purpose of Clause 13.3 (Merger) of the Terms and Conditions is to simplify the structure of the Group and to collapse certain members of the Group

<<<

. However, after the date of the Terms and Conditions it has been brought to the Issuer's attention that certain members of the Group have tax losses carry forward from the financial year 2016. The tax losses affects the ability to complete

<<<

 the Permitted Merger without adverse tax consequences. The Groups Financial adviser KPMG has, on behalf of the Group, provided a structure memo dated 10 April 2017 as set out in Schedule 1 (the "Structure Memo") with a proposal of a restructuring

<<<

 of the Group which will facilitate for the Group to keep the benefit of tax losses carried forward. Attention must be drawn to the fact that the Structure Memo is prepared for another purpose and is solely shared on a non-reliance basis for

<<<

 any other parties, including any creditors, bondholders etc. For further information see "Private and Confidential" in the presentation.
1.2 The restructuring as set out in the Structure Memo (the "Restructuring") includes, amongst others,

<<<

 that:
(a) the shares in Jetpak Group AB will be sold by Jetpak Holding AB to the Issuer (subject to the share pledge granted over such shares under the share pledge agreement dated 2 December 2016 with Jetpak Holding AB as pledgor and Nordic

<<<

 Trustee & Agency AB (publ) as Security Agent);
(b) the shares in Jetpak Intressenter AB owned by P-JP 2005 AB will be sold and distributed in kind by P-JP 2005 AB to the Issuer (subject to the share pledge granted over such shares under the

<<<

 share pledge agreement dated 2 December 2016 with P-JP 2005 AB as pledgor and Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) as Security Agent);
(c) the shares in Jetpak Group Holding AB will be sold and distributed in kind by PJetpak 2012 AB to the Issuer

<<<

 (subject to the share pledge granted over such shares under the share pledge agreement dated 2 December 2016 with P-Jetpak 2012 AB as pledgor and Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) as Security Agent);
(d) the shares in Jetpak Intressenter AB

<<<

 owned by Jetpak Group Holding AB will be sold and distributed in kind by Jetpak Group Holding AB to the Issuer (subject to the share pledge granted over such shares under the share pledge agreement dated 2 December 2016 with Jetpak Group Holding

<<<

 AB as pledgor and Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) as Security Agent);
(e) the shares in Jetpak Group Holding AB will be sold by the Issuer to P-Jetpak 2012 AB (subject to the share pledge granted over such shares under the share pledge
2

<<<

 (7)

agreement dated 2 December 2016 with P-Jetpak 2012 AB as pledgor and Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) as Security Agent);
(f) the actions listed in paragraphs (i) to (v) (inclusive) above, shall be referred to as the "Disposals". The

<<<

 Disposals, pursuant to Clause 13.7 (Disposal o fAssets) of the Terms and Conditions, are not permitted as the shares in certain Guarantors are disposed of. The Disposals are however necessary to consummate the Restructuring Mergers and will

<<<

 be executed subject to the transaction security in place today;
(g) the Issuer's existing receivable in the amount of SEK 42,637,009.09 towards Jetpak Group Holding AB (the "Intra-Group Loan"), which is pledged under the loan pledge agreement

<<<

 dated 2 December 2016 with the Issuer as pledgor and Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) as Security Agent) is partly set off against Jetpak Group Holding AB's SEK 51,000,000 receivable towards the Issuer related to the purchase of Jetpak Intressenter

<<<

 AB (the "Set Off"). The Set Off is not in compliance with the terms of the pledge agreement over the Intra-Group Loan as the pledge agreement restricts set offs. However it was initially contemplated that the pledge over the Intra-Group Loan

<<<

 would cease to exist following the Permitted Merger as set out in Clause 13.3 (Merger) of the Terms and Conditions;
(h) following the Disposals and the Set Off, Jetpak Intressenter AB, Jetpak Holding AB and P-JP 2005 AB will merge into the

<<<

 Issuer with the Issuer as the surviving entity and Jetpak Group Holding AB will merge into P-Jetpak 2012 AB with PJetpak 2012 AB as the surviving entity (the "Restructuring Mergers").
1.3 Further, the Issuer will not be able to complete the

<<<

 Restructuring before the due date stipulated by Clause 13.3 of the Terms and Conditions (being nine (9) months from the First Issue Date).
1.4 The difference in outcome between the restructuring plan as set out in Clause 13.3 (Merger) of the

<<<

 Terms and Conditions and the Restructuring set out in this document and the Structure Memo is that (i) P-Jetpak 2012 AB will not be merged and will remain a member of the Group and remain pledged to the bondholders and (ii) the Restructuring

<<<

 will not be completed before the due date stipulated by Clause 13.3 of the Terms and Conditions.

 to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).

 the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned
