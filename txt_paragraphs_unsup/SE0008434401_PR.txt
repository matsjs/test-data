Risk factors

Risk factors

An investment in corporate bonds always involves a certain degree of risk. A number of factors affect and may come to affect the result and financial position of AB Sagax (publ) ("Sagax" or the "Company") and the value
of the

<<<

 EUR senior unsecured floating rate notes (the "Notes"). Below is a description of risk factors, which Sagax considers to be the most relevant to an assessment by a prospective investor of whether to invest in the Notes. However, potential investors

<<<

 should note that the below risk factors are neither exhaustive nor ranked in order of importance. The intention is to describe risks that are linked to Sagax's operations and its ability to fulfill its obligations in accordance with the terms

<<<

 and conditions of the Notes dated 15 June 2016 (the "Terms
and Conditions") and to describe the risks related to the investments in the Notes. Before making a decision to invest in the Notes, any potential investor should carefully consider

<<<

 the risk factors
outlined below, as well as any other information provided (such as the final Terms and Conditions and any public available financial and other information of Sagax). In addition, an investor must, alone or together with its

<<<

 financial and any other adviser it deems appropriate, engage in an analysis of the global market conditions and general information about the relevant real property markets and real property companies from its own perspective. An investor should

<<<

 have adequate knowledge to evaluate the risk factors as well as sufficient
financial strength to assume these risks. The risk factors below are not exhaustive and additional risk factors presently not known to the Company may affect the Company

<<<

's future ability to pay interest, principal or make any
other payments in respect of the Notes.

RISKS RELATED TO SAGAX Rental income and development Sagax's revenue is affected by the long-term demand for warehouses and industrial premises

<<<

, the properties' tenancy ratio and the rent levels. The rent level risk is related to the development of current market rents. The average term of Sagax's lease agreements is long, but, Sagax could be adversely affected by a long-term negative

<<<

 development of the relevant market rents.
Credit risk Sagax's main credit risk is the tenants being unable to fulfill their obligation to pay rent under the lease agreements, which could adversely affect Sagax's liquidity and result.
Operational

<<<

 and maintenance costs Tenants leasing warehouses and light industrial premises usually have a relatively extensive liability for operations and maintenance. The most important operational costs are electricity and heating costs of the properties

<<<

. The tenants are charged directly or on-charged by Sagax for the majority of such costs. In the event of vacancies, Sagax's result is not only affected by the loss of lease revenue but also by costs for, for example, electricity and heating

<<<

, which would otherwise be paid for by tenants.

entails risks such as future loss of tenants, environmental conditions and technical deficiencies, such as design defects, other hidden deficiencies, damages and pollution. When acquiring property

<<<

 companies, risks for taxes and legal disputes are added. Such risks can, if realised, adversely affect Sagax's operations, result and financial position.
Fluctuations in property value Sagax is exposed to changes of the Group's property portfolio

<<<

's market value. Sagax reports the Group's properties at their fair value pursuant to the Swedish accounting standard IAS 40 Förvaltningsfastigheter, which means that the consolidated booked value of the properties, corresponds to their aggregated

<<<

 estimated market value. This means that a decrease in the market value of the properties will adversely affect Sagax's balance sheet and income statements. In order to prepare the accounts pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles

<<<

 in Sweden, the management of Sagax must make assessments and assumptions that affect the value of the assets and liabilities and income and costs, as well as other information in the financial reports. The actual outcome can deviate from such

<<<

 assessments and assumptions. The valuation of investment properties is heavily affected by assessments and assumptions made by the management.

Risks related to transactions Acquisitions of additional properties are a part of Sagax's ordinary

<<<

 business and such acquisitions inherently involve a degree of risk and uncertainty. A property acquisition

Holding company The Company is a holding company and the Group's operations are mainly run through its subsidiaries. The Company is

<<<

 hence dependent on its subsidiaries to fulfill its

2

PROSPECTUS FOR ADMISSION TO TRADING

Risk factors

obligations under the Notes. The Group intends to provide the Company with liquidity by way of intra-group loans, dividends or other

<<<

 transfers of value in order for the Company to fulfill its obligations under the Notes. However, if the subsidiaries do not provide liquidity, or due to other circumstances, conditions, laws or regulations are prevented from providing liquidity

<<<

 to the Company, there is a risk that the Company will not fulfill its obligations under the Notes.
Financing Sagax is financed through equity and interest-bearing debt. Most of the interest-bearing debt is borrowed by the Company's property

<<<

 owning subsidiaries, which means that the financial risks in Sagax are primarily attributable to its subsidiaries. The Group's long-term financing consists of bilateral and syndicated credit facilities and listed bond loans. The listed bond

<<<

 loans amount to SEK 2,581,000,000 as per 22 june 2016. Swedish and foreign commercial banks are the main counterparties in the first mentioned credit facilities. In some cases there are certain obligations under the credit facilities on maintaining

<<<

, for example, certain interest cover ratios and certain loan to value ratios. This means that the lenders could be entitled to demand repayment in advance if the relevant Group Companies do not fulfill such obligations. If such demand is made

<<<

 it could adversely affect Sagax's financial position.
In addition to the Group's long-term debt Sagax has two commercial paper programmes in the aggregate amount of SEK 1,500,000,000 and EUR 200,000,000 respectively. SEK 798,000,000 was issued

<<<

 as per 31 March 2016. Sagax has back-up facilities in the aggregate amount of SEK 798,000,000 to bridge repayments under the commercial paper program if necessary.
Sagax and its subsidiaries are dependent on their ability to refinance existing

<<<

 financings as these fall due and to obtain additional financing at market terms in connection with for example property acquisitions. In case Sagax and its subsidiaries are unable to refinance existing financings or obtain additional financing

<<<

 at market terms, as a result of a deficiency in the capital market or for any other reason, this could adversely affect Sagax's operations, result and financial position.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk of not having access

<<<

 to sufficient liquidity or credit commitments to cover its payment obligations, including payments of interest. A lack of liquidity to cover payments due could adversely affect Sagax's business and financial position. Sagax's working capital

<<<

 was SEK 46,000,000 as of March 31, 2016. Sagax's available capital was SEK 1,341,000,000 of which SEK 287,000,000 came from bank loans and SEK 1,054,000,000 came from unutilised credit commitments. The utilisation of these credit commitments

<<<

 are not conditioned on Sagax providing any additional security.
 Interest rate risk Sagax's main current cost item is interest costs. Interest rate risk is defined as the risk of an effect on the financing cost of Sagax due to changes in the

<<<

 market interest

rate. The interest rate risk is related to the development of current interest rates. As of March 31, 2016, the interestbearing debt totaled SEK 10,682,000,000. A negative development, from Sagax's perspective, of interest

<<<

 rates would adversely affect Sagax's result and financial position.
Financial derivatives' change of value Sagax uses financial instruments such as interest rate derivatives, mostly nominal interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks

<<<

 related to its high share of loans with short-term interest periods. The interest rate derivatives are currently reported at their fair value in the balance sheet. Change of value is reported in Sagax's income statement. In line with changes

<<<

 in the market interest rates, either a surplus value or a negative value will arise in such interest rate derivatives. Sagax purpose with using the interest rate derivatives is to increase the predictability of its profit from property management

<<<

 and to decrease its financial risk. Decreasing market interest rates will result in decreased market value of Sagax's interest rate derivatives, which could adversely affect the result and financial position of Sagax. The graph below shows

<<<

 the revaluation in the event of changes in swap curves as per 31 December 2015.

Currency risk As of March 31, 2016 the Group owned 85 properties in Finland, five properties in Germany and four properties in France, which results in an

<<<

 exposure to the euro currency. The properties are financed by equity and/or bank loans. The bank loans for the Finnish and German properties are denominated in euro. The interest-bearing debt in euro was equal to SEK 4,039,000,000 as of March

<<<

 31, 2016. At the same time, the market value of the properties in Finland, Germany and France was equal to SEK 6,713,300. The net exposure as of March 31, 2016, assets minus debts in euro, totaled SEK 2,244,000,000. Sagax's accounting pursuant

<<<

 to IAS 21 results in the majority of exchange rate effects being reported directly against the equity. Only a minor part of the exchange rate effects is reported in the income statement.
The Group also owns two properties in Denmark. Both properties

<<<

 in Denmark were mortgaged as of March 31, 2016 in DKK. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect Sagax's result and financial position.

Risk factors

Organisational risks Sagax has a relatively

<<<

 small organisation, which leads to a dependence on key persons. Sagax's future development is to a large extent dependent on the experience, knowledge and commitment of management and other key personnel. Sagax operations and results could

<<<

 be adversely affected should one or several of such key persons terminate their employment.
Operational risks Operational risk describes the risk of incurring losses in the continued operations due to insufficient routines. This among other

<<<

 things could be the lack of internal control, appropriate administrative systems and competence development. If the routines proves to be inadequate there is a risk that Sagax incurs losses which could have an effect on Sagax's operations,

<<<

 earnings and financial position.
Environmental risk Pursuant to current environmental law the liability for pollution and other environmental damages is, as a general rule, on the current and previous operator of a property. Sagax does not

<<<

 run any business that requires permission under the Swedish Environmental Code (Miljöbalken (1998:808)). However, there might be tenants, who are deemed to be operators under the Swedish Environmental Code, whose operations require permission

<<<

 under the Swedish Environmental Code. If no operator is able to carry out or pay for the after-treatment of a property, the person who acquired the property after 1 January 2000 and at the time of the acquisition was aware of the pollution

<<<

, or ought to have detected it in connection with the acquisition, is liable for the after-treatment. This means that claims for decontamination or after-treatment of any actual or suspected pollution in land, water area or groundwater in certain

<<<

 circumstances may be directed against members of the Group in order to ensure that the property is in such condition as is required by the Swedish Environmental Code. Such claim could adversely affect Sagax's result and financial position.

<<<


Taxes and changes in legislation Changes in legislation related to corporate income tax, property tax and other taxes, for example changes in the possibility for depreciation for tax purposes and tax deductions on interest costs could adversely

<<<

 affect Sagax's result. Sagax has accumulated tax losses. The Group's loss carry-forward as of December 31, 2015 totals to a net amount of SEK 1,516,000,000. Changes to the ownership of the Company resulting in a change of control of the Company

<<<

 can lead to limitations (in whole or in part) of the possibility to use such carry-forwards. Changes in legislation or case law can affect the possibility to use such carry-forwards. Sagax pays property tax for all properties except five, and

<<<

 has in most lease agreements agreed upon this cost being covered by the tenants. Further, a change in legislation or case law, for example within the lease, acquisition or environmental legislation, could adversely affect Sagax's result and

<<<

 financial position.
Other disputes Sagax could become involved in future disputes. The results of any pending or future investigation, proceeding, litigation or arbitration brought by private parties, regulatory authorities or governments could

<<<

 affect Sagax

operations. In addition, if an unfavourable decision were to be given against Sagax, significant fines, damages and/or negative publicity could adversely affect Sagax's result and financial position.
Geographical risk The supply

<<<

 and demand for properties and the return on property investments varies between different geographical markets and may develop differently within different geographical markets. Sagax has a diversified property portfolio, with its properties

<<<

 located in different geographical markets. However, the demand for premises to lease could decline in one or all of such markets, which could adversely affect Sagax's operations, result and financial position.
Competition Sagax operates in

<<<

 a competitive sector. Sagax's future competitive potential is dependent on, amongst other things, Sagax's ability to predict future changes and its ability to quickly respond to present and future market needs. Sagax competes against a number

<<<

 of strong companies, which could gain market shares at the expense of Sagax. Consequently, it may become necessary for Sagax to make costly investments, restructurings or price reductions in order to adapt to a new competitive situation, which

<<<

 could adversely affect Sagax's operations, result and financial position.
RISKS RELATED TO THE NOTES Bond loans can contain elements resulting in particular risks for potential investors. The interest rate for the Notes is relatively high,

<<<

 which should compensate the higher risk of a Holder, compared to an investment in, for example, government bonds having a lower interest rate.
Credit risk If Sagax's financial position deteriorates it is likely that the credit risk associated

<<<

 with the Notes will increase since the risk that Sagax cannot fulfill its obligations under the Notes increases. Sagax's financial position is affected by numerous risk factors, some of which have been outlined above. An increased credit risk

<<<

 could result in the market pricing the Notes with a higher risk premium, which would adversely affect the value of the Notes. Another aspect of the credit risk is that a deteriorated financial position could result in a lower credit-worthiness

<<<

, which could affect Sagax's ability of refinancing when the Notes mature.
Interest rate risk The value of the Notes is dependent on several factors, one of the most significant over time being the level of the general market interest rates

<<<

. The Notes have a floating rate structure based on 6 months EURIBOR and the interest rate of the Notes will be determined two business days prior to the first day of each Interest Period. Hence, the interest rate is to a certain extent adjusted

<<<

 for changes in the level of the general interest rate. An increase of the general interest rate level could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The general interest rate level is to a high degree affected by the European and the international

<<<

 financial development and is outside the Company's control.

Risk factors

Holders' meeting The Terms and Conditions include certain provisions regarding Holders' meetings, which may be held in order

<<<

 to resolve on matters relating to the Holders' interests. Such provisions allow for designated majorities to bind all Holders, including Holders who have not participated in or voted at the actual meeting or who have voted differently than

<<<

 the required majority, to decisions that have been taken at a duly convened and conducted Holders' meeting. Consequently, there is a risk that the actions of the majority in such matters could impact a Holder's right in a manner that would

<<<

 be undesirable for some of the Holders.
Holders' representation In accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Agent represents all Holders in all matters relating to the Notes. However, in certain situations, Holders could bring their own

<<<

 action against Sagax, which could negatively impact an acceleration of the Notes or other action against Sagax. To enable the Agent to represent the Holders in court, the Holders may have to submit a written power of attorney for legal proceedings

<<<

. The failure of all Holders to submit such a power of attorney could negatively impact the enforcement of the Notes and the possibility for the Holders to exercise their rights under the Notes. Under the Terms and Conditions the Agent has the

<<<

 right in some cases to make decisions and take measures that bind all Holders. Consequently, the actions of the Agent in such matters could impact a Holder's rights under the Terms and Conditions in a manner that would be undesirable for some

<<<

 of the Holders.
Liquidity risk Sagax will apply for registration of the Notes on the List of Corporate Bonds of the Regulated Market of Nasdaq Stockholm after the prospectus for the Notes has been approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory

<<<

 Author ity (Finansinspektionen). However, there is a risk that the Notes will not be admitted to trading. Even if the Notes are admitted to trading, there is not always active trading in the bonds. This can result in Holders not being able

<<<

 to sell their Notes when they wish to or at a yield comparable to similar investments having an existing and functioning secondary market. A lack of liquidity in the market could have an adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.
Currency

<<<

 risk The Notes will be denominated and payable in EUR. If investors in the Notes measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than EUR, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among

<<<

 other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the EUR relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which Sagax has no control

<<<

. There is a risk that depreciation of the EUR against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could

<<<

 result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return

on their investments. Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the

<<<

 past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Company to make payments in respect of the Notes. As a result, there is a risk that investors may receive less interest or principal than

<<<

 expected, or no interest or principal.
Clearing and settlement in Euroclear Sweden's account-based system The Notes will be affiliated to and will continue to be affiliated to Euroclear Sweden's account-based system. Consequently, no physical

<<<

 notes have been or will be issued. Clearing and settlement relating to the Notes, as well as payment of interest and redemption of principal amounts, will be performed within the account-based system. The Holders are therefore dependent on

<<<

 the functionality of the account-based system.
Preferential right Sagax intends to find financing which is, in Sagax's opinion, suitable and beneficial for the Group. This means that bank loans could be raised and securities issued which are

<<<

 secured by mortgages over properties, normally constituting a claim on Sagax with preferential rights. The Notes represent an unsecured obligation of Sagax. This means that in the event of Sagax's liquidation, company reorganisation or bankruptcy

<<<

, Holders will receive payment only after any creditor with a claim with preferential right, normally with security over certain assets, have been paid in full. Every potential investor should be aware that by purchasing Notes, it risks losing

<<<

 the entire or parts of its investment in the event of Sagax's liquidation, company reorganisation or bankruptcy.
There is no restriction under the Terms and Conditions for the subsidiaries of Sagax to incur debt. If the subsidiaries incur debt

<<<

, the right to payment under the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the right of payment relating to debt incurred by subsidiaries of Sagax.
Changes in legislation The Terms and Conditions are based on Swedish legislation applicable

<<<

 at the date hereof. The impact of potential future change in legislation may result in risks which are not possible to forsee. Changes in legislation, case law or administrative practice may have a negative effect on the value of the Notes

<<<

.
Prepayment risk Sagax has a right under the Terms and Conditions to redeem all outstanding Notes in advance. If so, a certain additional sum shall be paid. There is a risk that the market value of the Notes is higher than the price that Sagax

<<<

 may be entitled to redeem the Notes for. However, an early redemption can never be made at an amount lower than a nominal amount of 100 per cent.

GENERAL CORPORATE AND GROUP INFORMATION The Issuer's legal and commercial

<<<

 name is AB Sagax (publ) and its corp. reg. no is 556520-0028. The Issuer was incorporated in Sweden and registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) on 14 July 1995. The Issuer is a public limited liability company

<<<

 (Sw. publikt aktiebolag) subject to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)). The seat of the Board of Directors is in Stockholm.
Pursuant to the Issuer's Articles of Association (§3), adopted at the Extra General Meeting

<<<

 on 19 March 2013, the object of the Issuer's business shall be to, directly or through subsidiaries, own and manage and trade with real property, and other business incidental thereto.
The registered office is at Engelbrektsplan 1, 114 34 Stockholm

<<<

, Sweden. The telephone number of the Issuer is +46 (0)8 545 83 540.
BUSINESS CONCEPT AB Sagax is a property company whose business concept is to invest in commercial properties, primarily in the warehouse and light industry segment.
COMPANY

<<<

 GOALS The overriding goal is the long-term generation of the maximum risk-adjusted return to the company's owners. To reach this goal, Sagax has set the following business targets:  Operations must generate a long-term sustainable return
and

<<<

 strengthen cash flow.  T he company intends to continue to grow through
property acquisitions after taking into account the riskadjusted return.  M easured in real terms, the company is to create cashflow growth from the existing property portfolio

<<<

.
STRATEGIES Management strategy Sagax pursues efficiency and a long-term approach in its management strategy. The management strategy includes actively pursuing long leases. This applies equally to new leases and to the management of existing

<<<

 leases. The focus is to abstain from attempting to maximize rent levels in any given moment in favor of reaching lease agreements of a longer duration with solvent tenants.
The average lease term for the portfolio as a whole was 7.6 years at

<<<

 March 31, 2016, compared to 8.1 years at March 31, 2015.
Investment strategy Sagax invests primarily in warehouse and industrial properties. The objective is to carry out additional acquisitions

and complementary investments in existing properties

<<<

. Property acquisitions and investments in the existing portfolio aim to increase cash flow and diversify rental revenue and thereby to reduce the operational and financial risk.
Funding strategy The funding structure of Sagax has a focus on

<<<

 operating cash flow and the interest coverage ratio. This is expected to create prerequisites for expansion and an attractive return on shareholders' capital.
Sagax has a conservative approach to risk. Accordingly, Sagax pursues long-term fixed

<<<

 interest and maturity structures to secure operating cash flow. The average fixedinterest period of the Group was 2.9 years at March 31, 2016 compared to 2.8 years at March 31, 2015. The long fixed-interest period reduces interest sensitivity

<<<

 but normally results in a higher average interest rate than a shorter fixed-interest period. The average maturity structure was 3.9 years at March 31, 2016 compared to 3.0 years at March 31, 2015.
Dividend strategy Sagax`s dividend strategy

<<<

 is to distribute about one third of the annual profit from property management in total dividend payments on common and preference shares. In addition, the Board can propose the distribution of nonrecurring profits to shareholders.
FINANCIAL

<<<

 TARGETS  Return on equity, measured over a five-year period, must
amount to not less than 15% per year.  Profit from property management per common share
must increase by a minimum of 15% per year. T he long-term target for the interest-coverage

<<<

 ratio is a
minimum of 150%. T he long-term target for the debt ratio is less than 70%.
PROPERTY PORTFOLIO At March 31, 2016, the property portfolio comprised of 225 properties with a lettable area of 1,874,000 square meters. The average remaining

<<<

 lease term was 7.6 years compared to 8.1 years the same period the previous year. The focus of the portfolio is on the Stockholm and Helsinki region where 63 per cent of the market value and 63 per cent of the rental value is concentrated.

<<<

 The total rental value and annual contractual rent amounted to SEK 1,470 million and SEK 1,411 million, respectively, at March 31, 2016. This corresponds to an economic leasing rate of 96 per cent. The tables and graphs below is a summary of

<<<

 the property portfolio as of March 31, 2016.

tered that capital and interest shall be deposited in

a certain bank account, deposits of principal and

<<<



interest will be effected by the CSD on the rele-

vant Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date (as

applicable). In other cases, payments of principal

and interest will be transferred by the CSD to the

Holder at the address registered

<<<

 with the CSD on

the Record Date. Should the CSD, due to a delay

on behalf of the Company or some other obstacle,

not be able to effect the payment of the relevant

amount, the CSD will pay such amount to the

Holders on the Record Date as

<<<

 soon as possible af-

ter such obstacle has been removed. If a person to

whom payment has been made in accordance with

the above was not entitled to receive such payment,

the Company and the CSD shall nevertheless be

deemed to have fulfilled

<<<

 their obligations, provided

that the CSD did not have knowledge that such

payment was made to a person who was not enti-

tled to receive such amount and provided that the

CSD has acted with normal care.

EURIBOR plus two (2) percentage units, from (but

excluding) the relevant due date up to (and including)


<<<


the date of actual payment. EURIBOR shall be deter-

mined for each weekly period of delay. Default interest shall, however, subject to Condition 8.2, never be less than the Interest Rate plus two (2) percentage units. Accrued default interest

<<<

pressed in these Terms and Conditions and the Hold-

ers potential to start actions on behalf of the Holders

<<<

 Days after the Agent has notified the Holders that it will cease to perform its obligations by reason of the non-payment of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Terms and Conditions or the Agency Agreement or by any reason described

<<<

, counsels and assistants. The meeting can decide that further individuals may attend. The meeting is opened by a present person appointed by the Company (or, if such person does not exist, a present person appointed by the Agent) and the meeting

<<<

 represented at the meeting or if they have participated in the procedure in writing and irrespective of how and if the they have voted.

<<<

 financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances. 13.3.5The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance
