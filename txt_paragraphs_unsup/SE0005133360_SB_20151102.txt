REQUEST FOR WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS OF THE TERMS AND

<<<



CONDITIONS

The Company hereby requests that the Holders approve the proposed amendment to the Terms and Conditions as described in Item 3 (the "Request") below.

2.2

Validity, effectiveness and conditionality

The Holders

<<<

' approval of the Request and consequently the amended Terms and Conditions shall become valid immediately upon the Holders consent.

2.3

Non-Reliance

The Request is presented to the Holders without evaluation or recommendations from the Agent

<<<

THE REQUEST

In order to obtain a flexible financing structure, the Company requests the Holders to approve the amendments to the Terms and Conditions set out below

<<<

 in A and in B. In the below, blue and underlined text indicates additions whereas red and crossed-out text indicates removals.

(A) Definitions:

"Early Redemption Amount" means:

(a) the Make Whole Amount if the Early Redemption Date occurs

<<<

 before 9 May 2016;
(b) 104.00 percent of the Nominal Amount if the Early Redemption Date occurs during the period 9 May 2016 - 8 May 2017; and
(c) 102.00 percent of the Nominal Amount if the Early Redemption Date occurs during the period 9

<<<

 May 2017 - 7 May 2018;

"Early Redemption Date" means any Banking Day after 8 May 2016, but before the Final Redemption Date;

"Make Whole Amount" means an amount equal to the sum of:

(a) the present value on the relevant Record Date of 1

<<<

04.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount as if such payment originally should have taken place on 9 May 2016; and

(b) the present value on the relevant Record Date of the remaining interest payments (excluding accrued but unpaid interest up to

<<<

 the relevant redemption date) up to and including 9 May 2016;

both calculated by using a discount rate of fifty (50) basis points over the comparable Swedish Government Bond Rate (i.e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Bonds until

<<<

 the 9 May 2016).

"Swedish Government Bond Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations of Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office (a Swedish Government Bond; Sw. statsobligation) with a

<<<

 constant maturity (such yield to be the weekly average yield as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that has become publicly available at least two (2) Banking Days (but not more than five (5) Banking Days

<<<

) prior to the relevant redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Company in good faith)) most nearly equal to the period from the

<<<

 relevant redemption date to the 9 May 2016; provided, however, that if the period from the relevant redemption date to the 9 May 2016 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of Sweden, acting through the Swedish National

<<<

 Debt Office for which a weekly average yield is given, the Swedish Government Bond Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of Sweden

<<<

, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office, for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to the 9 May 2016 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of

<<<

 Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

(B) Clause 9 Early redemption by request of the Company:

9.1

The Company may redeem all, but not only some, of the Bonds

<<<

 early on any Early Redemption Date. The Company can exercise its option by giving the Holders not less than 10 calendar 30 calendar days' notice in accordance with Section 26. The notice shall be irrevocable and state the redemption date and

<<<

 the relevant Record Date.

4.1

Final date to participate in the procedure in writing

The Agent must have received the votes by mail

<<<

, courier or email to the address indicated below no later than at 17:00 (CET) on 16 November 2015. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.

4.2

Decision procedure

The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate

<<<

 under the procedure in writing as valid votes. When a requisite majority of consents of the total Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent, the Request shall be deemed to be approved by the Holders, even if the time period for replies

<<<

 in the procedure in writing has not yet expired. Information about the decision taken under the procedure in writing

will be sent by notice to the Holders and be published on the websites of the Company and the Agent. A matter decided under

<<<

 the procedure in writing will be binding for all Holders, irrespective of them responding to or voting against the Request (provided that the Request is approved by the required majority of the total Nominal Amount).

4.3

Voting right and

<<<

 authorisation

Anyone who wishes to participate in the procedure in writing must on the Record Date 9 November 2015 in the debt register:

(a) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities Account; or (b) be registered as authorised

<<<

 nominee in a Securities Account;

with respect to one or several Bonds.

4.4

Bonds registered with a nominee

If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another

<<<

 intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.

1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can

<<<

 obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule B) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form (Schedule A) based on the authorisation. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation

<<<

 directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as bondholder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as

<<<

 a Holder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.

Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds

<<<

 the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).

The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in

<<<

 the procedure in writing and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate.

<<<

<<<

<<<
