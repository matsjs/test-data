 and Production Ghana AS. In addition the Secured USD Bond is secured by a share pledge over all the shares issued by the same mentioned guarantors.

Under the Loan Agreement of the Secured USD Bond, the Borrower had an obligation to pay an

<<<

 installment of USD 10 000 000 which was due on 4 May 2009. The Borrower failed to meet this payment obligation. Subsequently the entire Secured USD Bond was declared in default, and due for immediate payment. However, the Borrower had for some

<<<

 time a standstill agreement with major Bondholders of the Secured USD Bond, allowing the Borrower some time to remedy the situation. Despite extensions in the original timeline of the standstill agreement, the Borrower has not managed to remedy

<<<

 the situation. The standstill agreement has now been cancelled.

The Bondholders of the Secured USD Bond have instructed the Loan Trustee to initiate filing of petitions for enforcement of the loan security.
