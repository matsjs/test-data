 Bond Issue 2014/2016

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Oslo, 16 June 2016

1. INTRODUCTION
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond

<<<

 Issue" or the "Bonds") in respect of which Xcite Energy Resources pic (formerly Xcite Energy Resources Limited) (the "Issuer")) is the issuer and Xcite Energy Limited (the "Parent") is the guarantor.
All capitalised terms used in this summons

<<<

 (the "Summons") shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 27 June 2014 (as amended and/or restated from time to time) and made between the Issuer, the Parent and the Bond Trustee (the "Bond Agreement") unless otherwise

<<<

 stated herein.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Background to the Proposal
The Issuer has been in discussions for some time with an `ad hoc' committee of Bondholders holding in excess of 93% of the Bonds with respect to a potential restructuring of the Bonds

<<<

. While those negotiations have been constructive, no terms have yet been agreed. The Issuer would like to request a short-term extension to the Maturity Date of the Bonds, which is currently 30 June 2016, to 30 September 2016 to afford it time

<<<

 to continue those negotiations and lo allow it to resolve terms for restructuring the Bonds.
In light of the above negotiations, the Issuer is also agreeing to amendments to the Bond Agreement such that an Event of Default would occur under

<<<

 Clause 15.1 of the Bond Agreement in the event that (i) the constitutional documents of the Issuer or the Parent were to be amended (save for amendments approved by a Bondholders' Meeting or by Written Resolution (as defined in paragraph 1

<<<

 of Schedule 1 and the proposal for its insertion into the Bond Agreement as detailed below); (ii) the shareholder rights plan agreement dated 30 November 2010 between the Parent and Computershare Investor Services Inc. (as amended prior to

<<<

 the date of this Summons) were to be amended, extended or replaced with any similar or analogous agreement; or (iii) any options, warrants or other rights to purchase, subscribe for or acquire any of the shares in the Issuer or the Parent were

<<<

 to be granted to any person other than for cash at or in excess of fair market value.
The Issuer is further agreeing to an amendment to the minimum cash balance undertaking in Clause 13.6.1 of the Bond Agreement such that the Issuer and the

<<<

 Parent must ensure that the balance on the Group balance sheet at the end of each calendar month during the period of the Maturity Date Extension (as defined below) is equal to or higher than the relevant balance listed in the table at

PO

<<<

 Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 for the relevant month end date (rather than at least USD 6 million throughout the term of the Bond Issue). All professional adviser fees invoiced

<<<

 to and paid by the Issuer or the Parent on or after 1 June 2016 in relation to a potential restructuring of the Bonds will be added back to the balance on the Group balance sheet at the end of each calendar month for the purpose of the minimum

<<<

 balance undertaking in Clause 13.6.1 of the Bond Agreement. The Issuer will also provide the Bond Trustee on a fortnightly basis with a schedule detailing all professional adviser fees in relation to a potential restructuring of the Bonds which

<<<

 have been accrued and/or paid by each of the Issuer and the Parent up to and including the date of such schedule.
Finally, the Issuer is requesting amendments to the Bond Agreement to (i) reduce the notice period for a Bondholders' Meeting

<<<

; and (ii) allow a written resolution procedure to be used in lieu of a Bondholders' Meeting, to simplify and speed up the voting process for Bondholders when the terms of a restructuring are agreed and are presented to the Bondholders.
2.2

<<<

 Payment of interest The Issuer agrees that if the Bond Amendment Agreements are approved, it will:
(a) continue to make Fixed Interest payments in respect of the Bonds when they become due under Clause 9.2 of the Bond Agreement during the period

<<<

 of the Maturity Date Extension (which Fixed Interest payments shall, for the avoidance of doubt, fall due on 30 June 2016 and 30 September 2016); and
(b) from 30 June 2016, pay the PIK Interest accruing pursuant to Clause 9 of the Bond Agreement

<<<

 in cash or in kind (at the Issuer's discretion) on each Interest Payment Date, and compound any PIK Interest paid in kind on a quarterly basis on each Interest Payment Date.
Should the Issuer fail to make any interest payments due under the

<<<

 Bond Agreement in accordance with the above provisions during the period of the Maturity Date Extension, it will constitute an immediate Event of Default.
2.3 Payment of Consent Fee
In consideration for, and as a condition to, the Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting approving the Bond Agreement Amendments, the Issuer is required to pay a consent fee to the Bondholders comprising an amount equal to 1% of the principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds as at 30 June 2016 (the "Consent Fee").
The Issuer

<<<

 shall pay the Consent Fee to the Bondholders on 30 June 2016. The Consent Fee shall be paid (at the Issuer's election) either:
(a) in cash; or
(b) through the issue of additional Bonds to the Bondholders, and for the avoidance of doubt, interest

<<<

 shall continue to accrue on those additional Bonds from (and including) 30 June 2016 at the aggregate of the Fixed Rate and the PIK Interest.
In either case, the Consent Fee will be payable to the Bondholders pro rata to the Bondholders' holdings

<<<

 of the Outstanding Bonds as at 30 June 2016. Should the Issuer fail to pay all or part of the Consent Fee, it will constitute an immediate Event of Default.

<<<

<<<

 expedited basis.

<<<

. The Bondholders must independently evaluate the Proposal and vote accordingly.

<<<

 Bondholders' tax or accounting affairs. Each Bondholder should consult their own independent legal advice in relation to any tax and/or accounting implications of the Bond Agreement Amendments and the Proposal.

4.3 Pre-acceptance

The Issuer

<<<

 has informed the Bond Trustee that Bondholders holding in excess of 93% of the Outstanding Bonds have indicated their support for the Proposal.
