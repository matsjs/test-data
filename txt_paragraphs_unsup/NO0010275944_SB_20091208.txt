1. BACKGROUND

In light of the contemplated

 demerger of Norses operations in Brazil and US announced

forward a restructuring proposal for all five bond loans of Norse. According to Norse it

is strongly

bond loans is an important step to achieve this goal. In Norse's view, the contemplated demerger and the proposed changes to the current Loan Agreements

<<<

 will create two stronger and more robust companies with distinct business cases. With this restructuring proposal, Norse is making a significant effort to address the various bondholders' interest, and it believes the proposal is balanced and

<<<

 fair.
In general terms, Norse proposes a change of borrower for NEC02, NEC03, NEC04 and NEC05 where the new borrower will be Norse Energy Holdings Inc, thus positioning bondholder closer to the US assets. NEC01 is consequently the only remaining

<<<

 bond in Norse "Brazil" following the demerger. All the bonds are extending maturity 1-2 years and in return, the Bondholders are compensated with (amongst other matters):
· Security by pledge over shares in relevant subsidiaries · Pledge over

<<<

 intercompany loans to relevant subsidiaries · Undertaking to issue in total minimum USD 50 million in new equity, to be
distributed equally between the US onshore and Brazil offshore operations · Early repayment of 15% of all outstanding bonds

<<<

 · Mandatory repayment in various scenarios · Increased interest coupon · Significantly stricter covenant structure including restriction on additional debt

2. THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT:

Norse puts forward the Amendment Proposal as set forth in the Amendment Documents

available

at

http://www.stamdata.no

and

Norse's

website,

http://www.norseenergycorp.com

<<<

. The Amendment Proposal is subject to the approval

from the bondholders and the finalisation and execution by the relevant parties of the

Amendment Documents and the security documents and other documents referred to

therein.

3. EVALUATION

<<<

 OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
3.1. Norse's evaluation
Norse continuously seeks growing Norse and to strengthen its position as an oil and gas company, and is currently contemplating a demerger of its operations onshore United States and offshore

<<<

 Brazil. In order to achieve this, it is paramount to amend Norse's capital structure in order to secure a strong financial platform. Given volatile financial markets and continued challenging industrial market conditions, Norse offers bondholders

<<<

 a secured, more balanced and less leveraged creditor position in return for extended debt maturity and increased structural headroom.
By consummating the proposed refinancing proposal Norse strongly believes it will improve all bondholders

<<<

' positions. Norse is making a significant effort to address the various bondholders' interest, and Norse believes the proposal is balanced and fair to all bondholders. In general, Norse proposes to extend the Bonds' maturity with 1-2 years

<<<

 and the proposal will provide Norse Energy with an improved amortization schedule that in turn will underpin the building of a stronger company both financially and operationally. Furthermore the proposal will provide Norse with sufficient

<<<

 time to properly capitalize on its huge resource base and unique competitive position in the US and Brazil.
In return for the lengthened maturity profile, Norse proposes to introduce security for the unsecured bonds and allocate bonds between

<<<

 the current borrower and the less leveraged US subsidiary NEHI. This should provide bondholders with increased comfort on their investments and add value to the various bonds.

6

N O R SK TILLITSM A N N ASA
www.trusiee.n o
USD ~90 million

<<<

1 of bonds (NEC02, NEC03, NEC04 and NEC05) will change borrower to NEHI and be secured with pledges in the New Borrower's shares and intercompany loans from NEHI to its subsidiaries. In addition there will be restriction on additional debt,

<<<

 a tighter covenant structure and offer to early prepayment in the event of selling interest directly or indirectly in the US onshore shale plays. This proposal adds significant security for the NEC02, NEC03, NEC04 and NEC05 bonds combined with

<<<

 isolating these from USD ~43 million of bond debt with shorter time to maturity.
For NEC01 the proposal entails the addition of security in one of Norse's most valuable assets, namely the Manati field. In the event of a sale of Manati, the

<<<

 bonds shall be repaid under the proposed offer to early prepayment. The bonds will be secured in shares and intercompany loans and the other unsecured bonds will be transferred to the US subsidiary thereby reducing the leverage in Norse.
As

<<<

 a means of strengthening the balance sheet, Norse is proposing that total new equity of minimum USD 50 million will be raised within 31 March 2011, thereby reducing the leverage of individual bonds. Minimum USD 25 million of the new equity

<<<

 shall be raised to the benefit of each group of bondholders, i.e. the bonds in the New Brasil Holding ASA and the bonds transferred to the New Borrower.
Norse continues to explore ways to maximize value through continued optimizing of its portfolio

<<<

 and corporate structure. In Norse's view the proposed changes to the current Loan Agreement(s) and joint proposal to all bondholders of Norse, will create a stronger and more robust company and will facilitate the establishment of two separate

<<<

 companies with distinct business cases. The proposal underlines Norse's strong commitment to continuously develop and deleverage Norse and should be attractive for all bondholders.
For further information about the Group, please refer to the

<<<

 web site http://www.norseenergycorp.com. Relevant documents can be obtained from Norse's website or registered office address at Strandveien 50, PO Box 262, 1326 Lysaker.
Norse has engaged Pareto Securities AS and First Securities AS as Norse

<<<

's financial advisors ("the Advisors") with respect to the Proposal. Bondholders may accordingly contact Pareto Securities Corporate Finance at +47 22 87 87 48 or +47 22 87 21 27 or First Securities Debt Capital Markets +47 23 11 62 66 or +

 disclaim any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal.

EXHIBIT 1: BACKGROUND
The following information regarding the operational and

<<<

 financial status o f Norse is provided by Norse. The Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with such information givenfrom Norse.
Operational update on Norse
During 2009, Norse has been able to both

<<<

 ramp-up its production and improve its financial position. Group production sales (adjusted for royalty and retainage) were 4,163 barrels of oil equivalents per day ("boe/day") in 2Q and increased 3% to 4,341 boe/day in 3Q. Production from

<<<

 the Manati field reached an all-time high of ~4,800 boe/day (~7.6 MMm3/day) on September 28, 2009, and group production is expected to continue to improve in 4Q due to increased demand in Brazil and new production coming on stream in the US

<<<

.
Norse has a balanced portfolio with a mix of producing assets in both the US and Brazil, as well as a near term development portfolio with significant resource base. Norse reported record generation of reserves and resources in 2008. The certified

<<<

 reserve reports estimate 2P reserves of 43.77 MMBOE, which, adjusted for the sale of the Medina assets in the US, is an increase of 14 %. Best estimate of contingent resources increased almost ten-fold from 39 MMBOE to 377 MMBOE. This reflects

<<<

 that the huge Marcellus and Utica shale potential has been accredited by Norse's third party reservoir engineer Schlumberger and added to the Herkimer resource base in the US. In Brazil, the comprehensive work to prepare for an integrated solution

<<<

 for the BS-3 development plan in the southern Santos Basin in Brazil, has been accredited by third party engineer Gaffney Cline & Associates through increased contingent resources.
Recently, land and leasehold transactions that have taken place

<<<

 in Pennsylvania and in New York State indicate a significant value potential from Norse's 130,000 acre land position. In November 2008, StatoilHydro farmed into 32.5% of Chesapeake's 1.8 million net acre position in Appalachia for a total consideration

<<<

 of ~5,800 USD/acre. Similarly, Fortuna Energy (Talisman) completed a 30,000 acres land transaction in Pennsylvania and New York State for a total consideration of -5,500 USD/acre in September 2009. Considering that gas prices in the past have

<<<

 been historically weak, the recent transactions indicate a strong belief in the profitability of developing the Marcellus shale play, which Norse has a part of.
In line with the previously communicated timeline, the New York Department of Environmental

<<<

 Conservation (NYDEC) recently released the draft Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement ("Draft SGEIS"). The Draft SGEIS outlines safety measures, protection standards and mitigation strategies that operators have to follow to

<<<

 obtain permits for shale gas development in New York State. There will be a public comment period open until December 31st, 2009. Norse expects additional transactions to be carried out in New York State once the regulation is in effect late

<<<

 2009 or early 2010.

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA www.mistce.no
Financial update on Norse In order to improve its financial position, Norse sold 30% of the shares in its subsidiary, Norse Energy do Brasil S.A., for a cash consideration of USD

<<<

 30 million during 2Q09. The-transaction was based on enterprise value of USD 210 million, whereby internal loan to Norse of USD 43 million were included. The buyer was Sector Speculare (Private Equity) IV, a fund managed by Sector Omega ASA

<<<

 ("Sector"). In addition to strengthening the balance sheet of Norse, the sale also provided Norse Energy do Brasil S.A. with a shareholder with a long term view of the potential in Brazil. Sector is also a major shareholder in Norse, controlling

<<<

 ~28 % of Norse. During Q3, Norse completed a private placement for a total of 35.3 million new shares, representing approximately 10% of the registered share capital. The private placement was oversubscribed and the subscription price was set

<<<

 to NOK 3.85 per share, giving gross proceeds of approximately NOK 136 million. In order to further strengthen Norse and improve its financial position, Norse believes that the proposal outlined in this letter shows Norse's commitment to repay

<<<

 the Bonds through a combination of a) available cash, b) mandatory early repayment in the event of asset sales and c) undertaking by Norse to raise significant new equity within the new extended maturity dates.
