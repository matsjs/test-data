Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

1.

INTRODUCTION

Nordic Trustee ASA (formerly known as Norsk Tillitsmann ASA) (the "Bond Trustee" or "Nordic Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders

<<<

") of the Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 (the "Bonds") issued by Sea Production Ltd (the "Issuer" or the "Company") and guaranteed by Puffin Ltd and Wisdom Shipping (S) Pte. Ltd.

All capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined

<<<

 herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Bonds (the "Bond Agreement") between the Company and the Bond Trustee originally dated 9 February 2007 (as amended and restated from time to time).

Bondholders are

<<<

 encouraged to carefully read this summons in its entirety.

2.

BACKGROUND

The Maturity Date of the Bonds is 14 September 2015. In order to facilitate repayment and/or refinancing of the Bonds, the Company believes that it would be helpful

<<<

 to have clarity on the future deployment of the Group's two vessels.

The Company and the charterers of Crystal Ocean have signed an extension of the existing contract for a further two years at a day rate of US$31,000 per day. Front Puffin

<<<

 remains in the shipyard in Singapore undergoing preparations for the contract with Folawiyo Aje Services Limited, for deployment at the Aje Field, offshore Nigeria. The vessel is expected to leave Singapore for Nigeria in Q4 2015. The exact

<<<

 timing of 1st oil remains to be determined, but is currently expected to occur in the first part of Q1 2016.

In light of the above, the Company proposes a medium-term extension of the Maturity Date of the Bonds to the Bondholders such that

<<<

 the definition of the Maturity Date of the Bonds be amended in the Bond Agreement from 14 September 2015 to 14 March 2016 (the "Maturity Extension").

In consideration for, and as a condition to, the Maturity Extension being approved by the

<<<

 requisite majority of the Bondholders, the Company:

301080419 v8
PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

 and disbursements; and

b. shall agree to co-operate with the Bond Trustee and its legal advisers in providing ongoing consultation and reasonable access to information and documentation,

during the period of the Maturity Extension (together

<<<

, the "Maturity Conditions"). Should the Maturity Conditions not be satisfied at any time, the Maturity Extension shall be capable of termination.

3.

PROPOSAL

Based on the foregoing, the Company has requested that the Bond Trustee put forward

<<<

 the following proposal (the "Proposal"):

Nordic Trustee is given a power of attorney to enter into all necessary agreements, letters, deeds and notices necessary or advisable

<<<

 (in the absolute discretion of Nordic Trustee) in connection with decisions made at the bondholders' meeting as well as to carry out all necessary completion work.
To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least (i) 2/3 of

<<<

 the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the duly convened meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order for the meeting to be quorate, (i) at least 5/10 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal

<<<

 is not adopted, the Bond Agreement will remain unchanged and the Proposed Transaction will not be implemented.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date.

<<<

 The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm

<<<

; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise the Nordic Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case

<<<

 the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Nordic Trustee to vote, must then be returned to Nordic Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please

<<<

 see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy,

<<<

 as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to

<<<

 Nordic Trustee, to notify Nordic Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (www.mail@trustee.no) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
