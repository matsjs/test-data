Oslo, 7 April 2014

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

1.

INTRODUCTION

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders 

<<<

(the "Bondholders") of the bond issue "FRN Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2014" with ISIN NO 001 036172.8 (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd (the "Company"). The terms

<<<

 and conditions of the Bonds are set out in the bond agreement dated 11 April 2007 between the Company and the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) as amended from time to time (the "Bond Agreement").

All capitalised terms used herein

<<<

 shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement or this summons (the "Summons") unless otherwise stated.

The information in this Summons regarding the legal, operational and financial status o f the Company is provided by the

<<<

 Company, and the Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its entirety.

2.

BACKGROUND

The current Maturity Date of the Loan is 16 April 2014 and

<<<

 the Borrower does not currently have sufficient funds available to it to repay the Loan in full on the current Maturity Date.

The Borrower is therefore in discussions with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "Committee") holding

<<<

 in excess of 66 2/3% of the principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, in relation to a possible restructuring of the terms of the Loan including an extension of the Maturity Date.

The Borrower is requesting a short extension to the maturity

<<<

 date of the Bonds to 16 June 2014 to allow these discussions to continue.

The Borrower therefore seeks an extension of the maturity date to 16 June 2014 (the "Extension"), with the other terms of the Bond Agreement remaining unchanged, save

<<<

 for

amendments to the definition of "Maturity Date". The Committee has indicated

<<<

 that its support for an extension of the Maturity Date to 16 June 2014 would be conditional upon (i) the Borrower meeting its interest payment obligations on 16 April 2014 and (ii) the Termination Right referred to below.

The "Term ination

<<<

 Right" means the right of Bondholders holding 2/3 by value of the Remaining Loan being able to terminate the Extension. The Extension may be terminated either by Bondholders approving the termination at a Bondholder Meeting or by the requisite

<<<

 percentage o f Bondholders giving 5 Banking Days' prior written notice of termination to the Company.

Upon termination of the Extension, the Extension will immediately cease to have effect and the Remaining Loan shall be immediately due and

<<<

 payable.

3.

THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

Based on the foregoing, the Borrower is seeking approval for the following amendments to the Bond Agreement:

The proposed deferral under the Bond Agreement

It is proposed that conditional upon the interest

<<<

 due on the Bonds being paid in full on the Interest Payment Date on 16 April 2014 and subject to the Termination Right, the Maturity Date of the Loan (currently 16 April 2014) shall be deferred until 16 June 2014.

For the avoidance of doubt

<<<

, the Borrower shall still be required to pay to the Bondholders in full the interest that is due on the Loan on the Interest Payment Date falling on 16 April 2014.

4.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSALS

The B orrow er's evaluation:

The Company

<<<

 believes that the proposal is the best interim solution for all stakeholders including the Bondholders in view of the Company's current financial situation.

Non-reliance of the Bond Trustee:

The proposal is put forward to the Bondholders

<<<

 without further evaluation or recommendations from die Bond Trustee or the Committee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal

<<<

 and financial advisers regarding the effect of the proposals.
