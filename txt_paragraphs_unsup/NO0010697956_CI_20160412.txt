 and employees.
According to the agreement, Atlantic Offshore AS sells most of its operations and subsidiaries to Aegopodium AS (the Buyer); a newly established company owned 100 per cent by H. Øgreid & Sønner AS. The main secured creditors

<<<

 in the Group are parties to the agreement.
"The last few months have been extremely challenging. In the past few weeks we have continued operations under guarantees from secured creditors in the subsidiaries and we are pleased that there is

<<<

 now finally a solution. We have secured jobs for more than 400 skilled employees and ensured continued and uninterrupted services for more than ten offshore fields in Norway and the UK", says Roy Wareberg, CEO of Atlantic Offshore AS. He will

"It has been a tough time for all parties involved and we sympathise with those who sustain losses. However, we are confident that the result represents the best possible solution for all stakeholders

<<<

", Wareberg continues.
"The weak market will continue to be a challenge for several years, and we need to take further steps to ensure our continued competitiveness. Several contracts are up for extension later this year, and we will work hard

<<<

 to earn the trust of our customers and secure the value of our business", Wareberg says.
Background
The board and management of Atlantic Offshore AS (the Company) have been pursuing a broad range of strategic options, financial as well as industrial

<<<

, for more than a year. In the middle of February this year, the Board presented a restructuring solution in the market that had support from the main stakeholders. However, such solution was rejected by the bondholders in the ATOFF03 2013/

<<<

2018 bond issue (the Bond Loan) in a bondholder meeting on 4 March 2016.
Since then the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Group) have been working on various new restructuring alternatives, including a revised capital

<<<

 structure involving the Bond Loan, as well as transaction and liquidation scenarios.
By entering into an agreement with its main secured creditors and Aegopodium AS (the Master Agreement), the Company has achieved a solution that will result

<<<

 in continuation of the industrial operations for the benefit of employees, customers, suppliers and other relevant parties.

The agreement
The parties to the Master Agreement are the Company and most of its subsidiaries, the Buyer and its

<<<

 100 per cent owner H. Øgreid & Sønner AS, as well as the main secured creditors of the Group. The Master Agreement involves transfer of the shares in Atlantic Offshore Gamma AS, Atlantic Offshore Alpha AS, Atlantic Offshore Epsilon AS, Atlantic

<<<

 Offshore Eta AS, Atlantic Offshore Zeta AS, Atlantic Offshore Management AS and Atlantic Offshore Crew AS to the Buyer or subsidiaries of the Buyer.
In addition, the Buyer has through its subsidiaries acquired certain assets and personnel in

<<<

 Atlantic Offshore Rescue Ltd and the shares in Atlantic Offshore Crewing Services Ltd and Atlantic Offshore Scotland Ltd from the administrator appointed in the UK with respect to Atlantic Offshore Rescue Ltd.
The consideration in the Transaction

<<<

 is NOK 16.9 million, based on multiple valuations made by external experts and verified by third party. The new Buyer group has been capitalised with NOK 70 million, of which the owner provide NOK 50 million and certain secured creditors grant

<<<

 a convertible loan in the amount of NOK 20 million.
Next steps
Subsequent to completion of the transactions, the Company and the Norwegian Group companies Atlantic Offshore Beta AS, Atlantic Offshore Delta AS and Team Atlantic AS will file

<<<

 for bankruptcy in due course. The Scottish Group companies Atlantic Offshore Rescue Ltd and Atlantic Offshore Aberdeen Ltd have become subject to a court appointed administration process, in which EY is nominated as administrator.
Given the

<<<

 situation of the Company subsequent to the transaction, the parties to the Master Agreement have agreed on a reversal clause for the benefit of the Company and its bankruptcy estate for a period of 90 days after the Transaction.
