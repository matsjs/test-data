Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1. Reporting entity
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. (hereafter "the Company") is a private limited liability company domiciled in the Netherlands. The Company's registered office is at Zwolseweg

<<<

 1, 2994 LB, Barendrecht and has its legal seat in Rotterdam. The Company is registered at the Chamber of Commerce with registration number 58848754. These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively

<<<

 the `Group' and individually `Group companies') together operating as Veritas Petroleum Services Group. The Group primarily provides testing and survey services to the Maritime industry.
Veritas Petroleum Services Holding B.V. is the holding

<<<

 company of the Veritas Petroleum Services group. The parents of the group are VPS International S.a.r.l. (50%), DET Norske Veritas Holding AS (47%) and VPS Management Holding B.V. (3%). The ultimate parent of VPS International S.a.r.l. is IK

<<<

 VII Limited.
The operations of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its group companies are mainly comprised of participating in, financing and managing of other companies, as well as serving the Maritime industry since launching their commercial

<<<

 Fuel Quality Testing (FQT) services in 1981. The Group offers a wide range of fuel management services to assist ship operators, power plant operators and other industry operators with total fuel management solutions, delivering measurable

<<<

 improvements to risk management, cost and operational efficiency and compliance with regulatory requirements.
2. Basis of accounting and measurement
These consolidated statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial

<<<

 Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared at the historical cost convention, except for

<<<

 the net defined benefit (asset) liability, which has been accounted for at fair value or the plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
These consolidated financial statements reflect all of the assets, liabilities

<<<

, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Group (See note 27 for an overview of the Group legal entities) and disclose all matters relevant to Veritas Petroleum Services B.V.'s ability to continue as a going concern. Veritas Petroleum Services

<<<

 B.V. has the intent and ability to undertake necessary precautions to continue on a going concern basis.

Details of the

<<<

 Group's accounting policies are included in Notes 5 and 6.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of United States Dollars (USD), which is the Company's functional currency.


<<<

3. Use of judgements and estimates
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group's accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets

<<<

, liabilities income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued

<<<

)
Estimated and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
Critical estimates, judgements and errors The areas involving significant estimates or judgements are related to
Note

<<<

 14 - impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amount
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial

<<<

 impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Measurement of fair values A number of the Group's disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities

<<<

. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques

<<<

 as follows.
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices

<<<

) or indirectly (i.e derived from prices). Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different

<<<

 levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entire in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers

<<<

 between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in:
Note 14 - impairment test: key assumptions

<<<

 underlying recoverable amount; and Note 20 - employee benefits: based on actuarial calculations.
4. Changes in accounting policies
Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in Note 5 to

<<<

 all periods presented in this consolidated financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following new standards, amendments to a standard including any consequential amendments to other standards, and new interpretations with an effective

<<<

 date for annual periods beginning after or on 1 January 2016.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments - Disclosures (2005)
The nature and effects of the changes are explained below.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments - Disclosures (2005)
IFRS 7 (2005) requires

<<<

 disclosure of information about the significance of financial instruments to an entity, and the nature and extent of risks arising from those financial instruments, both in qualitative and quantitative terms. Where relevant, the Group has applied

<<<

 the amendments to IFRS 7 that became effective in 2016. The adoption of these amendments and interpretations did not have a material impact on the Company's financial performance or disclosures.

5. Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented

<<<

 in these consolidated financial statements. Certain comparative amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified and/ or more in detail presented in line with the guidelines of IAS 1.
Basis of consolidation
Business

<<<

 combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net

<<<

 assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity

<<<

 instruments.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at

<<<

 the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent

<<<

 changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns

<<<

 from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to influence those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control

<<<

 commences until the date on which control ceases.
Transaction eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra group transactions, are eliminated.
Foreign currency

<<<


Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency'). The

<<<

 financial statements are presented in United States dollars which is the group's presentation currency and equals the functional currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using

<<<

 the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates

<<<

 of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within

<<<

 finance income or cost.

Group companies All the results and financial position

<<<

 of the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) are measured in the Group's functional currency.
Revenue
Rendering of services Main activity of the Group is performing services to the Maritime industry

<<<

. The Group entered different type of billing arrangement with its customers. Revenue from rendering services as far as these are completed at the reporting date and when the transaction can be estimated reliable are recognised in profit or

<<<

 loss. Received amounts from service arrangements wherefore services are not completed at reporting date are recognised as deferred income.
Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred

<<<

 to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, if there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured

<<<

 reliably. Revenue is measured based on net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Expenses Expenses arising from the company's business operations are accounted for as operating expenses in the year incurred. Losses originating before

<<<

 the end of the financial year are taken into account if they have become known before preparation of the financial statements.
Employee benefits The group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined

<<<

 contribution pension plans.
Pension obligations A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions

<<<

 if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on

<<<

 retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation

<<<

 at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation

<<<

 is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the

<<<

 terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions

<<<

 are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary

<<<

 basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a

<<<

 cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The Company's branch office in United Arab Emirates provides end of service benefits to its employees. The entitlement of these benefits is based upon the employees' final salary

<<<

 and length of service, subject to the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accounted for based on the Project Unit Credit Method (PUCM) over the period of employment.
Finance income and finance costs

<<<

 The group's finance income and finance costs include:
Interest income; Interest expenses; Dividend income; The net gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities; Foreign currency translation.
Interest income or expense is recognised

<<<

 using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss and the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established.
Income tax Income tax expenses comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised

<<<

 in profit or loss for except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in Other Comprehensive Income.
Current tax Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable

<<<

 income or loss for the year and any adjustments to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising

<<<

 from dividends.
Current tax assets and liabilities are only offset if certain criteria are met.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial

<<<

 reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for:
Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and the affects

<<<

 neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they

Notes to the consolidated

 financial statements (continued)

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which

<<<

 they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future

<<<

 taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

Deferred

<<<

 tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences

<<<

 that would follow from the manner in which the group expects, at reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is

<<<

 presumed to be recovered through sale, and the Group has not rebutted this resumption.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Property, plant and equipment

Recognition and measurement Property, plant

<<<

 and equipment are non-current assets used in the operating activities of the Group with a useful life of over one year. An item of property, plant and equipment is initially recognised at its acquisition cost which consists of the purchase

<<<

 price and other expenditures directly related to the acquisition that are necessary for bringing the asset to its operating condition and location.

An item of property, plant and equipment is subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated

<<<

 depreciation and any impairment losses.

Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure incurred for an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as a non-current asset when it is probable that the Group will derive future economic

<<<

 benefits from it and its cost can be measured reliably.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within `Other expense & income' in the consolidated statement of profit

<<<

 or loss and other comprehensive income.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives

<<<

, and is generally recognised in `Depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Land is not depreciated.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative

<<<

 years of significant items of Property, Plant and Equipment are as follows:

Intangible assets and goodwill
Intangibles - Customer relationships Separately acquired customer relationships are shown at historical cost. Customer relationships in a business combination

<<<

 are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over

<<<

 their estimated useful lives with a maximum of 17 years.
Intangibles - software Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the

<<<

 design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be

<<<

 available for use; management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; there is an ability to use or sell the software product; it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits

<<<

; adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured
Directly

<<<

 attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised

<<<

 as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives

<<<

 using the straight-line method, which does not exceed five years.
Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. interest in net fair

<<<

 value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination

<<<

 is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the

<<<

 goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Financial Instruments The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial

<<<

 assets, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.

Share capital Ordinary

<<<

 shares are classified as share capital. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Share-based payment Selected managers of the

<<<

 group participate in VPS Holding B.V. ("the Company") through indirect share ownership via a management holding company. In relation with a change in control event, the shares will be settled in cash either by the majority shareholder or the

<<<

 acquirer. The Company or another group entity will under no circumstances be required to settle in cash. Accordingly, this arrangement is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement.
The Company determines the fair value

<<<

 of the shares at the grant date and recognises, if applicable, an expense for the services received over the service period with a corresponding increase in equity. Only if the purchase price is lower than the actual market value of the shares

<<<

 at the grant date, or if the selling price is above actual market value at the date of sale, this results in a fair value to be reported as a share-based payment expense.
Impairment of financial assets A financial asset is impaired if its carrying

<<<

 amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. An assessment is made at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is objective evidence that a specified asset, or a group of similar assets, may be impaired. If such evidence

<<<

 exists any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount of an interestbearing instrument is determined based on the net present value of future cash flows discounted at original effective interest rates. Any

<<<

 impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the

<<<

 difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate 

<<<

(i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount

<<<

 of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset

<<<

 does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence

<<<

 (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is

<<<

 reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debtors are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Impairment of non-financial assets Non-financial assets, like property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other

<<<

 than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or

<<<

 changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount

<<<

 obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction, whilst value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful

<<<

 life. The discount rate used for value-in-use calculations is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of

<<<

 an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years (other than goodwill) is recorded as

<<<

 income when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised for the asset no longer exist or have decreased.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers for products provided and services

<<<

 performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets

<<<

. Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents In the statement of cash flows, cash

<<<

 and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within

<<<

 borrowings in current liabilities.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the qualifying borrowing are added to the cost of the borrowing and amortised over

<<<

 the same period of the borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, which is the amount received plus or minus any premium or discount, less transaction costs. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs

<<<

) and the redemption value is recognised as interest in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right

<<<

 to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for products and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course

<<<

 of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities

<<<

. Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Leases At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether the arrangements is or contains

<<<

 a lease.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
At interception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease

<<<

, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that is impracticable

<<<

 to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and liability are recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of underlying assets; subsequently, the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance cost on the liability

<<<

 is recognised using the group's incremental borrowing rate.
Lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as

<<<

 an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of lease.
Cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature

<<<

, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. Corporate income taxes, issuance of share capital, interest received and dividends

<<<

 received are presented under the cash flow from operating activities. The bond loan, buy backs of the loan, interest paid and dividends paid are presented under the cash flow from financing activities. Acquisition of assets and the cost of

<<<

 group companies acquired is presented under the cash flow from investment activities, as far as payment has been made with cash and cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents of the group companies acquired are deducted from the purchase

<<<

 cost.

6. Standards issued but not yet adopted

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are issued but not yet mandatorily effective (but early adoption is allowed) for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2016; however, the

<<<

 Group has not applied the following new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements.

New or amended standards
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

Summary of the requirements
IFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces the existing

<<<

 guidance in IAS 39 Financials instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on

<<<

 financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or

<<<

 after January 2018, with early adoption permitted.

Key assumptions

Pre-tax cash flow

<<<

 projections in the fair value less costs of disposal calculation are mainly dependent on the development of the revenue growth rate. Management estimates the assumptions based on the past performance, expected general market developments and

<<<

 potentials in the market. The management key assumptions over a 4-year forecast period can be specified as follows:

Management forecast projection (4 years) Revenue Budgeted EBITDA growth rate Capex (in USD Millions)

2017 - 2020 12.90* 1

<<<

8.20* 15.2

2016-2019 3.00% 5.00% 9.0

The Company's expected growth will be supported by offering our existing services to new markets, the introduction of new services and introducing innovative services to provide additional tests on existing

<<<

 samples. Budgeted EBITDA was estimated taking into account past experience, adjusted as follows.

Revenue growth was projected taking into account the average growth levels experienced within the Maritime Industry and expected growth in new

<<<

 services. Significant one-off (post) acquisition, refinance and organisational restructuring costs are excluded from budgeted EBITDA.

The Company will focus on cost efficiency projects and invest in laboratory equipment to facilitate efficiencies

<<<

 and new services. By introducing new services, investment in new and existing equipment and focus on (new) business development, management aims to increase the market share in the next four years.

The weighted average pre-tax discount rate

<<<

 and terminal value growth rate are as follows:

In percent
Discount rate Terminal value growth

2017-2020 11.00% 2.00%

2016-2019 8.00% 2.00%

The discount rate was a post-tax measure estimated based on the observable Maritime industry weighted

<<<

-average cost of capital. The terminal growth rate was determined based on management's estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumption that a market participant would make.

The impairment analysis

<<<

 in 2016 did not result in an impairment. The recoverable amount of CGU being USD 129 million exceeded its carrying amount of USD 119 million by USD 10 million (headroom).
Sensitivity analysis
Management has identified that a deviation in key

<<<

 assumptions could lead to a carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount. The following table shows a sensitivity (percentage point change per key assumption) resulting in a headroom of nil:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations

<<<

, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to a large number of customer contracts which are unrelated. Therefore the Group believes that no additional credit risk provision

<<<

 is required besides the normal provision for bad debt.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

Trade and other receivables The Group established an allowance for impairment that reflects its estimate

<<<

 of incurred losses in respect of the indicated credit risks regarding trade receivables. For the sales occurred during 2016, the credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers

<<<

 the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate. Further details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 7.

A credit policy has

<<<

 been established where each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group reviews external ratings, if they are available, and in some

<<<

 cases bank references. For all new customers a creditworthiness check is performed and for existing customers the creditworthiness is reviewed on a yearly basis.

 and cash equivalents are held by bank counter parties, which are rated AA-, based on Standard & Poor's ratings.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with

 its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal

 and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.

The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow forecast model. This model considers the maturity of both its

 non-current and current assets and liabilities (trade receivables and other financial assets or liabilities) and projected cash flows from operations.

The Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents at an amount in excess

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

The Group has an unsecured bond loan that contains loan covenants. A future breach of covenants may require the Group to repay the loan earlier than indicated in the

<<<

 above table. Under the agreement, the covenants are monitored on a regular basis by the Group finance team and regularly reported to the management to ensure compliance with the agreement.

As a result the Group monitors its liquidity (minimum

<<<

 of USD 5 million) as well as its capital on the basis of the gearing ratio covenant as part of the bond agreement. This ratio is calculated as net interest bearing debt divided by EBITDA. Net interest bearing debt is calculated as total aggregated

<<<

 loans and borrowings less shareholder loans and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. The EBITDA is calculated as `earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and before exceptional items'. The covenant includes a maximum

<<<

 gearing ratio of 4.75% per end of 2016. Per 31 December 2016, the Group complied with all quarterly and annual covenant requirements.

The interest payments on the shareholders loan and bond issues in the table above are based on fixed interest

<<<

 rates as disclosed in note 19. In addition, the interest rate of the shareholders loan will be accrued for and for that reason a cash outflow at repayment date. It is not expected that cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur

<<<

 significantly earlier or at significant different amounts.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its

<<<

 holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The Group is closely monitoring the world economy as the Group

<<<

's sales is depending on the developments in marine fuel market.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, purchases and borrowings are denominated and the

<<<

 respective functional currencies of Group companies. The functional currencies of the Group is US dollar. The currencies in which these transactions are primarily denominated are US dollar, Euro, Singapore Dollar and Norwegian Krone.

The group

<<<

's borrowings are denominated in US dollar that match the cash flow generated by the underlying operations of the Group - primarily in US dollar. In addition, interest on borrowings is denominated in the currency of the borrowing. This provides

<<<

 an economic hedge without derivatives being entered into and therefore hedge accounting is not applied in these circumstances.

Exposure to currency risk The summary quantitative data about the Group's exposure to currency risk as reported

<<<

 to the management of the Group is as follows per 31 December 2016.

Interest rate risk The Group's interest exposure is nil as all its borrowings are at a fixed rate. In addition, the Group's policy is not to enter borrowing

<<<

 agreements with a floating rate.

25. Commitments
Leases as lessee The Group leases a number of offices and laboratory facilities under operating leases. The leases typically run for a period between five and ten years, with an option to renew

<<<

 these leases after that date. Lease payments are renegotiated at the end of the lease period to reflect the market rentals. As such the Group renegotiated a new lease agreement for the Barendrecht office in 2016. Some leases provide additional

<<<

 rent payments that are based on changes in local price indices. For certain operating leases, the Group is restricted from entering into any sub-lease arrangements. The offices and laboratory lease were entered into pre-acquisition which is

<<<

 three years ago as combined lease of land and buildings. The Group determined that the land and building elements of the offices and laboratories leases are operating leases.
The rent paid to the landlord is adjusted to market rentals at regular

<<<

 intervals, and the Group does not have an interest in the residual value of the land and building elements of the offices and laboratories. As a result, it was determined that substantially all the risks and rewards of the land and building

<<<

 elements of the offices and laboratories are with the landlord.
Furthermore, the Group has liabilities relating to operating leases for cars provided to employees, each lease having a term of up to four years.

The basisfor

<<<

 our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section `Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial

<<<

 statements' of our report.
Independence
We are independent of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. in accordance with the `Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten' (ViO) and other relevant independence requirements

<<<

 in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the `Verordening gedrags- en heroepsregels accountants' (VGBA).
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Our

<<<

 audit approach Overview and context
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its group of companies offers a wide range of fuel management services, focusing on fuel quality testing and bunker quantity surveys. The Group comprises of several components

<<<

 and therefore we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out in `The scope of our group audit' section. We paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Company, as set out below.
We designed our

<<<

 audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the management made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates

<<<

 that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In paragraph 3 of the financial statements the company describes the areas of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation

<<<

 uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty in the impairment assessment of goodwill, we considered it to be a key audit matter as set out in the key audit matter section of this report.
Besides the key audit matters, other areas

<<<

 of focus were revenue recognition, accuracy of accrued and deferred revenue, and the unsecured bond loan including the settlement of transactions and compliance with debt covenants. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management

<<<

 override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels

<<<

 included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a provider of fuel quality testing services and bunker quantity surveys. We therefore included specialists in the areas of IT and valuations in our team.

The outlines of our audit approach were as follows:

Materiality

·

Overall materiality: US$482,000 which represents 1% of the total

revenue.

Audit scope

·

We conducted audit

<<<

 work on five components.

·

Four components were subject to audits of their complete set of

financial information (`full scope audit') and were audited by teams

based in the Netherlands and Singapore.

·

For the remaining component, specific

<<<

 audit procedures have been

performed in order to increase our audit coverage on some financial

statements line items.

·

Audit coverage: 100% of consolidated revenue, 99% of consolidated

total assets and 99% of consolidated profit before

<<<

 tax.

Key audit matters

·

Valuation of goodwill.

Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality which is further explained in the section `Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

<<<

'.

We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures

<<<

 and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Overall group materiality How we determined it Rationalef

<<<

 o r benchmark applied
Component materiality

US$ 482,000 (2015: US$ 521,000)
1% of total revenue We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial

<<<

 statements. The company has a relatively fixed cost base up to a certain level of activities given the nature of those activities. The financial performance is therefore mainly reflected through the company's revenue developments. This results

<<<

 in the company's revenue being a significant determining factor for the EBITDA. Based on the aforementioned and our understanding of the key stakeholders we determined revenue to be the appropriate benchmark. To each component in our audit

<<<

 scope, we, based on our judgement, allocate materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between US$ 320,000 and US$ 480,000.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. - Ref.:

<<<

 60400333 Page 3 of 9

pwc

We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are material for qualitative reasons.

We agreed with the management that we would report to them misstatements identified

<<<

 during our audit above US$ 24,000 (2015: US$ 26,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
The scope o f our group audit
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. is the parent company

<<<

 of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V.

The Group's accounting process is structured around a local finance function in each of

<<<

 the three regions ("Europe", "Americas" and "Africa, Middle East & Asia") in which the Group operates through four components besides the parent entity. These functions maintain their own accounting records and controls and report to the head

<<<

 office finance team in the Netherlands through an integrated consolidation system.

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into

<<<

 account: the geographic and management structure of the Group, including the nature of operations; the accounting processes and controls; and the markets in which the Group operates.

Four components, including the parent company, were subjected

<<<

 to audits of their complete set of financial information as those components are individually significant to the Group. The other three components are: Veritas Petroleum Services Asia Pte. Ltd, Veritas Petroleum Services Europe B.V. and VPS

<<<

 Testing & Inspection Inc. We further performed audit procedures of specific account balances at Veritas Petroleum Services AS in order to obtain sufficient coverage of specific financial statement line items in the consolidated financial statements

<<<

.

Taken together our audit coverage as defined in percentages in the table below is based on the full scope audits performed as well as the audit procedures of specific account balances as described above.

In current year the group engagement team performed the audit procedures for all components, except for the taxation of Veritas Petroleum Services Asia Pte. Ltd. For this purpose a component auditor was involved.

Where the

 work was performed by the component auditor, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the

<<<

 consolidated financial statements as a whole.

By performing the procedures above, we have obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the group as a whole to provide a basis for our opinion on

<<<

 the consolidated financial statements.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. - Ref.: 00400333 Page 4 of 9

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the

<<<

 financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the management, but they are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters that were identified by our audit and that we discussed. We described the key audit matters and included

<<<

 a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion

<<<

 on these matters or on specific elements of the financial statements. Any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.

Due to the nature of the company's activities we recognize that the key audit matter

<<<

 which we reported in our independent auditor's report on the financial statements 2015 is continuing to be significant in the audit of the financial statements and therefore may not change significantly year over year. As compared to prior

<<<

 year there have been no changes in key audit matters.

Key audit matter________________________ How our audit addressed the matter________

Valuation o fgoodwill Note 14b
In 2013 the Company acquired DNV Petroleum Services AS and its subsidiaries

<<<

. At the acquisition date goodwill was recognized of US$ 64 million (refer to note 14b), which is grouped together with customer relationships and other assets of the group under one cash generating unit with the carrying value of US$ 119 million

<<<

 as of 31 December 2016. Management performed the required annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with IAS 36, `Impairment of Assets' and concluded that a headroom of US$ 10 million exists over the carrying amount of the cash generating

<<<

 unit.
The assumptions in the impairment test include components of the EBITDA projections such as revenue growth based on the growth levels within the industry, expected growth in new services, expected developments of prices and quantity of

<<<

 services to be provided and the costs base driven by these developments. Other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rate as well as the discount rate. The assumptions are further disclosed in note 14b to the financial statements

<<<

. The impairment test is significant to our audit as it requires significant management judgement, and it is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market conditions.

We evaluated management's determination of the cash generated

<<<

 unit for the purpose of the impairment test. We concur with management's determination of the cash generating unit and carrying value.
We assessed and challenged the underlying assumptions used in the model. We paid particular attention to

<<<

 the assumptions related to EBITDA projections, through gaining a detailed understanding from management of the underlying revenue growth levels within the industry, expected growth in new services and expected developments of prices and quantity

<<<

 of services to be provided. We have compared this forecast with historical performance of the Group and external market data available from external parties. We have evaluated the impact on the costs used in the EBITDA forecast based on the

<<<

 cost efficiency projects comparing the forecast with historical pattern and assessing the exclusion of non-recurring costs from forecast. We concluded that the assumptions used are within the acceptable range.
Furthermore we assessed the terminal

<<<

 value growth rate and the discount rate. We performed a peer group analysis to assess the discount rate and verified the terminal value growth rate by using market data obtained from external parties. In addition we performed testing procedures

<<<

 over the mathematical accuracy of the calculations performed by management. We noted no material exceptions and concluded that the rates applied are within the acceptable range.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. - Ref.: 00400333 Page 5 of 9

pwc

Key audit matter________________________
Furthermore, the outcome of the test is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions so a change in assumptions could lead to an impairment charge.

How our audit addressed the matter________
Moreover

<<<

, we have challenged the recoverable amount by using an independent peer group multiple EBITDA analysis prepared by PwC valuation specialists. Based on the aforementioned audit procedures, the recoverable amount was determined in the acceptable

<<<

 range.

We also focused on the adequacy of the Company's disclosures regarding the assumptions, including the sensitivity analyses (as included in note 14b). We concluded on the adequacy of these disclosures in the financial statements e.

R ep o rt on the other inform ation included in the annual report

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, the annual report contains

other information that consists of:

 information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:

·

is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements

;

·

contains all information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have

<<<

 considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.

By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially

 less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

 to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the management should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to liquidate the

Our responsibilitiesfor the audit o f thefinancial statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion.

 Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance which makes it possible that we may not detect

 all misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of

 the financial statements. Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out

In addition to what is included in our auditor's report we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities

 for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.

The auditor's responsibilitiesfo r the audit o f thefinancial statements

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism

<<<

 throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material

<<<

 misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:

· Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and

<<<

 performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than

<<<

 for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.

·

Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order

<<<

 to design audit

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an

opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control.

·

Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used

<<<

 and the reasonableness of

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

·

Concluding on the appropriateness of the management' use of the going concern basis of

accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained

<<<

, concluding whether a material

uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the

company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty

exists, we are required

<<<

 to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the

financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our

<<<

 auditor's report

and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However,

future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

·

Evaluating the overall presentation

<<<

, structure and content of the financial statements, including

the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying

transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Considering our

<<<

 ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the

<<<

 audit procedures for components of the group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the group, the significance and/or

<<<

 risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances

<<<

 was considered necessary.

We communicate with the management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify

<<<

 during our audit.
