1 Background and proposals

1.1 Introduction

The Tranche B Bonds, the Tranche Cl Bonds and the Tranche C2 Bonds mature on 18 March 2016. The Parent Guarantor is together with York trying to

<<<

 resolve the situation at Davie Yard as well as negotiating a general restructuring of the capital structure of the Group with all stakeholders. In order to give the Group time to both resolve and address the situation at Davie Yard and finalize

<<<

 the restructuring negotiations, it is proposed that the Bondholders approve the following:

(a)

Extension of the Maturity Date o f Tranche B Bonds, the Tranche Cl Bonds and Tranche C2

Bonds

NORDIC TRUSTEE

Background'. The Tranche B Bonds, the Tranche C l Bonds and the Tranche C2 Bonds mature on 18 March 2016.

Proposal. The Issuers propose that the Bondholders approve the extension of the Maturity

<<<

 Date for the Tranche B Bonds, the Tranche Cl Bonds and the Tranche C2 Bonds with 12 months to 18 March 2017 (with respect to each of the Tranche B Bonds, the Tranche Cl Bonds and the Tranche C2 Bonds individually, the "Junior Extension Proposal

<<<

").

Accrued interest on the relevant Bonds will continue to be paid and settled through the issue of Additional Bonds (as per Clause 8.2 of the Bond Agreement).

(b)

Additional senior financial indebtedness

Background'. The delays at Davie

<<<

 Yard have strained the liquidity of the Group. Moreover, the Group needs additional funds to continue monitoring, negotiating and taking action with respect to Davie Yard and the Vessels. The Intercreditor Agreement contains certain restrictions

<<<

 on the increase of senior bonds.

Proposal: The Issuers propose that the Bondholders approve the incurrence of up to additional USD 7,000,000 of senior secured, interest bearing bonds under the New Bond Agreement (which is the senior bond agreement

<<<

) ("New Additional Bonds") and where:

(i)

the New Additional Bonds will constitute New Bonds (which are the exisiting

bonds issued under the senior bond agreement) for the purpose o f the Finance

Documents;

(ii)

the New Additional Bonds

<<<

 will be secured under the New Bond Security with

priority ahead of the Bonds;

(iii) the Additional New Bonds will have the same benefit of the Intercreditor Agreement similar as the New Bonds and whereby the Bonds will be subordinated to

<<<

 the Additional New Bonds;

(iv) the New Additional Bonds will rank ahead of, pari passu with or behind the existing New Bonds;

(v)

the ordinary interest rate on the Additional New Bonds shall not exceed 20 per cent

p.a.; and

(vi) the net

<<<

 proceeds of the Additional New Bonds will be applied against the general working capital requirements of the Group,

(the "Additional Senior Financing Proposal").

(c)

Payment obligations to the New Bonds

Background: The relevant Issuers have had to ask the holders of the New Bonds (predominately York) for extensions on the maturity dates of the New Bonds. The holders of the New Bonds have

<<<

 consented to this on the condition that certain extension fees are paid and which have been disclosed to the Bondholders in several letters from the Issuers. The total amount of such fees are, as at the date hereof, USD 9,118,332 and remain

<<<

 unpaid. The Intercreditor Agreement contains certain restrictions on increasing the interest payable on the New Bonds and the extension fees might (although none of the Issuers believe this to be the case) be covered by these restrictions.

<<<

 York will most likely be providing all or a substantial part of the Additional Financing and the relevant members of the Group will have to ask the holders of the New Bonds for additional extensions of the maturity dates of the New Bonds and

<<<

 the proposals below are meant to incentivize York and the other holders of the New Bonds to provide the Additional Financing as well as to grant additional extensions.

Proposal: The Issuers propose that Bondholders approval of, under clause

<<<

 8,1 of the Intercreditor Agreement,:

(i)

the existing agreed extension fees of USD 9,118,332; and

(ii)

any future extension fees or other amounts payable agreed by the Issuers with

respect to an extension of the maturity dates of any New

<<<

 Bonds, provided that the

extension fee or other amount payable shall not (together with any other amount

payable and calculated by reference to the relevant period of extension) exceed an

annualized interest rate on the relevant New Bonds

<<<

 in excess of 20 per cent p.a.,

in each case so that any approved extension fee or other amount payable shall be considered to constitute First Indebtedness for the purpose of the Intercreditor Agreement and will be treated as a part of the

<<<

 New Bonds and which will rank in priority to the Bonds (the "Senior Extension Payments Proposal").

(d)

Consent to continue operations

Background: The Issuers have for a long time been working on finding solutions to the challenges concerning

<<<

 Davie Yard and the completion of the Vessels as well as towards a general restructuring of the capital structure of the Group. Although progress has, in the opinion of the Issuers, been made on all fronts, there is still much work to be done

<<<

 and successful outcomes cannot be guaranteed. Equity value in the Group is lost and for each day the Issuers continue their operations both senior and junior debt increases due to interest accumulation. Furthermore, working capital and cash

<<<

 resources are reduced each day and the raising of additional working capital will increase the amount of secured senior debt in the capital structure (ref. the Additional Financing above). The Issuers believe that the best way to secure potential

<<<

 value for all stakeholders is for the Issuers and the Obligors to continue their operations on finding solutions that will preserve or increase value - and that there are better prospects of the Issuers being successful in this compared to

<<<

 the alternative - and which is that the Issuers file for bankruptcy and where York and the other senior creditors enforce their senior security over all assets.

Proposal. The Issuers and Obligors propose that the Bondholders acknowledge and consent to the Issuers' and Obligors' continued operations in trying to preserve or increase value for all relevant stakeholders even if the equity

<<<

 in the Group is lost and even if debts are increased and that no Obligor, member of the board in any Obligor or any employee, agent or representative of any Obligor shall be held liable for continuing operations or taking other actions in trying

<<<

 to preserve or increase value for the relevant stakeholders (the "General Approval").
The Junior Extension Proposal, the Additional Senior Financing Proposal, the Senior Extension Payments Proposal and the General Approval is jointly referred
