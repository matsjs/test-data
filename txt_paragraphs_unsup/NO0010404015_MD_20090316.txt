The extension of the

<<<

 grace period is granted on the condition that the Interest of the Loan is increased with 5.00 per cent p.a. so that the principal and outstanding interest amount of the Loan shall accrue interest at NIBOR + Margin + 5 per cent p.a. with effect

<<<

 from the interest due date 17 March 2009 until the date such payment is made, or otherwise solved through an agreement with the Bondholders formalized by a Bondholders' meeting. The increased interest rate reflects the interest rate of the

<<<

 Loan if the Loan was declared in default.
Pursuant to the Loan Agreement Clause 16.2, such decision may not be approved by the Loan Trustee alone if any bondholder submits a written protest against the proposal.
Therefore, if no bondholders

<<<

 submit a written objection to the proposal within the end of the business day 24 March 2009 (4 p.m. Norwegian time), the due date for the interest payment originally due 17 March 2009 will be postponed with three weeks until 3 April 2009.
Any

<<<

 written objection must be sent to the Loan Trustee via regular mail, telefax or e-mail (please see address etc. at the bottom of the first page of this letter).
