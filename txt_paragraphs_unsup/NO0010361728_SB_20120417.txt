Oslo, 17 April 2012

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Proposal for amendments

 to the Loan Agreement

1

INTRODUCTION

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bond issue "FRN Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2014" with ISIN

<<<

 NO 001 036172.8 (the "Bonds" or the "Loan") where Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd (the "Company") is the issuer and borrower.

All capitalised terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement for

<<<

 the Loan (the "Loan Agreement") between the Company and the Loan Trustee dated 11 April 2007, as amended on 10 March 2011.

The information in this Summons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status o f the Company is provided by

<<<

 the Company, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its entirety.

BACKGROUND

Under clause 10.1(a) of the Loan Agreement, the Company

<<<

 is required to make an Amortization Payment of USD 15,000,000 on the Interest Payment Date falling in April 2012 (such Interest Payment Date being 16 April 2012). Failure to make payment of the Amortization Payment on 16 April 2012 will give

<<<

 rise to an Event of Default under clause 15.1(a) of the Loan Agreement. The Company does not currently have sufficient funds available to it to pay this Amortization Payment.

The Company is therefore in discussions with an informal ad hoc

<<<

 committee of Bondholders (the "Committee") and certain other Bondholders which together hold in excess of 66 2A% of the principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, in relation to a possible restructuring of the terms of the Loan.

The Company

<<<

 believes that, subject to appropriate terms being agreed, a restructuring of the terms of the Loan would be beneficial for all stakeholders. Furthermore, whilst there is no certainty that an agreement for such a restructuring can ultimately

<<<

 be reached, the Company believes that, as an interim step, it would be beneficial for all stakeholders to agree to extend the due date of the Amortization Payment due on 16 April 2012 to enable restructuring discussions to take place. The Company

<<<

 therefore seeks an extension of the due date of the next Amortization Payment from 16 April 2012 to 16 May 2012 (the "Extension"), with the other terms of the Loan Agreement remaining unchanged.

In consideration for the Bondholders granting

<<<

 the Extension, the Company shall:

® provide both the Loan Trustee and the Committee with an email update by no later than 12 noon GMT on each Tuesday, up to and including 15 May 2012 (the

"Performance Updates") setting out the operational performance of the FPSO vessels "Rubicon Intrepid" and "Rubicon

 Vantage" over the previous calendar week; and

· execute a cleansing agreement (the "Cleansing Agreement"), in form and substance acceptable to the Committee and its legal counsel, pursuant to which any information provided by or on behalf

<<<

 of the Company to the Committee which may constitute material, non-public and price-sensitive information that would otherwise prevent trading of the Bonds under applicable insider dealing laws or regulations shall be made publicly available

<<<

 on or prior to 16 May 2012.

Failure to comply with either of the above conditions shall entitle the Loan Trustee or any member(s) of the Committee together holding Bonds representing not less than A of the value of the Remaining Loan to terminate

<<<

 the Extension by giving written notice to the Company (the "Termination Notice"). On the Banking Day which falls four clear Banking Days after the date on which the Termination Notice is served (the "New Payment Date"), the Extension will immediately

<<<

 cease to have effect and the Amortization Payment which was due on 16 April 2012 shall be immediately due and payable on the New Payment Date. Failure to make the Amortization payment in full on the New Payment Date shall constitute an Event

<<<

 of Default under the Bonds,

Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printed date. The Bondholder

<<<

's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting, (if the Bonds are held in custody - i.e., the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner

<<<

 of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregated nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorize the Loan Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder

<<<

's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorizing the Loan Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Loan Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the

<<<

 first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclosed with the proxy, as the

<<<

 case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than the Loan

<<<

 Trustee, to notify the Loan Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (as set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
Yours sincerely
