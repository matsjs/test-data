 term is understood pursuant to Article 652a of the Swiss Code of Obligations. We have not applied for a listing of the Exchange Notes on the SWX Swiss Exchange and consequently the information presented in the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation

<<<

 Memorandum does not necessarily comply with the information standards set out in the relevant listing rules. The Exchange Notes may not be publicly offered in Switzerland. The Exchange Notes may be offered only to a selected number of individual

<<<

 investors in Switzerland, under circumstances which will not result in the Exchange Notes being a public offering within the meaning of Article 652a of the Swiss Code of Obligations. Each copy of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation

<<<

 of an offer to sell or buy the Existing Notes and/or Exchange Notes, as applicable, (and offers of Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers will not be accepted from Holders) in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation

<<<

 is unlawful. In those jurisdictions where the securities, blue sky or other laws require the Exchange Offers or the Consent Solicitations to be made by a licensed broker or dealer and either of the Dealer Managers or any of their respective

<<<

 affiliates is such a licensed broker or dealer in any such jurisdiction, that Exchange Offer or Consent Solicitation, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be made by such Dealer Manager or such affiliate (as the case may be) on behalf of

<<<

 the Existing Notes Issuer and/or the Exchange Notes Issuer in such jurisdiction. Each Holder participating in an Exchange Offer or a Consent Solicitation will be deemed to give certain representations in respect of the jurisdictions referred

<<<

 to above and generally as set forth in "Procedures for Participating in the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations". Any offer of Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers from a Holder that is unable to make these

<<<

 representations will not be accepted. Each of the Existing Notes Issuer, the Exchange Notes Issuer, the Dealer Managers and the Exchange and Tabulation Agent reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to investigate, in relation to the

<<<

 offer of Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers, whether any such representation given by a Holder is correct and, if such investigation is undertaken and as a result the Exchange Notes Issuer determines (for any reason

<<<

) that such representation is not correct, such offer shall not be accepted.
