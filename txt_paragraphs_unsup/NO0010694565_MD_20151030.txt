ISIN NO 001 069456.5: 7.75 per cent. World Wide Supply AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2017
PRESS RELEASE
On the 16 September Worldwide Supply AS received notice of termination of two of the four long term

<<<

 contracts with Petrobras following a 3 month "blocking period". The termination is caused by the lack of renewal of the CAA (Certification of Charter Authorisation). The renewal of the CAA for the two ships was "blocked" by a Brazilian-flagged

<<<

 vessel which according to Brazilian law has preferential right to employment. Via the company's Brazilian lawyer Petrobras has been notified that the termination is considered unlawful as the employment has not been conveyed to the Brazilian

<<<

-flagged vessel. The company has also informed Petrobras that they have a contractual obligation to pay hire during the 3 months blocking period, equivalent to approximately USD 4.0 million. The termination of the contracts has caused the company

<<<

 to have only two of the four vessels employed. These two remaining contracts expire in June 2018 based on the renewals of the CAA's in June 2016 and June 2017. The company's liquidity is now reduced to $ 5.6 million as of 30 September 2015

<<<

. The company is thus in breach of the minimum liquidity covenant of USD 7.5 million set out in bondloan agreement with Nordic Trustee. The company's liquidity will remain below the covenant in the loan agreement. On behalf of the Bondholders

<<<

, Nordic Trustee has by letter dated 23 October 2015 given notice that an event of default has occurred under the bondloan agreement. Nordic Trustee is entitled to declare default and terminate the bondloan if the default is not remedied within

<<<

 20 business days within receipt of the notice. The remedy period expires on 20 November 2015. The board and management of the Issuer have assessed the situation and must conclude that the company will not be able to satisfy the full debt service

<<<

 if the depressed market continues. The board and management of the Issuer have therefore submitted an action plan to Nordic Trustee which is representing the company's largest creditor. The action plan contains targeted measures to increase

<<<

 the company's cash flow and reduce debt levels. The measures are aimed at achieving employment for the four ships that are laid-up together with significant cost-cutting measures that together can cater for a lower debt level in a period where

<<<

 two vessels are under contract and four vessels are laid-up. The board and management of the Issuer believe the action plan ensures continued operations. Implementation of the action plan requires the consent of Nordic Trustee.
Yours sincerely
