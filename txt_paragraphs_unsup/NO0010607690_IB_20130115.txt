Consultation paper

<<<

 regarding reduced capital element tariff received

Njord Gas Infrastructure AS (the `Company'), as owner in the Gassled joint venture, today received a consultation paper from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (`MPE') regarding certain proposed

<<<

 changes to the Tariff Regulations (Regulation no. 1724 dated 20. December 2002 - relating to the stipulation of tariffs for certain facilities).

In the consultation paper, the MPE proposes to reduce the capital element (`K') of the Gassled

<<<

 tariff by 90% for a majority of the tariff areas. The proposal is based on tariff reductions being effective only for bookings made from and including the spring of 2013. No changes are proposed for existing bookings. The operational expense

<<<

 element (`O') and the capital investment element (`I') of the tariff will under the proposal remain unchanged.

The proposal is subject to a two month consultation period for stakeholders to respond. Thereafter, the MPE will evaluate responses

<<<

 before deciding whether to implement the new tariff regulation. The proposal contemplates implementation by 1 May 2013. The Board of the Company is concerned about the implications of the proposal for the Gassled owners and the long-term development

<<<

 of the gas transportation infrastructure on the Norwegian continental shelf.

Significant parts of the Gassled system are already booked for several years to come and so, the potential implications for the Company are not substantial in the

<<<

 short to medium term, but will increase over time. However, based on a preliminary analysis of the implications of the proposal, the Company forecasts that it will generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations.

The Company is now

<<<

 thoroughly assessing the implications of the proposal and will respond to the MPE in due course. The Company will continue to inform its investors as appropriate.

Njord Gas Infrastructure AS is headquartered in Stavanger, Norway. It invests

<<<

 in Norwegian gas infrastructure and currently holds an 8.036% participating interest in Gassled. For more information, please refer to http://njordgasinfra.no/.
