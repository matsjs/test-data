RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING AND SALES TO RETAIL INVESTORS The

<<<

 Notes are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors. In some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws, regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale

<<<

 of securities such as the Notes to retail investors. In particular, in August 2014, the UK Financial Conduct Authority published the Temporary Marketing Restriction (Contingent Convertible Securities) Instrument 2014 (as amended or replaced

<<<

 from time to time, the "TMR") which took effect on 1 October 2014. Under the rules set out in the TMR (as amended or replaced from time to time, the "TMR Rules"), certain contingent write-down or convertible securities, such as securities having

<<<

 features substantially similar to the Notes, must not be sold to retail clients in the European Economic Area (the "EEA") and nothing may be done that would or might result in the buying of such securities or the holding of a beneficial interest

<<<

 in such securities by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the TMR Rules), other than in accordance with the limited exemptions set out in the TMR Rules. The Managers are required to comply with the TMR Rules. By purchasing

<<<

, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes from the Issuer and/or any Manager, each prospective investor represents, warrants, agrees with, and undertakes to, the Issuer and the Managers that: 1. it is not a retail client in the

<<<

 EEA (as defined in the TMR Rules); 2. whether or not it is subject to the TMR Rules, it will not sell or offer the Notes to retail clients in the EEA or do
anything (including the distribution of the Prospectus) that would or might result in

<<<

 the buying of the Notes or the holding of a beneficial interest in the Notes by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the TMR Rules), other than (i) in relation to any sale or offer to sell Notes to a retail client

<<<

 in or resident in the United Kingdom (the "UK"), in circumstances that do not and will not give rise to a contravention of the TMR Rules by any person and/or (ii) in relation to any sale or offer to sell Notes to a retail client in any EEA

<<<

 member state other than the UK, where (a) it has conducted an assessment and concluded that the relevant retail client understands the risks of an investment in the Notes and is able to bear the potential losses involved in an investment in

<<<

 the Notes and (b) it has at all times acted in relation to such sale or offer in compliance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) ("MiFID") to the extent it applies to it or, to the extent MiFID does not apply to

<<<

 it, in a manner which would be in compliance with MiFID if it were to apply to it; and 3. it will at all times comply with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside the EEA) relating to the promotion

<<<

, offering, distribution and/or sale of the Notes, including any such laws, regulations and regulatory guidance relating to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in the Notes by investors in any relevant jurisdiction

<<<

. Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed client when purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes from the Issuer and/or any Manager, the foregoing representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings

DNB Bank ASA
(incorporated in Norway)

U.S.$750,000,000 Fixed Rate Reset Perpetual Additional Tier 1 Capital Notes
Issue

<<<

 Price: 100.00 per cent.
The U.S.$750,000,000 Fixed Rate Reset Perpetual Additional Tier 1 Capital Notes (the "Notes") will constitute undated, unsecured and subordinated obligations of DNB Bank ASA (the "Bank" or the "Issuer"), a public limited

<<<

 liability company organised under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway ("Norway"), and will constitute Fondsobligasjoner and will be issued on the Terms and Conditions of the Notes set out herein (the "Conditions", and references to a number Condition

<<<

 shall be construed accordingly).
The Notes will be denominated in U.S. dollars and will bear interest on their outstanding principal amount from time to time from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) 26 March 2020 (the "First Call

<<<

 Date") at a fixed rate of 5.75 per cent. per annum and thereafter at a fixed rate of interest which will be reset on the First Call Date and on each fifth anniversary of the First Call Date thereafter. Interest will be payable annually in arrear

<<<

 on 26 March in each year, commencing on 26 March 2016 (each an "Interest Payment Date"), provided that any payment of interest may be cancelled, in whole or in part, in the sole and full discretion of the Issuer, and shall be cancelled (in

<<<

 whole or in part) in certain circumstances described in Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation) and following the occurrence of a Trigger Event (as further described in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event)). The Financial Supervisory

<<<

 Authority of Norway (Finanstilsynet) (the "Norwegian FSA") may also direct the Bank to exercise its discretion to cancel interest scheduled to be paid on any Interest Payment Date. Interest which has been cancelled in accordance with the Conditions

<<<

 will not accumulate, and holders of the Notes will not at any time be entitled to any such cancelled interest.
If at any time the CET1 Ratio of the Bank, the Bank Group or (subject to Condition 7.10) the DNB Group falls below 5.125 per cent

<<<

., the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes will be Written Down by the Write-Down Amount, as further provided in Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event). The Outstanding Principal Amount may, in the sole discretion of the

<<<

 Bank and subject to certain conditions, be subsequently reinstated (in whole or in part) out of the profits generated by the Bank, the Bank Group or (subject to Condition 7.10) the DNB Group, as further described in Condition 8 (Discretionary

<<<

 Reinstatement o f the Notes).
The principal amount of the Notes may also, in certain circumstances, be written down by the shareholders of the Bank or by the Norwegian authorities pursuant to powers granted to them under Chapter 3 of the Norwegian

<<<

 Bank Security Act of 6 December 1996 No 75, as further described herein.
The Notes will be perpetual with no fixed maturity date. The Bank may, in its sole discretion but subject to the approval of the Norwegian FSA and to compliance with Applicable

<<<

 Banking Regulations, elect to redeem the Notes (in whole but not in part) (i) on the First Call Date or any Interest Payment Date thereafter, provided that any principal amount by which the Notes have been Written Down pursuant to Condition

<<<

 7 has first been reinstated in full pursuant to Condition 8, or (ii) at any time following the occurrence of a Tax Event, a Withholding Tax Event or a Capital Event (each as defined in the Conditions). In any such case, the Notes will be redeemed

<<<

 at their Redemption Amount.
If at any time a Tax Event, a Withholding Tax Event or a Capital Event occurs and is continuing, the Bank may, instead of redeeming the Notes as aforesaid, subject to the approval of the Norwegian FSA and to compliance

<<<

 with Applicable Banking Regulations, elect in its sole discretion either to substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes for, or to vary the terms of the Notes provided that they remain or become, Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Notes (having

<<<

 terms not materially less favourable to a holder than the terms of the Notes, as reasonably determined by the Bank).
Investing in the Notes involves significant risks. Please review carefully the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this Prospectus

<<<

.
This Prospectus has been approved by the Central Bank of Ireland (the "Central Bank"), as competent authority under Directive 2003/71/EC, as amended (the "Prospectus Directive"). The Central Bank only approves this Prospectus as meeting the

<<<

<<<

 be offered to the public in any Member State of the European Economic Area. Application has also been made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to the official list of the Irish Stock Exchange (the "Official List") and to

<<<

 trading on its regulated market (the "Main Securities Market"). The Main Securities Market is a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2004/39/EC.

<<<

1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act ("Regulation

<<<

 S")). For a description of these and certain further restrictions on offers, sales and transfers of the Notes and distribution of this Prospectus, see "Subscription and Sale".
The Notes are not intended to be sold and should not be sold to

<<<

 retail clients in the European Economic Area, as defined in the rules set out in the Temporary Marketing Restriction (Contingent Convertible Securities) Instrument 2014 (as amended or replaced from time to time, the "TMR") other than in circumstances

<<<

 that do not and will not give rise to a contravention of those rules by any person. Prospective investors are referred to the section headed "Restrictions on marketing and sales to retail investors" on page 3 of this Prospectus for further

<<<

 information.
The Notes will be issued in registered form in the denominations of U.S.$200,000 and integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will initially be represented by a global Note certificate (the "Global Certificate

<<<

") which will be deposited on or about the Issue Date with a common depositary and registered in the name of a nominee for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme.

RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETING AND SALES TO RETAIL INVESTORS
The Notes are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate

<<<

 investment for all investors. In some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws, regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the Notes to retail investors.
In particular, in August

<<<

 2014, the UK Financial Conduct Authority published the TMR, which took effect on 1 October 2014. Under the rules set out in the TMR (as amended or replaced from time to time, the "TMR Rules"), certain contingent write-down or convertible securities

<<<

, such as securities having features substantially similar to the Notes, must not be sold to retail clients in the European Economic Area (the "EEA") and nothing may be done that would or might result in the buying of such securities or the

<<<

 holding of a beneficial interest in such securities by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the TMR Rules), other than in accordance with the limited exemptions set out in the TMR Rules.
The Managers are required to

<<<

 comply with the TMR Rules. By purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes from the Issuer and/or any Manager, each prospective investor represents, warrants, agrees with, and undertakes to, the Issuer and the Managers

<<<

 that:
1. it is not a retail client in the EEA (as defined in the TMR Rules);
2. whether or not it is subject to the TMR Rules, it will not sell or offer the Notes to retail clients in the EEA or do anything (including the distribution of the

<<<

 Prospectus) that would or might result in the buying of the Notes or the holding of a beneficial interest in the Notes by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning of the TMR Rules), other than (i) in relation to any sale

<<<

 or offer to sell Notes to a retail client in or resident in the United Kingdom (the "UK"), in circumstances that do not and will not give rise to a contravention of the TMR Rules by any person and/or (ii) in relation to any sale or offer to

<<<

 sell Notes to a retail client in any EEA member state other than the UK, where (a) it has conducted an assessment and concluded that the relevant retail client understands the risks of an investment in the Notes and is able to bear the potential

<<<

 losses involved in an investment in the Notes and (b) it has at all times acted in relation to such sale or offer in compliance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) ("MiFID") to the extent it applies to it or, to

<<<

 the extent MiFID does not apply to it, in a manner which would be in compliance with MiFID if it were to apply to it; and
3. it will at all times comply with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside

<<<

 the EEA) relating to the promotion, offering, distribution and/or sale of the Notes, including any such laws, regulations and regulatory guidance relating to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in the Notes by

<<<

 investors in any relevant jurisdiction.
Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed client when purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes from the Issuer and/or any Manager, the foregoing representations

<<<

, warranties, agreements and undertakings will be given by and be binding upon both the agent and its underlying client.

The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors. Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability

<<<

 of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor may wish to consider, either on its own or with the help of its financial and other professional advisers, whether it:

(i)

has sufficient knowledge

<<<

 and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and

risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this

Prospectus or any applicable supplement;

3

(ii) has access to

<<<

, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) understands thoroughly

<<<

 the terms of the Notes and is familiar with the behaviour of financial markets;
(iv) has sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where U.S. dollars (the currency for principal

<<<

 and interest payments) is different from the potential investor's currency; and
(v) is able to evaluate possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks

<<<

.
Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments. The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor

<<<

 should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (1) Notes are legal investments for it, (2) Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge

<<<

 of any Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.
The Notes may be considered by

<<<

 eligible investors who are in a position to give the above representations, warranties and undertakings and to be able to satisfy themselves that the Notes would constitute an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their overall

<<<

 portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless it has the expertise (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the

<<<

 value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment portfolio.
Websites In this Prospectus, references to websites or uniform resource locators ("URLs") are inactive textual references

<<<

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements, which reflect the current expectation of the DNB Group's management with respect to future events, financial and operating

<<<

 performance and future market conditions. Words such as "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "aim", "project", "expect", "intend", "predict", "target", "may", "might", "assume", "could", "will" and "should" or other variations or comparable terminology

<<<

 are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements appear in a number of places in this Prospectus including, without limitation, the documents referred to in "Documents Incorporated by Reference", "Risk Factors

<<<

" and "Description o f the Issuer and the DNB Group". These forward-looking statements address matters such as:

·

the DNB Group's and the Bank's business strategy and financial targets;

·

performance of the financial markets;

·

future

<<<

 prospects of the DNB Group and the Bank such as growth prospects, cost development under the

cost programme and future write-downs on loans; and

·

future exposure to credit, market, liquidity and other risks.

By their nature, forward-looking

<<<

 statements involve risk and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. While the Bank has prepared these forward looking statements in good faith and on the basis of assumptions

<<<

 it believes to be reasonable, any such forward looking statements are not guarantees or warranties of future performance. The Bank's and/or the DNB Group's actual financial condition, results of operation and cash flows, and the development

<<<

 of the markets in which it operates, may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this Prospectus.

In connection with the issue of the Notes, Goldman Sachs

<<<

 International acting as the Stabilisation Manager (the "Stabilisation Manager") or any person acting on its behalf may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that

<<<

 which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilisation Manager (or any person acting on behalf of the Stabilisation Manager) will undertake stabilisation action. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the

<<<

 date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the relevant Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after

<<<

 the date of the allotment of the Notes. Any stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the Stabilisation Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.

RISK FACTORS
In purchasing

<<<

 Notes, investors assume the risk that the Issuer may become insolvent or otherwise be unable to make all payments due in respect of the Notes. There is a wide range of factors which individually or together could result in the Issuer becoming

<<<

 unable to make all payments due in respect of the Notes. It is not possible to identify all such factors or to determine which factors are most likely to occur, as the Issuer may not be aware o f all relevant factors and certain factors which

<<<

 it currently deems not to be material may become material as a result o f the occurrence o f events outside the Issuer's control. The Issuer has identified in this Prospectus a number o ffactors which could materially adversely affect its business

<<<

 and ability to make payments due under the Notes. All o f these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring.
In addition, factors

<<<

 which the Issuer believes may be material fo r the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are described below.
The Issuer believes that thefactors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing

<<<

 in the Notes, but the Issuer may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on information currently available

<<<

 to it and which it may not currently be able to anticipate. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus, including the information incorporated by reference herein, and reach their own

<<<

 views prior to making any investment decision.
Capitalised terms used and not otherwise defined in this section have the meanings given to such terms in "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes " or on page 4 o f this Prospectus.
FACTORS THAT MAY

<<<

 AFFECT THE ISSUER'S ABILITY TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NOTES
Economic activity in Norway
The Issuer's business activities are dependent on the level of banking, finance and financial services required by its customers. In particular

<<<

, levels of borrowing are heavily dependent on customer confidence, employment trends, the state of the economy and market interest rates at the time. As the Issuer currently conducts the majority of its business in Norway, its performance is

<<<

 influenced by the level and cyclical nature of business activity in Norway, which is in turn affected by both domestic and international economic factors (for example, fluctuations in the price of oil and gas) and political events. In particular

<<<

, lower oil prices and greater uncertainty regarding the Norwegian economy towards the end of 2014 resulted in a depreciation of the Norwegian krone, reduced prices on Norwegian Treasury bills and widening credit spreads with a consequent negative

<<<

 effect on the income of the DNB Group. There can be no assurance that future deteriorations in the economy of Norway will not have an adverse effect on the future results of the Issuer or the DNB Group.
Risks relating to disruptions in the

<<<

 global credit markets and economy
Financial markets are subject to periods of historic volatility which may impact the Issuer's ability to raise debt in a similar manner, and at a similar cost, to the funding raised in the past. Challenging

<<<

 market conditions have resulted in greater volatility but also in reduced liquidity, widening of credit spreads and lack of price transparency in credit markets. Changes in investment markets, including changes in interest rates, exchange rates

<<<

 and returns from equity, property and other investments, may affect the financial performance of the Issuer. In addition, the financial performance of the Issuer could be adversely affected by a worsening of general economic conditions in the

<<<

 markets in which it operates.
Business risk factors
As a result of its business activities, the Issuer is exposed to a variety of risks, the most significant of which are credit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. Failure

<<<

 to control these risks could result in adverse effects on the Issuer's financial performance and reputation.
7

Credit risk
Risks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties are

<<<

 inherent in a wide range of the Issuer's businesses. Adverse changes in the credit quality of the Issuer's borrowers and counterparties or a general deterioration in Norwegian or global economic conditions, or arising from systematic risks

<<<

 in the financial systems, could affect the recoverability and value of the Issuer's assets and require an increase in the Issuer's provision for bad and doubtful debts and other provisions. In particular, a combination of increasing household

<<<

 indebtedness and stable or declining housing prices in Norway could increase the financial vulnerability of some Norwegian mortgage borrowers, especially young and/or low-income borrowers. Norwegian customers have historically demonstrated

<<<

 a preference for floating rate mortgages and increases in interest rates could weaken the liquidity situation of certain borrowers. An increase in household indebtedness, a decline in house prices or an increase in interest rates could have

<<<

 an adverse effect on mortgage borrowers' ability to meet their mortgage obligations and could adversely affect the Issuer's results of operations, financial condition and business prospects and its ability to perform its obligations under the

<<<

 Notes.
Market risk
The most significant market risks the Issuer faces are interest rate, foreign exchange and bond and equity price risks. Changes in interest rate levels, yield curves and spreads may affect the interest rate margin realised

<<<

 between lending and borrowing costs. Changes in currency rates, particularly in the Norwegian krone-U.S. dollar and Norwegian krone-euro exchange rates, affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and may affect

<<<

 income from foreign exchange dealing. The performance of financial markets may cause changes in the value of the Issuer's investment and trading portfolios. The Issuer has implemented risk management methods to mitigate and control these and

<<<

 other market risks to which the Issuer is exposed, and exposures are constantly measured and monitored. However, it is difficult to predict changes in economic or market conditions and to anticipate the effects that such changes could have

<<<

 on the Issuer's financial performance and business operations.
Operational risk
The Issuer's businesses are dependent on its ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risk and losses can

<<<

 result from fraud, errors by employees, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorisation, failure to comply with regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules, equipment failures, natural disasters

<<<

 or the failure of external systems, for example, those of the Issuer's suppliers or counterparties. Although the Issuer has implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient

<<<

 procedures and to staff training, it is not possible to implement procedures which are fully effective in controlling each of the operational risks.
Liquidity risk
The inability of the Issuer to anticipate and provide for unforeseen decreases

<<<

 or changes in funding sources could have adverse consequences on the Issuer's ability to meet its obligations when they fall due.
Credit ratings
The Issuer's credit ratings are important to its business. There can be no assurance that the rating

<<<

 agencies will not downgrade the ratings of the Issuer or the ratings of the Issuer's debt instruments (including Notes issued under this Prospectus) either as a result of the financial position of the DNB Group or changes to applicable rating

<<<

 methodologies used by S&P, Moody's, DBRS and any other relevant rating agency. A rating agency's evaluation of the Issuer may also be based on a number of factors not entirely within the control of the Issuer, such as conditions affecting the

<<<

 financial services industry generally. Any reduction in the Issuer's credit ratings or the ratings of its debt instruments, including any unsolicited credit rating, could adversely affect its liquidity and competitive position, undermine confidence

<<<

 in the Issuer and the DNB Group, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets, or limit the range of counterparties willing to enter into transactions with the Issuer and the DNB Group. Such development could have a

<<<

 material adverse effect on the Issuer and the DNB Group's business, financial situation, results of operations, liquidity and/or prospects.
Impact o f regulatory changes
Each of the Issuer and the DNB Group are subject to financial services

<<<

 laws, regulations, administrative actions and policies in Norway and in each other jurisdiction in which the Issuer and the DNB Group, respectively carries
8

on business. Changes in supervision and regulation, in particular in Norway, could

<<<

 materially affect the Issuer's and the DNB Group's business, the products and services offered or the value of its assets. Although the Issuer and the DNB Group works closely with its regulators and continually monitors the situation, future

<<<

 changes in regulation, fiscal or other policies can be unpredictable and are beyond the control of the Issuer and the DNB Group.
EU bank recovery and resolution directive
On 2 July 2014, Directive 2014/59/EU providing for the establishment

<<<

 of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the "Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive" or "BRRD") entered into force. The BRRD is designed to provide authorities with a credible set

<<<

 of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in an unsound or failing institution so as to ensure the continuity of the institution's critical financial and economic functions, while minimising the impact of an institution's failure

<<<

 on the economy and financial system.
The BRRD, under its terms, was required to be applied by European Union Member States from 1 January 2015, except for the general bail-in tool (see below) which is to be applied from 1 January 2016. It should

<<<

 be noted that Norway will not be directly bound by the BRRD before it has been implemented into the EEA Agreement and even if Norway is seeking to adopt EU directives and regulations prior to their implementation in the EEA Agreement, no draft

<<<

 regulations have been suggested in Norway at present. It should also be noted that some of the provisions of the BRRD relating to the supranational powers of the European Banking Authority appear to conflict with the Norwegian constitution

<<<

, and that implementation will therefore require a three-quarters majority of the Norwegian Parliament. Even though the Ministers of Finance in the EEA member states reached agreement with the European Union Member States on 14 October 2014

<<<

 on the principles of how the supranational powers of the European Banking Authority shall be implemented in the EEA, this agreement is subject to the approval of the Norwegian Parliament. At present it is not clear when, or in what form, this

<<<

 matter will be presented to the Norwegian Parliament for approval. With respect to Norwegian rules in force regarding loss absorption, please see "The Notes may also be written down by the B ank's shareholders or the Norwegian authorities under

<<<

 the Norwegian Bank Security Act" below.
The BRRD contains four resolution tools and powers which may be used alone or in combination where the relevant resolution authority considers that (a) an institution is failing or likely to fail, (b

<<<

) there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures would prevent the failure of such institution within a reasonable timeframe, and (c) a resolution action is in the public interest: (i) sale of business - which enables

<<<

 resolution authorities to direct the sale of the firm or the whole or part of its business on commercial terms; (ii) bridge institution - which enables resolution authorities to transfer all or part of the business of the firm to a "bridge

<<<

 institution" (an entity created for this purpose that is wholly or partially in public control); (iii) asset separation - which enables resolution authorities to transfer impaired or problem assets to one or more publicly owned asset management

<<<

 vehicles to allow them to be managed with a view to maximising their value through eventual sale or orderly wind-down (this can be used together with another resolution tool only); and (iv) bail-in which gives resolution authorities the power

<<<

 to write down certain claims of unsecured creditors of a failing institution and to convert certain unsecured debt claims, which would include the Notes, to equity (the "general bail-in tool"), with such equity also being subject to any future

<<<

 application of the general bail-in tool.
The BRRD also provides for a Member State, in the event that the above resolution tools alone are insufficient to maintain financial stability, to be able to provide extraordinary public financial support

<<<

 through additional financial stabilisation tools. These consist of the public equity support and temporary public ownership tools. Any such extraordinary financial support must be provided in accordance with the EU state aid framework.
An institution

<<<

 will be considered as failing or likely to fail when: it is, or is likely in the near future to be, in breach of its requirements for continuing authorisation; its assets are, or are likely in the near future to be, less than its liabilities

<<<

; it is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or it requires extraordinary public financial support (except in limited circumstances).
In addition to the general bail-in tool, the BRRD provides for

<<<

 resolution authorities to have the further power to permanently write-down or convert into equity capital instruments such as the Notes at the point of non-viability
9

and before any other resolution action is taken (non-viability loss absorption

<<<

). Any shares issued to holders of the Notes upon any such conversion into equity may also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool.

For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point

<<<

 of non-viability under the BRRD is the point at which the relevant authority determines that the institution meets the conditions for resolution (but no resolution action has yet been taken) or that the institution will no longer be viable

<<<

 unless the relevant capital instruments (such as the Notes) are written-down or converted or extraordinary public support is to be provided and without such support the appropriate authority determines that the institution would no longer be

<<<

 viable.

The powers set out in the BRRD will impact how relevant credit institutions and investment firms are managed as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors.

It is currently unclear whether the BRRD will be implemented

<<<

 in Norway, and any such implementation may require appropriate consideration of applicable constitutional issues. Presently, the Notes will be subject to the Bank Security Act described below.
If the BRRD were to be implemented in Norway, Additional

<<<

 Tier 1 instruments such as the Notes may be expected to be within the scope of both the general bail-in tool and the power to permanently write-down or convert into equity capital instruments at the point of non-viability and before any other

<<<

 resolution action is taken, in each case as described above.
If the BRRD is implemented in Norway in line with the EU legislation, holders of Notes may be subject to write down or conversion into equity on any application of the general bail

<<<

-in tool or the non-viability loss absorption powers, which may result in such holders losing some or all of their investment in the Notes, or their rights in respect of the Notes and/or the value of their investment may otherwise be materially

<<<

 adversely affected.
In addition, the market price of the Notes could be adversely affected by the implementation or proposed implementation of BRRD in Norway and/or, following any such implementation, by any actual or anticipated use of the

<<<

 powers thereunder in respect of the Bank and/or the Notes. Any action taken under such legislation in respect of the Issuer or the DNB Group could also affect the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.
As it remains

<<<

 uncertain whether (and, if so, when) the BRRD will be implemented in Norway, and in any event the Norwegian authorities could elect to adopt more onerous provisions than required under the EU legislation, it is difficult to anticipate the potential

<<<

 implications for the Bank or the Notes.

The Notes may also be written down by the Bank's shareholders or the Norwegian authorities under the Norwegian Bank Security Act

The Notes may also be written down by the shareholders of the Bank or

<<<

 by the Norwegian authorities pursuant to powers granted to them under Chapter 3 of the Norwegian Bank Security Act of 6 December 1996 No 75 (Lov om sikringsordninger fo r banker, forsikringsselskapenes garantiordninger og offentlig administrasjon

<<<

 m.v. av finansinstitusjoner) (the "Bank Security Act").

Pursuant to section 3-6 of the Bank Security Act, if:

(a) the Bank's most recent audited accounts reveal that its net assets are less than 25 per cent. of its share capital (for the

<<<

 avoidance of doubt, this ratio is measured against issued share capital and not the total equity of the Bank); or

(b) a substantial part of the Subordinated Loan Capital (as defined below) of the Bank is lost,

the general meeting of shareholders

<<<

 of the Bank, failing which the relevant Norwegian authorities, can:

(i)

firstly, cancel share capital to compensate for the shortfall; and

10

(ii) secondly, if any remaining shortfall exceeds a substantial part (as determined by the general

<<<

 meeting of shareholders of the Bank or by the relevant Norwegian authorities) of the Bank's subordinated loan capital, cancel, in whole or in part, such subordinated loan capital ("Subordinated Loan Capital") (which would include principal

<<<

 in respect of the Notes).
Any instruments written down and/or cancelled pursuant to the Bank Security Act will not be reinstated in whole or in part at any time. Accordingly, if the principal amount of the Notes were to be written down pursuant

<<<

 to the Bank Security Act, then there will be no Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes under the Conditions in respect of that part of the principal which has been so written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act.
The write down of the Notes

<<<

 under the Bank Security Act will affect the claims of the Holders in various respects. Firstly, in the event of a winding-up of the Issuer, the claims of the Holders will be in respect of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes at the

<<<

 time of the winding-up of the Issuer, and not for the Original Principal Amount. Similarly, upon any redemption of the Notes by the Issuer, whether at its option pursuant to Condition 9.2 or following the occurrence of a Capital Event, a Tax

<<<

 Event or a Withholding Tax Event, the redemption amount of each Note will be its Outstanding Principal Amount (together with accrued and unpaid interest) and not its Original Principal Amount. Whilst the Issuer is not entitled to exercise its

<<<

 optional redemption right pursuant to Condition 9.2 until any principal amount by which the Notes have been Written Down pursuant to Condition 7 has first been reinstated in full pursuant to Condition 8, the Issuer is not able to reinstate

<<<

 any principal amount of the Notes which has been written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act and, accordingly, the Issuer would be entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to Condition 9.2 (subject to compliance with the conditions to such

<<<

 redemption) notwithstanding that the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes is less than their Original Principal Amount by virtue of such write-down under the Bank Security Act.
In addition, interest will accrue only on the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amount of the Notes from time to time, and accordingly for so long as the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes is less than their Original Principal Amount, the maximum amount of interest which may be paid by the Issuer (subject

<<<

 always to cancellation as provided in the Conditions) on any Interest Payment Date shall be less than if the Notes had not been written down.
The circumstances in which the Notes may be written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act are not

<<<

 identical to the circumstances in which a Write Down will occur following a Trigger Event. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, it is expected that a Trigger Event would occur before the circumstances in which the Notes may be written

<<<

 down pursuant to the Bank Security Act, in which case the Notes will be Written Down pursuant to the Conditions of the Notes. However, it is possible that both a Trigger Event and the events enabling a write-down under the Bank Security Act

<<<

 could occur at or around the same time, and in such circumstances the interaction between the Write Down provisions of the Conditions and the write-down of the Notes under the Bank Security Act is not entirely clear. It is however, under such

<<<

 circumstances, likely that the Norwegian FSA may determine that the Notes will be written down under the Bank Security Act. In addition, in such circumstances, if the Norwegian FSA informs the Bank that any Subordinated Loan Capital which are

<<<

 not Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments or Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments should nevertheless be treated effectively as if they were Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments or Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments for the purposes of determining the amount

<<<

 by which the Notes are required to be Written Down, then such Subordinated Loan Capital shall be so treated for the purposes of calculation of the Write Down Amount.
Holders will not be entitled to any compensation or other payment as a result

<<<

 of any write down of the Notes pursuant to the Bank Security Act. Accordingly, if the Notes are written down under the Bank Security Act, Holders could lose all or part of the value of their investment in the Notes. In addition, any actual

<<<

 or anticipated use of the powers under the Bank Security Act to write down the Notes will be likely to have a severe adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.
CRD IV - capital requirements
The directive of the European Parliament and

<<<

 of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms dated 26 June 2013 and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 27 June 2013, together with the associated regulation 575/2013 of the European

<<<

 Parliament and of the Council of 26 June
11

2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, in each case as amended or replaced from time to time ("CRD IV") provides for the new, stricter capital requirements

<<<

, and on 14 June 2013 the Norwegian Government sanctioned an act which implemented the capital adequacy rules of CRD IV. Implementation of the rules was effected by making amendments to the Norwegian Financial Institutions Act ("FIA") which

<<<

 came into force on 1 July 2013 and imply a gradual increase in capital adequacy requirements over the coming years.
The new and amended provisions of the FIA require that the capital adequacy requirement of 8 per cent. shall consist of at least

<<<

 4.5 per cent. common equity tier 1 capital and at least 6 per cent. tier 1 capital.
In addition to the requirement for 4.5 per cent. common equity tier 1 capital, FIA imposes various capital buffer requirements which must be met by Norwegian

<<<

 financial institutions, all consisting of common equity tier 1. The capital buffer requirements consist of (i) a conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent. and (ii) a systemic risk buffer of 3 per cent. From 1 July 2014, the Issuer was required to

<<<

 hold a total of 10 per cent. common equity in addition to the 3.5 per cent. of other capital instruments.
From 30 June 2015, banks will also have to comply with a counter-cyclical buffer and a capital buffer to mitigate systemic risk. The counter

<<<

-cyclical buffer is currently set at 1 per cent., but the level will be determined by the Ministry of Finance each quarter. A decision to increase the level will normally enter into force no earlier than 12 months after the decision was made

<<<

. On 19 December 2014 the Ministry of Finance announced that the requirement shall remain at 1 per cent., whilst the Norwegian FSA expressed the view that the requirement ought to be increased to 1.5 per cent. from 31 December 2015 (although

<<<

 no decision to this effect has been taken).
In addition, systemically important banks must hold a buffer for systemically important institutions of 1 per cent. of common equity tier 1 from 1 July 2015. The Norwegian Ministry adopted regulation

<<<

 on the identification of systemically important institutions on 12 May 2014 and notified, amongst others, the Issuer that it has been decided that the Issuer is regarded by the Ministry of Finance to be one of the systemically important institutions

<<<

 to which the additional buffer will apply. This means that the Issuer must hold at least a total of 12 per cent. common equity tier 1 capital from 1 July 2015. It has been decided that the additional buffer for systemically important institutions

<<<

, including the Issuer, will increase to 2 per cent. from 1 July 2016.
Effective from 30 September 2014, the Norwegian Government amended the requirements for each of the different types of capital, namely common equity tier 1 (egenkapital)

<<<

, additional tier 1 (hybridkapital) and Tier 2 capital (tilleggskapital), in line with the definitions set out in CRD IV.
The condition of the DNB Group's businesses as well as external conditions are constantly changing. As a result and to

<<<

 ensure compliance with the changing regulatory landscape, they may need to raise additional capital in the future. Such capital, whether in the form of debt financing, hybrid capital or additional equity, may not be available on attractive

<<<

 terms, or at all. In addition, it is difficult to predict what regulatory requirements may be imposed in the future or accurately estimate the impact that any currently proposed regulatory changes may have on the business, the products and

<<<

 services offered by DNB Group entities and the values of their assets. For example, if a member of the DNB Group is required to make additional provisions, increase its reserves or capital, or exit or change its approach to certain businesses

<<<

 as a result of the initiatives to strengthen the regulation of credit institutions, this could adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.
Capital, including the Notes, raised or issued by the Bank will notfully count

<<<

 towards the capital requirements o f the DNB Group
Capital, including the Notes, raised or issued at the Bank level will be recognised at the DNB Group level in accordance with the principle set out in Forskrift om endring av forskrift om anvendelse

<<<

 av soliditetsregler pa konsolidert basis mv., §4a. As a result of compliance with this principle, the full principal amount of capital raised at the Bank level may not be recognised at the DNB Group level. For further information regarding

<<<

 the current regulatory capital ratios of the Bank and the DNB Group, see "Description o f the Issuer and the DNB Group - Regulatory Capital Ratios".
12

RISKS RELATED TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE NOTES
The obligations o f the Issuer in respect

<<<

 o f the Notes are unsecured and deeply subordinated
The Notes constitute unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer.
On a liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of the Issuer by way of public administration (referred to herein

<<<

 as a "winding-up of the Issuer"), all claims in respect of the Notes will rank junior to the claims of all Senior Creditors of the Issuer and pari passu with claims in respect of any Parity Securities. If, on a winding-up of the Issuer, the

<<<

 assets of the Issuer are insufficient to enable the Issuer to repay the claims of more senior-ranking creditors in full, the Holders will lose their entire investment in the Notes. If there are sufficient assets to enable the Issuer to pay

<<<

 the claims of senior-ranking creditors in full but insufficient assets to enable it to pay claims in respect of its obligations in respect of the Notes and all other claims that rank pari passu with the Notes, Holders will lose some (which

<<<

 may be substantially all) of their investment in the Notes.
There is no restriction on the amount of securities or other liabilities that the Issuer may issue, incur or guarantee and which rank senior to, or pari passu with, the Notes. The

<<<

 issue or guaranteeing of any such securities or the incurrence of any such other liabilities may reduce the amount (if any) recoverable by Holders during a windingup of the Issuer and may limit the Issuer's ability to meet its obligations under

<<<

 the Notes.
In addition, as further described below under "Upon the occurrence o f a Trigger Event, the principal amount o f the Notes will be Written Down", the principal amount of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be Written Down,

<<<

 which may be in part or (save for the one cent floor) in whole and may occur on one or more occasions. In a winding-up of the Issuer, the claims of Holders in respect of their Notes will be for the Outstanding Principal Amount at the time of

<<<

 the winding-up of the Issuer, which may be less than the Original Principal Amount of the Notes. The Notes do not contain any restriction on the Issuer's ability to issue securities that may have rights similar but preferential to those of

<<<

 the Notes including securities having more favourable, or no, provisions similar to the Trigger Event applicable to the Notes.
Although the Notes have the potential (subject always to the Issuer's right to cancel interest payments) to pay a

<<<

 higher rate of interest than securities which are not subordinated, there is a substantial risk that investors in the Notes will lose all or some of the value of their investment should a winding-up of the Issuer occur.
The Issuer may at any

<<<

 time elect, and in certain circumstances shall be required, not to make interestpayments on the Notes
The Issuer may at any time elect, in its full and sole discretion, to cancel any interest payment (in whole or in part) on the Notes which

<<<

 would otherwise be due on any Interest Payment Date. Additionally, the Norwegian FSA has the power to direct the Issuer to exercise its discretion to cancel any interest payment (in whole or in part) on the Notes.
Furthermore, the Issuer will

<<<

 cancel any interest payment (in whole or in part) which would otherwise fall due on an Interest Payment Date if and to the extent that payment of such payment of interest would: (i) when aggregated with other relevant stipulated payments or

<<<

 distributions, exceed the Distributable Items of the Issuer; or (ii) when aggregated with other relevant distributions, cause any Maximum Distributable Amount then applicable to the Bank, the Bank Group or (unless no longer required by the

<<<

 Norwegian FSA, as further described below) the DNB Group to be exceeded.
In addition, if a Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer will cancel all interest accrued up to (and including) the Write Down Date.
With respect to cancellation of interest

<<<

 due to insufficient Distributable Items, see also "The level o f the Issuer's Distributable Items is affected by a number o ffactors and insufficient Distributable Items will restrict the ability o f the Issuer to make interest payments on

<<<

 the Notes" below. With respect to cancellation of interest due to the application of a Maximum Distributable Amount, see also "Payments on the Notes will be subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount introduced under the CRR/CRDIVregulations

<<<

 o f 22 August 2014" below.
13

Any interest which is cancelled as a result of optional or mandatory cancellation as described above shall not accumulate and shall no longer be due and payable by the Issuer. A cancellation of interest in accordance

<<<

 with the Conditions will not constitute a default of the Issuer under the Notes for any purpose, and Holders will have no right to such cancelled interest, or any amount in respect thereof, at any time (including in a winding-up of the Issuer

<<<

).
If the Issuer elects to cancel, or is prohibited from paying, interest on the Notes at any time, there is no restriction under the terms of the Notes on the Issuer from otherwise paying dividends, interest or other distributions on, or redeeming

<<<

 or repurchasing, any of its other liabilities (including liabilities which rank pari passu with, or junior to, the Notes) or any of its share capital. In proposing the interim or final distributions (if any) to be declared in respect of the

<<<

 ordinary shares of the Issuer in respect of any given financial year, the Issuer will have regard to all relevant factors which it considers to be appropriate, including the profitability of the Issuer, its resources available for distribution

<<<

 and the capital and liquidity position of the Issuer at the time of proposing the distribution for approval by the shareholders of the Issuer. The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes are senior in ranking to the ordinary shares of the

<<<

 Issuer. It is the Issuer's current intention that, whenever exercising its discretion to propose any dividend in respect of the ordinary shares, or its discretion to cancel interest on the Notes, the Issuer will take into account the relative

<<<

 ranking of these instruments in its capital structure. However, the Issuer may at any time depart from this policy at its sole discretion.
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest on the Notes will likely have an adverse effect on

<<<

 the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation provisions of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that

<<<

 are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer's financial condition. Any indication that the CET1 Ratio of the Bank, the Bank Group or the DNB Group is trending towards a failure to

<<<

 meet fully the combined capital buffer requirement (the level at which the Maximum Distributable Amount restriction becomes relevant) may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.
Notwithstanding the above, if at any time the

<<<

 Bank notifies Holders pursuant to Condition 7.10 that it is no longer required by the Norwegian FSA to treat the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group falling below 5.125 per cent. as a Trigger Event, only a maximum distributable amount applicable to

<<<

 the Bank or the Bank Group will have a direct impact on the Bank's ability to make interest payments on the Notes. However, in such circumstances, whilst any maximum distributable amount applicable to the DNB Group as a result of its failure

<<<

 to comply fully with the DNB Group's combined buffer requirement at any time would not, of itself, result in mandatory restrictions on payments under the Notes, the Issuer expects the Norwegian FSA to continue to have regard to the overall

<<<

 capital strength of the DNB Group in assessing whether to exercise its powers of intervention in respect of the DNB Group or the Bank (which could include, for example, instructing the Bank to exercise its discretion to cancel interest payments

<<<

 in respect of the Notes in whole or in part). Accordingly, any indication that the common equity tier 1 ratio of the DNB Group is trending towards a failure to meet fully the combined capital buffer requirement may continue to have an adverse

<<<

 effect on the market price of the Notes.
The level o f the Issuer's Distributable Items is affected by a number offactors and insufficient Distributable Items will restrict the ability o f the Issuer to make interestpayments on the Notes
The

<<<

 Issuer will cancel any payment of interest amount (in whole or in part) which would otherwise fall due on an Interest Payment Date if and to the extent that payment of such interest would, when aggregated with other relevant stipulated payments

<<<

 or distributions, exceed the Distributable Items of the Issuer.
The level of the Issuer's Distributable Items is affected by a number of factors. The Issuer's future Distributable Items, and therefore the ability of the Issuer to make interest

<<<

 payments under the Notes, are a function of the Issuer's existing Distributable Items and its future profitability. In addition, the Issuer's Distributable Items may also be adversely affected by the servicing of more senior instruments or

<<<

 parity ranking instruments.
The level of the Issuer's Distributable Items may be affected by changes to accounting rules, regulation or the requirements and expectations of applicable regulatory authorities. Any such potential changes could

<<<

 adversely affect the Issuer's Distributable Items in the future.
14

The Issuer's Distributable Items, and therefore the Issuer's ability to make interest payments under the Notes, may be adversely affected by the performance of the business

<<<

 of the Bank Group in general, factors affecting its financial position (including capital and leverage), the economic environment in which the Bank Group operates and other factors outside of the Issuer's control. In addition, adjustments to

<<<

 earnings, as determined by the Board, may fluctuate significantly and may materially adversely affect Distributable Items.
Payments on the Notes will be subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount introduced under the CRR/CRD IV regulations

<<<

 o f 22 August 2014
In circumstances where section 6 of the CRR/CRD IV regulations of 22 August 2014 (forskrift om kapitalkrav og nasjonal tilpasning av CRR/CRD IV) (the "August 2014 Regulations") applies, no payments (or deemed payments) will

<<<

 be made on the Notes (whether by way of principal, interest, Discretionary Reinstatement or otherwise) if and to the extent that such payment would, when aggregated together with other distributions of the kind referred to in section 6(2) of

<<<

 the August 2014 Regulations, cause the Maximum Distributable Amount (if any), determined in accordance with section 6(3) of the August 2014 Regulations then applicable to any of the Issuer, the Bank Group or (subject as provided below) the

<<<

 DNB Group to be exceeded.
Under Applicable Banking Regulations, the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group are required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital equal to 8 per cent. of their respective risk-weighted assets, of which at

<<<

 least 6 per cent. must consist of tier 1 capital and at least 4.5 per cent. must consist of common equity tier 1 capital. In addition to these so-called "own funds" requirements, supervisors may add extra capital to cover other risks (thereby

<<<

 increasing the regulatory minimum required under Applicable Banking Regulations) and the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group may also decide to hold an additional amount of capital. Applicable Banking Regulations also introduced capital

<<<

 buffer requirements that are in addition to the minimum capital requirement and required to be met with common equity tier 1 capital, including a capital conservation buffer, a counter-cyclical buffer, a systemic risk buffer and a buffer for

<<<

 systematically important institutions, such as the Bank. Some or all of these buffers may be applicable to the Bank, the Bank Group and/or (subject as provided below) the DNB Group as determined by the Norwegian FSA.
Under the August 2014 Regulations

<<<

, institutions which fail to fully meet their combined buffer requirement will be subject to restricted "discretionary payments", including payments relating to common equity tier 1 and additional tier 1 instruments and variable remuneration

<<<

 to staff. The restrictions will be scaled according to the extent of the breach of the combined buffer requirement and calculated as a percentage of the profits of the relevant institution since the last distribution of profits or other relevant

<<<

 "discretionary payment". Such calculation will result in a "maximum distributable amount" in each relevant period. As an example, the scaling is such that in the bottom quartile of the "combined buffer requirement", no "discretionary distributions

<<<

" will be permitted to be paid. As a consequence, in the event of breach of the combined buffer requirement by the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group, it may be necessary to reduce discretionary payments, including potentially cancelling

<<<

 (in whole or in part) interest payments in respect of the Notes.
Notwithstanding the above, if at any time the Bank notifies Holders pursuant to Condition 7.10 that it is no longer required by the Norwegian FSA to treat the CET1 Ratio of the

<<<

 DNB Group falling below 5.125 per cent. as a Trigger Event, only a maximum distributable amount applicable to the Bank or the Bank Group will have a direct impact on the Bank's ability to make interest payments on the Notes. However, in such

<<<

 circumstances, whilst any maximum distributable amount applicable to the DNB Group as a result o f its failure to comply fully with the DNB Group's combined buffer requirement at any time would not, o f itself, result in mandatory restrictions

<<<

 on payments under the Notes, the Issuer expects the Norwegian FSA to continue to have regard to the overall capital strength o f the DNB Group in assessing whether to exercise its powers of intervention in respect of the DNB Group or the Bank

<<<

 (which could include, for example, instructing the Bank to exercise its discretion to cancel interest payments in respect o f the Notes).
Each of the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group currently intend to maintain an internal management

<<<

 buffer comprising common equity tier 1 capital over the combined buffer requirement. There can be no assurance, however, that the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group will continue to maintain such internal management
15

buffers or that

<<<

 any such buffers would be sufficient to protect against a breach of the combined buffer requirement, potentially resulting in restrictions on payments on the Notes.
The requirements are calculated by reference to a number of factors any one

<<<

 of which, or combination of which, may not be easily observable or capable of calculation by investors. Further, the Norwegian FSA may raise the capital requirement of the Issuer to cover other risks without such information being disclosed

<<<

 to the public. Accordingly, investors in the Notes may not be able to assess or predict accurately the proximity of the risk of interest payments not being made.
The Notes may be traded with accrued interest, but (i) under certain circumstances

<<<

 described above, such interest will be cancelled and not paid on the relevant Interest Payment Date and (ii) the Issuer retains fu ll discretion to cancel interest otherwise scheduled to be paid on the relevant Interest Payment Date
The Notes

<<<

 may trade, and/or the prices for the Notes may appear, in any trading systems and/or on any stock exchange on which the Notes are for the time being quoted, with accrued interest. If this occurs, purchasers of Notes in the secondary market

<<<

 will pay a price that reflects such accrued interest upon purchase of the Notes. However, if a payment of interest on any Interest Payment Date is cancelled (in whole or in part) as described herein and thus is not due and payable, purchasers

<<<

 of such Notes will not be entitled to that interest payment (or, if the Issuer elects to make a payment of a portion, but not all, of such interest payment, the portion of such interest payment not paid) on the relevant Interest Payment Date

<<<

.
Upon the occurrence o f a Trigger Event, the principal amount o f the Notes will be Written Down
The Notes are being issued for capital adequacy regulatory purposes with the intention and purpose of being eligible as Additional Tier 1 capital

<<<

 of the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group. Such eligibility depends upon a number of conditions being satisfied, which are reflected in the Conditions of the Notes. One of these relates to the ability of the Notes and the proceeds of their

<<<

 issue to be available to absorb any losses of any of the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group.
Accordingly, if at any time the CET1 Ratio (calculated as provided in the Conditions) of the Bank, the Bank Group and/or (subject as provided below

<<<

) the DNB Group falls below 5.125 per cent., the Issuer shall immediately notify the Norwegian FSA and, without delay and by no later than one month (or such other period as the Norwegian FSA may then require) from the occurrence of the relevant

<<<

 Trigger Event, shall:
(a) cancel all interest accrued to (but excluding) the Write Down Date (whether or not such interest has become due for payment and including any interest scheduled for payment on the Write Down Date); and
(b) (without

<<<

 the need for the consent of the Holders) reduce the then Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note by the relevant Write Down Amount (such reduction, a "Write Down" and "Written Down" being construed accordingly).
The relevant Write Down Amount

<<<

 of each Note will be the lower of (i) and (ii) below:
(i) the amount per Note which is determined by the Bank to be necessary (in conjunction with (a) the concurrent Write Down of the other Notes and (b) the concurrent (or substantially concurrent

<<<

) write-down or conversion into equity of, or other loss absorption measures taken in respect of, any other Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments) to restore each of the Bank's, the Bank Group's and/or (subject

<<<

 as provided below) the DNB Group's (as applicable) CET1 Ratio to at least 5.125 per cent. (and so that the lowest of such CET1 Ratios is equal to (or as near as is practicable equal to but not less than) 5.125 per cent.); and
(ii) the amount

<<<

 necessary to reduce the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note to one cent (or, if the Notes are in definitive form, one cent per Calculation Amount).
If for any reason the Bank is unable to effect the concurrent (or substantially concurrent

<<<

) write-down or conversion of any given Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments within the period required by the Norwegian FSA, the Notes will be Written Down notwithstanding that the relevant Prior
16

Loss

<<<

 Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments are not also written down or converted (and, in such circumstances, the Write Down Amount may be higher than would otherwise have been the case).
Notwithstanding the foregoing,

<<<

 the Norwegian FSA may, in the future, inform the Bank that it no longer requires the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group falling below 5.125 per cent. to constitute a Trigger Event. In such circumstances, the Bank will give notice to Holders pursuant

<<<

 to Condition 7.10 and, thereafter, a Trigger Event will occur only in the event of the CET1 Ratio of the Bank and/or the Bank Group (but not the DNB Group) falling below 5.125 per cent. In such case, the Conditions will be modified by Condition

<<<

 7.10 to give effect to such change, including that the Write Down Amount will no longer be calculated having regard to the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group, and any Discretionary Reinstatement will have no regard to the profits of the DNB Group

<<<

 (but, for the avoidance of doubt, the CET1 Ratio and profits, respectively, of the Bank and the Bank Group will continue to be relevant). In such circumstances, any maximum distributable amount applicable to the DNB Group will also no longer

<<<

 continue to act as a mandatory restriction on payments on the Notes, as further described above under "The Issuer may at any time elect, and in certain circumstances shall be required, not to make interest payments on the Notes'" and "Payments

<<<

 on the Notes will be subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount introduced under the CRR/CRDIV regulations o f 22 August 2014".
The Write Down of the Notes will affect the claims of the Holders in various respects. Firstly, in the event of

<<<

 a winding-up of the Issuer, the claims of the Holders will be in respect of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes at the time of the winding-up of the Issuer, and not for the Original Principal Amount. Similarly, upon a redemption of

<<<

 the Notes by the Issuer following the occurrence of a Capital Event, a Tax Event or a Withholding Tax Event, the redemption amount of each Note will be its Outstanding Principal Amount (together with accrued and unpaid interest) and not its

<<<

 Original Principal Amount. The Issuer is not permitted to redeem the Notes pursuant to Condition 9.2, until any principal amount by which the Notes have been Written Down pursuant to Condition 7 have first been reinstated in full pursuant to

<<<

 Condition 8; however, that restriction does not apply to a redemption following the occurrence of a Capital Event, a Tax Event or a Withholding Tax Event. Investors should note that the restriction under Condition 9.2 applies only to the extent

<<<

 that the Notes have been Written Down pursuant to Condition 7 and does not apply to any part of the principal amount of the Notes which has been written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act - see "The Notes may also be written down by the

<<<

 B a n k 's shareholders or the Norwegian authorities under the Norwegian Bank Security A ct" above.
Secondly, interest will accrue only on the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes from time to time, and accordingly for so long as the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amount of the Notes is less than their Original Principal Amount, the maximum amount of interest which may be paid by the Issuer (subject always to applicable payment restrictions and interest cancellation as provided above) on any

<<<

 Interest Payment Date shall be less than if no Write Down had occurred.
In addition, as the occurrence of a Trigger Event is linked to the CET1 Ratios of the Bank, the Bank Group and (except as provided above) the DNB Group, any reduction in

<<<

 any such CET1 Ratio may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes, and such adverse effect may be particularly significant if there is any indication or expectation that any such CET1 Ratio is or may be trending towards 5.125

<<<

 per cent.
A Write Down may occur on any one or more occasions, and the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes may be reduced in part or in whole (save that no Note shall be Written Down below one cent (or, if the Notes are in definitive

<<<

 form, one cent per Calculation Amount)). Holders will not be entitled to any compensation or other payment as a result of any Write Down of the Notes. Accordingly, if a Trigger Event occurs, Holders could lose all or part of the value of their

<<<

 investment in the Notes if the Issuer subsequently redeems the Notes or a winding-up o f the Issuer occurs.
The occurrence of a Trigger Event is inherently unpredictable and depends on a number of factors, which may be outside the control of

<<<

 the Issuer. The determination by the Bank or the Parent, as applicable, that a Trigger Event has occurred shall be based on information (whether or not published) available to management of the Bank or the Parent, as applicable, including information

<<<

 internally reported within the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group (as applicable) pursuant to procedures for ensuring effective on-going monitoring of the capital ratios of the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group. Accordingly, whether

<<<

 or not any such CET1 Ratio is trending towards 5.125 per cent. may not be easily visible to Holders or other prospective investors. Accordingly, investors
17

may be unable to accurately predict if and when a Trigger Event may occur. See 

<<<

"The circumstances surrounding or triggering a Write Down are unpredictable, and there are a number o ffactors that could affect the CET1 Ratio o f the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group" below.
The Issuer and the DNB Group intend to

<<<

 publish information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of the Issuer, the Bank Group and the DNB Group as part of their financial statements each quarter. However, there can be no assurance that the Issuer and the DNB Group will publicly

<<<

 report such information at such intervals or at any other time.
Whilst the Conditions provide for Discretionary Reinstatement of the principal amount of the Notes in certain circumstances, any such Discretionary Reinstatement will be in the

<<<

 sole and full discretion of the Issuer, there is no provision for the automatic Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes in any circumstances and any Discretionary Reinstatement will be subject to certain restrictions. Discretionary Reinstatement

<<<

 may only occur if each of the Bank, the Bank Group and (except as provided above) the DNB Group generates a net profit in any given financial year, and only a specified percentage of the lowest of any such profits will be available for the

<<<

 Issuer to apply (in its sole discretion) to a Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes. See Condition 8 (Discretionary Reinstatement o f the Notes) for further details on the calculation of such amount. Further, a Discretionary Reinstatement

<<<

 will not be effected in circumstances where it would cause a Trigger Event, or would result in any Maximum Distributable Amount then applicable to the Bank, the Bank Group and/or (except as provided above) the DNB Group to be exceeded. Even

<<<

 if, following a Trigger Event, the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group each record net profits, there can be no assurance that any Discretionary Reinstatement of any part of the principal amount of the Notes will be effected.
In addition

<<<

 to Write Down o f the Notes in accordance with the Conditions, the principal amount o f the Notes may be written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act (as defined below) - see "The Notes may also be written down by the B a n k's shareholders

<<<

 or the Norwegian authorities under the Norwegian Bank Security Act" below.
The circumstances surrounding or triggering a Write Down are unpredictable, and there are a number of factors that could affect the CET1 Ratio o f the Bank, the Bank

<<<

 Group and/or the DNB Group
The occurrence of a Trigger Event is inherently unpredictable and depends on a number of factors, which may be outside the control of the Issuer. The CET1 Ratio of the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group can be

<<<

 expected to fluctuate on an on-going basis and could be affected by one or more factors, including, among other things, changes in the mix of the business of the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group, major events affecting their respective

<<<

 earnings, distributions payments, regulatory changes (including changes to definitions and calculations of the CET1 Ratio and its components, including Common Equity Tier 1 and Risk Weighted Assets) and their ability to manage Risk Weighted

<<<

 Assets.
Further, the calculation of the CET1 Ratio of the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group may also be affected by changes in applicable accounting rules, or by changes to regulatory adjustments which modify the regulatory capital

<<<

 impact of accounting rules, whether or not the fundamental data of the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group which feeds into such accounting or regulatory framework changes.
It will be difficult to predict when, if at all, a Trigger Event

<<<

 may occur. Accordingly, the trading behaviour of the Notes is not necessarily expected to follow the trading behaviour of other types of securities without this feature. Any indication that a Trigger Event may occur can be expected to have

<<<

 a material adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.
The Maximum Distributable Amount, Trigger Event and Discretionary Reinstatement are linked to the CET1 Ratio and Net Profits, respectively, o f the DNB Group (as well as those o f

<<<

 the Bank and the Bank Group) and accordingly will be affected by the performance o f the DNB Group's non-banking businesses as well as the performance o f the Bank Group
In addition to the activities of the Bank Group, the DNB Group also offers

<<<

 a range of other financial services including asset management activities organised under DNB Asset Management Holding AS, life insurance and pension saving products offered by DNB Livsforsikring ASA, and non-life insurance products provided

<<<

 by DNB
18

Skadesforsikring AS. Please see "Description o f the Issuer and the DNB Group - DNB Group - Legal structure" below for further details. As a result, the financial performance of the DNB Group and, therefore, the potential for payment

<<<

 restrictions on the Notes, the occurrence of a Trigger Event and/or Discretionary Reinstatement, will all (subject as provided above under "Upon the occurrence o f a Trigger Event, the principal amount o f the Notes will be Written Down") be

<<<

 affected by or subject to a range of factors affecting those non-banking businesses.
In particular, the calculation of the DNB Group's common equity tier 1 ratio, which is directly linked to a Trigger Event under the Notes (subject as provided

<<<

 above) and relevant to whether or not the DNB Group is meeting its combined buffer requirement, will be affected by the performance of the insurance business. The investments in the insurance businesses in accordance with the current Norwegian

<<<

 regulation are reflected in the capital adequacy of the DNB Group by way of a full consolidation method. Risk weighted assets ("RWA") for the insurance business are calculated and included in the DNB Group's RWA and the common equity tier 

<<<

1 capital of the insurance entities are included in the DNB Group's own funds. Following the implementation of the Solvency II regulation from 1 January 2016, the Norwegian authorities have announced that the capital adequacy treatment of investments

<<<

 in insurance subsidiaries in financial conglomerates will be changed. However, it is not yet known how the Norwegian regulation will be designed within the national discretion allowed under CRR and the conglomerate directive. Negative performance

<<<

 and increased capital needs in the insurance business will have a negative impact on the DNB Group's common equity tier 1 ratio. Norwegian authorities have proposed that key elements of the transitional rules applicable to Solvency II shall

<<<

 be implemented in Norway, among other measures, and that there shall be a 16 year transition period before the full effect of Solvency II has to be recognised.
According to IFRS, the DNB Group shall assess at the end of each reporting period

<<<

 whether its recognised insurance liabilities are adequate, using current estimates of future cash flows under its insurance contracts. If that assessment shows that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities is inadequate in the light

<<<

 of future cash flows, the entire deficiency shall be recognised in profit or loss. Hence, the DNB Group's common equity tier 1 capital will be reduced accordingly, which will adversely affect the DNB Group's common equity tier 1 ratio.
The

<<<

 DNB Group also comprises DNB Asset Management and the performance of this business will also be recognised in the DNB Group's financial position. Hence, a negative performance in the Asset Management business will negatively impact the financial

<<<

 performance and the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group.
The Notes do not contain events o f default and the enforcement rights available to Holders under the Notes are limited
The terms of the Notes do not provide for any events of default. Holders

<<<

 may not at any time demand repayment or redemption of their Notes, and enforcement rights for any payment are limited to the claim of Holders in a winding-up of the Issuer. In a winding-up of the Issuer, the holder of any Note may prove or

<<<

 claim in such proceedings in respect of such Note, such claim being for payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount of such Note at the time of commencement of such winding-up together with any interest accrued and unpaid on such Note (to the

<<<

 extent that the same is not cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Notes) from (and including) the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding commencement of such winding-up and any other amounts payable on such Note under the Conditions

<<<

. Under Norwegian law, a Holders' claim will be converted to NOK at the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which the Issuer entered into public administration.
A Holder may not itself file for the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer

<<<

.
The Notes are not protected under the Norwegian Banksikringsfond
The Banksikringsfond is the statutory fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms paying compensation to customers if the firm is unable, or likely

<<<

 to be unable, to pay certain claims (including in respect of deposits and insurance policies) made against it (together, "Protected Liabilities").
The Notes are not, however, Protected Liabilities under such scheme and, moreover, are not guaranteed

<<<

 or insured by any government, government agency or compensation scheme of the Kingdom of Norway or any other jurisdiction.
19

There is no scheduled redemption datefor the Notes and Holders have no right to require redemption
The Notes have

<<<

 no fixed maturity. The Issuer has no obligation at any time to redeem the Notes, and the Holders have no rights to require redemption or purchase of the Notes by the Bank at any time.
Provided that any amount of principal Written Down pursuant

<<<

 to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) has first been reinstated pursuant to Condition 8 (Discretionary Reinstatement o f the Notes), the Issuer may redeem the Notes (in whole but not in part) in its sole discretion, subject

<<<

 to the approval of the Norwegian FSA and to compliance with Applicable Banking Regulations, on the First Call Date or any Interest Payment Date thereafter at their Redemption Amount. Investors should note that the foregoing proviso applies

<<<

 only to the extent that the Notes have been Written Down pursuant to Condition 7 and does not apply to any part of the principal amount of the Notes which has been written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act - see "The Notes may also be

<<<

 written down by the B a n k 's shareholders or the Norwegian authorities under the Norwegian Bank Security Act" above.
Further, following the occurrence of a Capital Event, a Tax Event or a Withholding Tax Event, the Issuer may redeem the Notes

<<<

 (in whole but not in part) in its sole discretion, subject to the approval of the Norwegian FSA and to compliance with Applicable Banking Regulations, at any time at their Redemption Amount.
At any time when the Notes may be redeemed by the

<<<

 Issuer or the market anticipates that the redemption right will become available, the market price of the Notes is unlikely to substantially exceed the price at which the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes. If the Issuer redeems the Notes

<<<

 in any of the circumstances mentioned above, there is a risk that the Notes may be redeemed at times when the redemption proceeds are less than the current market value of the Notes or when prevailing interest rates may be relatively low, in

<<<

 which latter case Holders may only be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in Notes with a lower yield. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
It is not possible to predict

<<<

 whether the events referred to above will occur and lead to circumstances in which the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, and if so whether or not the Issuer will satisfy the conditions, or elect, to redeem the Notes. The Issuer may be more

<<<

 likely to exercise its option to redeem the Notes at a time when its funding costs would be lower than the prevailing interest rate payable in respect of the Notes. If the Notes are so redeemed, there can be no assurance that Holders will be

<<<

 able to reinvest the amounts received upon redemption at a rate that will provide as favourable a rate of return as their investment in the Notes.
Substitution and variation
If at any time a Tax Event, a Withholding Tax Event or a Capital Event

<<<

 occurs, the Bank may, instead of giving notice to redeem the Notes as aforesaid, but solely to the extent permitted at such time by Applicable Banking Regulations and subject to the approval of the Norwegian FSA, having given not less than

<<<

 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the holders of the Notes, either substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes for, or vary the terms of the Notes provided that they remain or become, Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Notes.
Whilst Qualifying

<<<

 Additional Tier 1 Notes must have terms which (as reasonably determined by the Bank) are not materially less favourable to the Holders than the Notes, there can be no assurance that the terms of the substitute or varied Notes will be as favourable

<<<

 to all Holders in all circumstances.
The Notes are novel and complex financial instruments that involve a high degree o f risk and may not be a suitable investmentfor all investors
The Notes are novel and complex financial instruments that

<<<

 involve a high degree of risk. As a result, an investment in the Notes will involve certain increased risks. Each potential investor of the Notes must determine the suitability (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) of that

<<<

 investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:
(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information

<<<

 contained in this Prospectus;
20

(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on

<<<

 its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all o f the risks o f an investment in the Notes, including where such potential investor's financial activities are principally denominated in

<<<

 a currency other than U.S. dollars, and the possibility that substantially the entire principal amount o f the Notes could be lost in the event o f a Write Down or other write down o f the Notes;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the

<<<

 Notes (including, in particular, calculation of the CET1 Ratio of the Bank, the Bank Group and the DNB Group, as well as under what circumstances the Trigger Event will occur and the circumstances in which interest payments must be cancelled

<<<

); and
(v) be able to evaluate possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Sophisticated investors generally do not purchase complex financial

<<<

 instruments that bear a high degree o f risk as stand-alone investments. They purchase such financial instruments as a way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios

<<<

. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless they have the knowledge and expertise (either alone or with a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the likelihood

<<<

 o f cancellation o f interest and/or Write Down and the value o f the Notes, and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment portfolio. Prior to making an investment decision, potential investors should

<<<

 consider carefully, in light o f their own financial circumstances and investment objectives, all the information contained in this Prospectus.
The Notes are held by or on behalf o f Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg; investors will have

<<<

 to rely on the clearing system proceduresfor transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer
The Notes will, upon issue, be deposited with, and registered in the name o f a nominee for, a common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. 

<<<

("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme ("Clearstream, Luxembourg). Except in the circumstances described in the Global Certificate, investors will not be entitled to receive individual note certificates ("Note Certificates")

<<<

. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records o f the beneficial interests in the Notes represented by the Global Certificate. While the Notes are in global form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only

<<<

 through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.
While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to or to the order o f the common depositary. A holder

<<<

 o f a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to

<<<

, or payments made by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg in respect of, beneficial interests in such Notes represented by the Global Certificate.
Investors who hold less than the U.S.$200,000 may be unable to sell their Notes and may be adversely

<<<

 affected if Note Certificates are subsequently required to be issued
The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum denomination of U.S.$200,000 plus integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof. It is possible that such Notes may

<<<

 be traded in amounts in excess of U.S.$200,000 that are not integral multiples o f such minimum specified denomination. In such a case a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than the U.S.$200,000 in

<<<

 its account with the relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the remainder o f such holding without first purchasing a principal amount of Notes at or in excess of U.S.$200,000 such that its holding amounts to U.S.$200,000. Further

<<<

, a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than U.S.$200,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time will not be entitled to receive a Note Certificate in respect of such

<<<

 holding (should Note Certificates be printed) and would need to purchase additional Notes such that it holds at least a principal amount of U.S.$200,000 in order to receive its Note Certificate representing those Notes.
21

If such Note Certificates

<<<

 are issued, holders should be aware that Note Certificates which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of the U.S.$200,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Meetings o fHolders and modification

The Fiscal Agency Agreement

<<<

 and the Conditions o f the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings o f Holders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Holders including Holders who did not attend

<<<

 and vote at the relevant meeting and Holders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.

In addition, the Fiscal Agent and the Bank may agree, without the consent o f the Holders, to:

(i)

any modification (except such modifications in

<<<

 respect o f which an increased quorum is required as

mentioned in Condition 16.1) to the Notes and/or the Conditions which is not prejudicial to the interests

o f the Holders; or

(ii) subject to Condition 9.7 (Conditions to redemption etc

<<<

.), any modification to the Notes and/or the Conditions which is of a formal, minor or technical nature or is made to correct a manifest error or to comply with mandatory provisions of the law.

Any such modification shall be binding on the

<<<

 Holders.

W ith respect to (i) above, the inclusion of a term in the Conditions that prohibits or restricts the Issuer's discretion to cancel payments of interest otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date following the occurrence

<<<

 o f a Capital Event will be treated as a modification which is not prejudicial to the interests o f the Holders, provided that the inclusion o f such term does not result in the occurrence o f a Capital Event, a Withholding Tax Event or a Tax

<<<

 Event.
Change o f law

The Conditions o f the Notes will be governed by the laws o f England save that the provisions regarding subordination o f the Notes, Write Down and Discretionary Reinstatement will be governed by the laws o f Norway

. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of England or Norway or administrative practice after the date o f this Prospectus.
Legality o f purchase

Neither the Issuer nor any o f its

 affiliates has or assumes responsibility for the lawfulness o f the acquisition o f the Notes by a prospective investor in the Notes, whether under the laws o f the jurisdiction o f its incorporation or the jurisdiction in which it operates

<<<

 (if different), or for compliance by that prospective investor with any law, regulation or regulatory policy applicable to it. The Managers are also required to comply with the TMR Rules and as a result of this compliance, prospective investors

<<<

 will be required to give the representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings as set out on page 3 of this Prospectus.

Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments

The investment activities of certain investors

<<<

 are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (i) Notes are legal investments for it,

<<<

 (ii) Notes can be used as collateral for various types o f borrowing and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine

<<<

 the appropriate treatment o f Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.
EU Savings Directive

Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities

<<<

 o f other Member States details o f certain payments o f interest or similar income paid or secured

22

by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types

<<<

 of entities established in another Member State.
On 24 March, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these

<<<

 new requirements from 1 January, 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The changes will also expand the circumstances in which

<<<

 payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are

<<<

 satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.
For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise

<<<

) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which still operate a withholding system when they are implemented

<<<

.
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted

<<<

 similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that

<<<

 payment, neither the Issuer nor any Paying and Transfer Agent (as defined in the Conditions of the Notes) nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the imposition of such withholding

<<<

 tax. The Issuer is required to maintain a Paying and Transfer Agent in a Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the Directive.
Payments on the Notes may be subject to U.S. withholding under FATCA
The United States

<<<

 has enacted rules, commonly referred to as "FATCA", that generally impose a new reporting and withholding regime with respect to certain U.S. source payments (including dividends and interest), gross proceeds from the disposition of property

<<<

 that can produce U.S. source interest and dividends and certain payments made by entities that are classified as financial institutions under FATCA. The United States has entered into an intergovernmental agreement regarding the implementation

<<<

 of FATCA with Norway (the "Norway IGA"). Under the Norway IGA, as currently drafted, the Issuer does not expect payments made on or with respect to the Notes to be subject to withholding under FATCA. However, significant aspects of when and

<<<

 how FATCA will apply remain unclear, and no assurance can be given that withholding under FATCA will not become relevant with respect to payments made on or with respect to the Notes in the future. Prospective investors should consult their

<<<

 own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of FATCA.
RISKS RELATED TO THE MARKET GENERALLY
Set out below is a brief description of certain market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk:

<<<


The secondary market generally
The Notes represent a new instrument for which no secondary trading market currently exists and there can be no assurance that one will develop. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore,

<<<

 investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value

<<<

 of Notes.
If a market for the Notes does develop, the trading price of the Notes may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including those referred to in this risk factor, as well as stock market fluctuations and general

<<<

 economic conditions that may adversely affect the market price of the Notes. Publicly traded Notes from
23

time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies

<<<

 that have issued them, and such volatility may be increased in an illiquid market. If any market in the Notes does develop, it may become severely restricted, or may disappear, if the financial condition and/or the CET1 Ratio of the Bank, the

<<<

 Bank Group and/or the DNB Group deteriorates such that there is an actual or perceived increased likelihood of the Issuer being unable or unwilling to pay interest on the Notes in full, or of the Notes being Written Down or otherwise subject

<<<

 to loss absorption or an applicable statutory loss absorption regime. In addition, the market price of the Notes may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer's control, including:
· variations

<<<

 in operating results of the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group;
· any shortfall in revenue or net profit or any increase in losses from levels expected by market commentators;
· increases in capital expenditure compared with expectations

<<<

;
· any perception that the Bank's and/or the DNB Group's strategy is or may be less effective than previously assumed or that the Bank and/or the DNB Group is not effectively implementing any significant projects;
· changes in financial estimates

<<<

 by Notes analysts;
· changes in market valuations of similar entities;
· announcements by the Bank and/or the DNB Group of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, new initiatives, new services or new service ranges;


<<<

· regulatory matters, including changes in regulatory regulations or Norwegian FSA requirements;
· additions or departures of key personnel; and
· future issues or sales of Notes or other securities.
Any or all of these events could result in

<<<

 material fluctuations in the price of Notes which could lead to investors losing some or all of their investment.
The issue price of the Notes might not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market, and there can be no assurance

<<<

 that an investor would be able to sell its Notes at or near the price which it paid for them, or at a price that would provide it with a yield comparable to more conventional investments that have a developed secondary market.
Moreover, although

<<<

 the Issuer or any member of the DNB Group may (subject to the approval of the Norwegian FSA and compliance with Applicable Banking Regulations) purchase Notes at any time, they have no obligation to do so. Purchases made by the Issuer or any

<<<

 member of the DNB Group could affect the liquidity of the secondary market of the Notes and thus the price and the conditions under which investors can negotiate these Notes on the secondary market.
In addition, Holders should be aware of the

<<<

 prevailing and widely reported global credit market conditions (which continue at the date of this Prospectus), whereby there is a general lack of liquidity in the secondary market which may result in investors suffering losses on the Notes

<<<

 in secondary re-sales even if there is no decline in the performance of the Notes or the financial condition of the Bank, the Bank Group or the DNB Group. The Issuer cannot predict whether these circumstances will change and whether, if and

<<<

 when they do change, there will be a more liquid market for the Notes and instruments similar to the Notes at that time.
Although application has been made for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Irish Stock Exchange, there is no assurance

<<<

 that such application will be accepted or that an active trading market will develop.
24

Exchange rate risks and exchange controls
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in U.S. dollars. This presents certain risks relating

<<<

 to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than U.S. dollars. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change

<<<

 (including changes due to devaluation of U.S. dollars or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency or U.S. dollars may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation

<<<

 in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to U.S. dollars would decrease (i) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (iii) the Investor

<<<

's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less

<<<

 interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal as measured in the Investor's Currency.
The value o f the Notes may be adversely affected by movements in market interest rates
Investment in the Notes, which bear a fixed rate

<<<

 of interest (which will be reset on each Reset Date), involves the risk that if market interest rates subsequently increase above the relevant rate paid on the Notes, this will adversely affect the value of the Notes. In addition, a Holder

<<<

 of the Notes is exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks and may be lowered, suspended, withdrawn or not maintained S&P is expected to assign a credit rating

<<<

 of "BBB-" to the Notes. In addition, S&P, Moody's and DBRS have assigned credit ratings to the Issuer. The Notes or, as the case may be, the Issuer may also be assigned unsolicited credit ratings by any rating agency. These ratings may not

<<<

 reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes or the standing of the Issuer. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell

<<<

 or hold securities and any rating agency may revise, suspend or withdraw at any time the relevant rating assigned by it if, in the sole judgement of the relevant rating agency, among other things, the credit quality of the Notes or, as the

<<<

 case may be, the Issuer has declined or is in question. In addition, there is no guarantee that any rating of the Notes and/or the Issuer will be maintained by the Issuer following the date of this Prospectus. If any rating assigned to the

<<<

 Notes and/or the Issuer, including any unsolicited credit rating, is assigned at a lower level than expected or subsequently revised lower, suspended, withdrawn or not maintained by the Issuer, the market value of the Notes may be reduced.

<<<

 The Issuer is exposed to changes in the rating methodologies applied by rating agencies. Any adverse changes of such methodologies may materially and adversely affect the Issuer's operations or financial condition, the Issuer's willingness

<<<

 or ability to leave individual transactions outstanding and adversely affect the Issuer's capital market standing. In particular, there is an on-going debate about rating methodologies for hybrid capital instruments such as the Notes.

 Loss Absorption:

Trigger Event and Write-Down
If at any time the Bank (in respect of the CET1 Ratio of the Bank and the Bank Group) or (subject as provided below) the Parent (in respect of the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group) determines that the

<<<

 CET1 Ratio for any of the Bank, the Bank Group and/or (subject as provided below) the DNB Group has fallen below 5.125 per cent. (a "Trigger Event"), then the Bank shall immediately

28

notify the Norwegian FSA and, without delay and by no

<<<

 later than one month (or such other period as the Norwegian FSA may then require) from the occurrence of the relevant Trigger Event, shall:
(i) cancel all interest accrued to (but excluding) the Write Down Date (whether or not such interest

<<<

 has become due for payment and including any interest scheduled for payment on the Write Down Date); and
(ii) (without the need for the consent of the holders) reduce the then Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note by the relevant Write

<<<

 Down Amount (such reduction, a "Write Down" and "Written Down" being construed accordingly).
Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments
Write Down of the Notes will be effected, save as may otherwise be required

<<<

 by the Norwegian FSA:
(i) following, or concurrently (or substantially concurrently) with, the write-down or conversion into equity of the entire (save, if applicable, for any one cent or similar floor contained in the terms thereof) outstanding

<<<

 principal amount of any Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments; and
(ii) pro rata with (a) the concurrent Write Down of the other Notes and (b) the concurrent (or substantially concurrent) write-down or conversion into equity, as the case may be

<<<

, of any Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments (based on the prevailing principal amount of the relevant Parity Loss Absorbing Instrument),
provided, however, that if for any reason the Bank is unable to effect the concurrent (or substantially concurrent

<<<

) write-down or conversion of any given Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments within the period required by the Norwegian FSA, the Notes will be Written Down notwithstanding that the relevant Prior Loss Absorbing

<<<

 Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments are not also written down or converted.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Bank is unable to write down or convert any Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss

<<<

 Absorbing Instruments as aforesaid, the Write Down Amount determined in accordance with part (i) of the definition of "Write Down Amount" will be calculated on the basis that such Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing

<<<

 Instruments are not available to be written down or converted, and accordingly the Write Down Amount determined in accordance with that part (i) will be higher than it would otherwise have been if such Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or

<<<

 Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments had been available to be written down or converted.
Write Down Amount
"Write Down Amount" means, with respect to each Note (calculated per Calculation Amount if the Notes are in definitive form), the lower

<<<

 of (i) and (ii) below:
(i) the amount per Note which is determined by the Bank to be necessary (in conjunction with (a) the concurrent Write Down of the other Notes and (b) the concurrent (or substantially concurrent) write-down or conversion

<<<

 into equity of, or other loss absorption measures taken in
29

respect of, any other Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments, in each case in the manner and to the extent provided above under "Prior Loss Absorbing

<<<

 Instruments and Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments ") to restore each of the Bank's, the Bank Group's and/or (subject as provided below) the DNB Group's (as applicable) CET1 Ratio to at least 5.125 per cent. (and so that the lowest of such CET

<<<

1 Ratios is equal to (or as near as is practicable equal to but not less than) 5.125 per cent.); and

(ii) the amount necessary to reduce the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note to one cent (or, if the Notes are in definitive form, one

<<<

 cent per Calculation Amount) (and all references to the one cent floor in respect of the Notes shall be construed accordingly).

"Calculation Amount" means U.S.$1,000 in principal amount of each Note.

The principal amount of a Note shall not

<<<

 at any time be reduced to below one cent (or, if the Notes are in definitive form, one cent per Calculation Amount) as a result of a Write Down.

Cancellation not automatic
If the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes is Written Down to

<<<

 one cent (or, if the Notes are in definitive form, one cent per Calculation Amount), the Notes will not be automatically cancelled.

Write Down may occur on more than one occasion; No default
A Trigger Event may occur on more than one occasion

<<<

 and each Note may be Written Down on more than one occasion. Any such Write Down shall not constitute a default under the terms of the Notes for any purpose.

Fall away o fDNB Group Trigger
If at any time the Bank is no longer required to treat

<<<

 the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group falling below 5.125 per cent. as a Trigger Event, as notified to the Bank by the Norwegian FSA, the Bank will, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days of being so notified

<<<

 by the Norwegian FSA), give notice of the same to the Holders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices). With effect from the time of such notice, the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group falling below 5.125 per cent. will cease to constitute a Trigger

<<<

 Event and the definition of Trigger Event shall, from such time, be construed accordingly.

Such notice shall be irrevocable, and will result in certain consequential modifications to the Conditions, as referred to in Condition 7.10(iii).


<<<


Discretionary Reinstatement:

Discretionary Reinstatement
If, at any time following a Write Down, each Relevant Entity records a positive Net Profit, the Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, increase the Outstanding Principal Amount

<<<

 of the Notes (a "Discretionary Reinstatement") by such amount (calculated per Calculation Amount if the Notes are in definitive form) as the Bank may elect, provided that such Discretionary Reinstatement shall not:

(i) result in the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amount of the Notes being greater than their Original Principal Amount;

(ii) result in the occurrence of a Trigger Event; or

30

(iii) result in the Maximum Write-up Amount to be exceeded when taken together with the aggregate

<<<

 of:
(a) any previous Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes out of the same Relevant Profits since the Reference Date (if any);
(b) the aggregate amount of any interest on the Notes that has been paid or calculated (but disregarding any such

<<<

 calculated interest which has been cancelled) since the Reference Date on the basis of an Outstanding Principal Amount that is lower than the Original Principal Amount;
(c) the aggregate amount of the increase in principal amount of the Written

<<<

-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments to be written-up out of the same Relevant Profits concurrently (or substantially concurrently) with the Discretionary Reinstatement and (if applicable) any previous increase in principal amount out of the

<<<

 same Relevant Profits of such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments since the Reference Date; and
(d) the aggregate amount of any interest on such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments that have been paid or calculated (but disregarding

<<<

 any such calculated interest which has been cancelled) since the Reference Date on the basis of a prevailing principal amount that is lower than the original principal amount at which such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments were issued

<<<

.
A Discretionary Reinstatement will also not be effected in circumstances in which it would cause any Maximum Distributable Amount then applicable to any o f the Bank, the Bank Group and/or the DNB Group (as further described below) to be exceeded

<<<

.
The "M aximum W rite-up Am ount" means:
(A) (i) the Relevant Profits, multiplied by (ii) the sum of the aggregate Original Principal Amount of the Notes and the aggregate original principal amount of all Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments

<<<

 issued directly or indirectly by the Relevant Entity whose Net Profits are the Relevant Profits referred to in (A)(i), divided by (iii) the total Tier 1 Capital of such Relevant Entity as at the date of the relevant Discretionary Reinstatement

<<<

; or
(B) such higher amount as may be permissible pursuant to Applicable Banking Regulations then in force.
Write-up o f Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments
Any Discretionary Reinstatement shall be applied concurrently (or substantially

<<<

 concurrently) and pro rata with other write-ups to be effected out of the Relevant Profits in respect of any Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments.
The Bank will not reinstate the principal amount of any Written-Down Additional Tier 1

<<<

 Instrument that have terms permitting a write-up of such principal amount to occur out of the Relevant Profits on a similar basis to that set out in respect of the Notes unless it does do on a pro rata basis with a Discretionary Reinstatement

<<<

 of the Notes.
31

Discretionary Reinstatement may occur on more than one occasion
A Discretionary Reinstatement may occur on one or more occasions until the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes has been reinstated to the Original Principal

<<<

 Amount.

For the avoidance of doubt, Discretionary Reinstatement shall apply to the Notes only if, and to the extent that, the Notes have been Written Down following the occurrence of a Trigger Event in accordance with the provisions of "Principal

<<<

 Loss Absorption" above. If at any time the Notes are written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act (as further described below), the principal amount by which the Notes are written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act shall not be reinstated

<<<

 (whether by way of Discretionary Reinstatement or otherwise) in any circumstances.

Loss Absorption under the Norwegian Bank Security Act

In addition to the provisions of "Principal Loss Absorption" above, the Notes may be written down by

<<<

 the shareholders of the Bank or by the Norwegian authorities pursuant to powers granted to them under Chapter 3 of the Norwegian Bank Security Act of 6 December 1996 No 75 (Lov om sikringsordninger fo r banker, forsikringsselskapenes garantiordninger

<<<

 og offentlig administrasjon m.v. av finansinstitusjoner) (the "Bank Security Act"), as further described in "Risk Factors - The Notes may also be written down by the B ank's shareholders or the Norwegian authorities under the Norwegian Bank

<<<

 Security Act".

Maximum Distributable Amount:

In circumstances where section 6 of the CRR/CRD IV regulations of 22 August 2014 (forskrift om kapitalkrav og nasjonal tilpasning av CRR/CRD IV) (the "August 2014 Regulations") applies, no payments

<<<

 (or deemed payments) will be made on the Notes (whether by way of principal, interest, Discretionary Reinstatement or otherwise) if and to the extent that such payment would, when aggregated together with other distributions of the kind referred

<<<

 to in section 6(2) of the August 2014 Regulations, cause the maximum distributable amount (if any), determined in accordance with section 6(3) of the August 2014 Regulations then applicable to any of the Bank, the Bank Group and/or (unless

<<<

 the Norwegian FSA no longer requires) the DNB Group to be exceeded. See "Risk Factors - Payments on the Notes will be subject to the Maximum Distributable Amount introduced under the CRR/CRD IVregulations o f 22 August 2014".

Interest:

Subject

<<<

 as described below under "Cancellation o f Interest Payments", the Notes will bear interest on their Outstanding Principal Amount from time to time at the relevant rate of interest, payable annually in arrear on 26 March in each year, (each

<<<

 such date for the payment of interest being an "Interest Paym ent Date").

The initial rate of interest shall be 5.75 per cent. per annum, which shall apply from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the First Call Date (as defined

<<<

 below).

Such rate will be reset on the First Call Date and on each fifth anniversary of the First Call Date (together with the First Call Date, each a "Reset Date") as the sum of the applicable 5 Year Mid-Swap Rate (calculated as set out in

<<<

 the Conditions) plus the initial credit spread of 4.075 per cent, converted from a semi-annual to an annual basis in a commercially reasonable manner.

The first Interest Payment Date will be 26 March 2016.

Cancellation of Interest Payments

<<<

:
Interest non-cumulative; no default
Redemption:

Optional cancellation o f interest
The Bank may elect at any time, in its sole and full discretion, to cancel (in whole or in part) any payment of interest otherwise scheduled to be paid on

<<<

 an Interest Payment Date.

Non-payment of any amount of interest scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date will constitute evidence of cancellation of the relevant payment, whether or not notice of cancellation has been given by the

<<<

 Bank.

The Norwegian FSA may also direct the Bank to exercise its discretion to cancel interest scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date.

Insufficient Distributable Items
Payments of interest in respect of the Notes in any financial

<<<

 year shall only be made out of Distributable Items of the Bank. The Bank will cancel any interest otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date if and to the extent that the amount of such interest, when aggregated together with

<<<

 any interest payments or distributions which have been made or which are required to be paid or made during the then current financial year on all other own funds items of the Bank (excluding any such interest payments or distributions which

<<<

 (i) are not required to be made out of Distributable Items or (ii) have already been provided for, by way of deduction, in the calculation of Distributable Items), exceeds the amount of Distributable Items of the Bank as at such Interest Payment

<<<

 Date.

Maximum Distributable Amount
In addition, the Bank will also cancel any interest to the extent required as provided above under "Maximum Distributable A m ount".

If the payment of interest scheduled on an Interest Payment Date is cancelled

<<<

, in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions of "Cancellation o f Interest Payments", the Bank shall not have any obligation to make such interest payment (or the cancelled part thereof) on such Interest Payment Date or any time

<<<

 thereafter and the failure to pay such interest (or the cancelled part thereof) shall not constitute a default of the Bank for any purpose.

Any such interest will not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, the Bank will not be obliged

<<<

 to (and will not) make any other payment or settlement in any form in lieu thereof, and holders of the Notes shall have no right thereto whether in a winding-up of the Bank or otherwise.

, eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest). If only two quotations are provided, the Reset Reference Bank Rate will be the

<<<

 arithmetic mean of the quotations provided. If only one quotation is provided, the Reset Reference Bank Rate will be the quotation provided. If no quotations are provided, the Reset Reference Bank Rate in respect of the relevant Reset Date

<<<

 will be (i) in the case of each Reset Date other than the First Call Date, the 5 Year Mid-Swap Rate in respect of the immediately preceding Reset Date or (ii) in the case of the First Call Date, 1.595 per cent.;

5.4 Calculation o f Amount o f interest: The amount of interest payable (subject to Condition 6 (Interest

<<<

 Cancellation) and Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event)) in respect of a Note shall be calculated per Calculation Amount. The amount of interest per Calculation Amount for any period shall be calculated by the Agent Bank

<<<

 by (a) applying the prevailing Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount, (b) multiplying such sum by the Day Count Fraction and (c) rounding the resultant figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance

<<<

 with applicable market convention). The amount of interest payable (subject as aforesaid) in respect of such Note shall be the amount determined per Calculation Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amount of such Note and the denominator is the Calculation Amount, without any further rounding.

If, pursuant to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) or Condition 8 (Discretionary Reinstatement o f the Notes) or as otherwise

<<<

 required by then current legislation and/or regulations applicable to the Bank, the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes is reduced and/or reinstated during an Interest Period, the amount of interest will be adjusted by the Agent Bank

<<<

 to reflect interest having accrued on the relevant Outstanding Principal Amount during each part of such Interest Period.

In these Conditions "Day Count Fraction" means a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the relevant

<<<

 period (from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue to, but excluding, the date on which it falls due, such number of days being calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with twelve 30-day months) and the denominator

<<<

 of which is 360.

The interest amount which (subject to Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date up to (and including) the First Call Date

<<<

 will (if paid in full, and assuming no Write Down of the Notes has occurred) be U.S.$57.50 per Calculation Amount.

5.5 Determination and notification o f Reset Interest Rate: The Agent Bank will, on each Reset Interest Determination Date,

<<<

 determine the Reset Interest Rate applicable to the corresponding Reset Date. The Fiscal Agent shall, promptly following determination thereof, cause such Reset Interest Rate to be notified to the Bank, to the Holders in accordance with Condition

<<<

 17 (Notices) and, if the Notes are listed on a stock exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, to such exchange.
5.6 Accrual o f interest: Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless payment of the

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amount in respect thereof is improperly withheld or refused, in which case it will continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition until whichever is the earlier of:

(i)

the day on which all sums due in respect

<<<

 of such Note up to that day are received by or on

behalf of the relevant Holder; and

45

(ii)

the day which is seven days after the Fiscal Agent has notified the Holders in accordance with

Condition 17 (Notices) that it has received all

<<<

 sums due in respect of the Notes up to such

seventh day (except to the extent that there is any subsequent default in payment).

5.7 Notifications etc: All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and

<<<

 decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of this Condition by the Fiscal Agent, the Agent Bank or the Reset Reference Banks (or any of them) will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith or manifest error) be binding

<<<

 on the Bank, the Paying and Transfer Agents and the Holders and (subject as aforesaid) no liability to any such person will attach to the Fiscal Agent, the Agent Bank or the Reset Reference Banks (or any o f them) in connection with the exercise

<<<

 or non-exercise by it o f its powers, duties and discretions for such purposes.

6.

Interest Cancellation

6.1 Optional Interest Cancellation: The Bank may elect at any time, in its sole and full discretion, to cancel (in whole or in part

<<<

, as applicable) any payment of interest otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date.

The Norwegian FSA may also direct the Bank to exercise its discretion to cancel interest scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date.

<<<



In circumstances where section 6 o f the CRR/CRD IV regulations o f 22 August 2014 (forskrift om kapitalkrav og nasjonal tilpasning av CRR/CRD IV) (the "August 2014 Regulations") applies, no payments (or deemed payments) will be made on the

<<<

 Notes (whether by way o f principal, interest, Discretionary Reinstatement or otherwise) i f and to the extent that such payment would, when aggregated together with other distributions o f the kind referred to in section 6(2) o f the August

<<<

 2014 Regulations, cause the maximum distributable amount (if any), determined in accordance with section 6(3) o f the August 2014 Regulations (a "Maximum Distributable Amount") then applicable to any o f the Bank, the Bank Group and/or (unless

<<<

 the Norwegian FSA no longer requires) the DNB Group to be exceeded.

6.2 Insufficient Distributable Items: Payments of interest in respect of the Notes in any financial year shall only be made out of Distributable Items of the Bank. The Bank

<<<

 will cancel any interest otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date if and to the extent that the amount of such interest, when aggregated together with any interest payments or distributions which have been made or which are

<<<

 required to be paid or made during the then current financial year on all other own funds items of the Bank (excluding any such interest payments or distributions which (i) are not required to be made out of Distributable Items or (ii) have

<<<

 already been provided for, by way of deduction, in the calculation of Distributable Items), exceeds the amount of Distributable Items of the Bank as at such Interest Payment Date.

6.3 Notice o f Interest Cancellation: The Bank shall give notice

<<<

 to the Holders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) and to the Fiscal Agent of any such cancellation of a payment of interest, which notice might be given after the date on which the relevant payment of interest is scheduled to be made

<<<

, provided that any failure to give any such notice shall not affect the cancellation of the relevant interest payment and shall not constitute a default of the Bank for any purpose. Non-payment of any amount of interest (in whole or in part

<<<

) scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date will constitute evidence of cancellation of the relevant payment (or the relevant part thereof), whether or not notice of cancellation has been given by the Bank.

6.4 Interest non-cumulative

<<<

; no default: If the payment of interest scheduled on an Interest Payment Date is cancelled, in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions of this Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation), the Bank shall not have any obligation to make such

<<<

 interest payment (or the cancelled part thereof) on such Interest Payment Date or any time thereafter and the failure to pay such interest (or the cancelled part thereof) shall not constitute a default of the Bank under the Notes or for any

<<<

 purpose.

46

Any such interest will not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, the Bank will not be obliged to (and will not) make any other payment or settlement in any form in lieu thereof, and Holders shall have no right thereto

<<<

 whether in a winding-up of the Bank or otherwise.

7.

Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event

7.1 Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event: If at any time the Bank (in respect of the CET1 Ratio of the Bank and the Bank Group) or (subject

<<<

 to Condition 7.10) the Parent (in respect of the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group) determines that the CET1 Ratio for any of the Bank, the Bank Group and/or (subject to Condition 7.10) the DNB Group has fallen below 5.125 per cent. (a "Trigger Event

<<<

"), then the Bank shall immediately notify the Norwegian FSA and, without delay and by no later than one month (or such other period as the Norwegian FSA may then require) from the occurrence of the relevant Trigger Event, shall:

(i) cancel

<<<

 all interest accrued to (but excluding) the Write Down Date (whether or not such interest has become due for payment and including any interest scheduled for payment on the Write Down Date); and

(ii) (without the need for the consent of the

<<<

 Holders) reduce the then Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note by the relevant Write Down Amount (such reduction, a "W rite Down" and "W ritten Down" being construed accordingly).

In addition to the provisions o f "Principal Loss Absorption

<<<

 " above, the Notes may be written down by the shareholders o f the Bank or by the Norwegian authorities pursuant to powers granted to them under Chapter 3 o f the Norwegian Bank Security Act o f 6 December 1996 No 75 (Lov om sikringsordninger

<<<

 for banker, forsikringsselskapenes garantiordninger og offentlig administrasjon m.v. av finansinstitusjoner) (the "Bank Security A ct"). See Risk Factors - "The Notes may also be written down by the B ank's shareholders or the Norwegian authorities

<<<

 under the Norwegian Bank Security A c t".

7.2 Write Down Notice: The Bank shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination that a Trigger Event has occurred, and in any event not more than 5 days following such determination

<<<

, give notice (which notice shall be irrevocable) to the Holders (the "W rite Down Notice") in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) and to the Fiscal Agent stating:

(i)

that the Trigger Event has occurred;

(ii) the date on which the Write

<<<

 Down will take effect (the "W rite Down Date"); and

(iii) if then determined, the principal amount (expressed per Calculation Amount or as a percentage) by which each Note will be Written Down on the Write Down Date.

If the Write Down Amount

<<<

 has not been determined when the Write Down Notice is given, the Bank shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following such determination, notify Holders of the Write Down Amount in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices).

Any failure or

<<<

 delay by the Bank in giving any such notice to the Holders referred to under this Condition 7.2 (Write Down Notice) will not in any way impact on the effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any Write Down, or give Holders any rights as a

<<<

 result of such failure or delay, and shall not constitute a default by the Bank under the Notes or for any purpose.

7.3 Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments: Write Down of the Notes will be effected, save

<<<

 as may otherwise be required by the Norwegian FSA:

47

(i) following, or concurrently (or substantially concurrently) with, the write-down or conversion into equity of the entire (save, if applicable, for any one cent or similar floor contained

<<<

 in the terms thereof) outstanding principal amount of any Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments; and

(ii) pro rata with (a) the concurrent Write Down of the other Notes; and (b) the concurrent (or substantially concurrent) write-down or conversion

<<<

 into equity, as the case may be, of any Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments (based on the prevailing principal amount of the relevant Parity Loss Absorbing Instrument),

provided, however, that if for any reason the Bank is unable to effect the

<<<

 concurrent (or substantially concurrent) write-down or conversion of any given Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments within the period required by the Norwegian FSA, the Notes will be Written Down notwithstanding

<<<

 that the relevant Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments are not also written down or converted.

For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Bank is unable to write down or convert any Prior Loss Absorbing

<<<

 Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments as aforesaid, the Write Down Amount determined in accordance with part (i) of the definition of "Write Down Amount" will be calculated on the basis that such Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments

<<<

 and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments are not available to be written down or converted, and accordingly the Write Down Amount determined in accordance with that part (i) will be higher than it would otherwise have been if such Prior Loss

<<<

 Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments had been available to be written down or converted.

7.4 Write Down Amount: "W rite Down Am ount" means, in respect of any Write Down, the amount by which the then Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amount of each Note (calculated per Calculation Amount) is to be Written Down, being the lower of (i) and (ii) below:

(i)

the amount per Note which is determined by the Bank to be necessary (in conjunction with (a)

the concurrent Write Down

<<<

 of the other Notes; and (b) the concurrent (or substantially

concurrent) write-down or conversion into equity of, or other loss absorption measures taken in

respect of, any other Prior Loss Absorbing Instruments and/or Parity Loss Absorbing

<<<



Instruments, in each case in the manner and to the extent provided in Condition 7.3 (Prior Loss

Absorbing Instruments and Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments)) to restore each of the Bank's,

the Bank Group's and/or (subject to Condition 7

<<<

.10) the DNB Group's (as applicable) CET1

Ratio to at least 5.125 per cent. (and so that the lowest of such CET1 Ratios is equal to (or as

near as is practicable equal to but not less than) 5.125 per cent.); and

(ii) the amount necessary

<<<

 to reduce the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note to one cent per Calculation Amount (and references herein to the "one cent floor" in respect of the Notes shall be construed accordingly).

The Outstanding Principal Amount of a Note shall

<<<

 not at any time be reduced below one cent per Calculation Amount as a result of a Write Down.

7.5 Full Loss Absorbing Instruments: If, in connection with the Write Down or the calculation of the Write Down Amount, there are outstanding any

<<<

 Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments the terms of which provide that they shall be written down or converted into equity in full and not in part only ("Full Loss Absorbing Instrum ents") then:

(i) the requirement that a Write Down of the Notes

<<<

 shall be effected pro rata with the write-down or conversion into equity, as the case may be, of any Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments shall not be construed as requiring the Notes to be Written Down in full (or in full save for the one cent

<<<

 floor) simply by virtue of the fact that such Full Loss Absorbing Instruments will be written-down or converted in full; and

48

(ii) for the purposes of calculating the Write Down Amount, the Full Loss Absorbing Instruments will be treated

<<<

 (for the purposes only of determining the write-down of principal or conversion into equity, as the case may be, among the Notes and such other Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments on a pro rata basis) as if their terms permitted partial write

<<<

-down or conversion into equity, such that the write-down or conversion into equity of such Full Loss Absorbing Instruments shall be deemed to occur in two concurrent stages: (a) first, the principal amount of such Full Loss Absorbing Instruments

<<<

 shall be written-down or converted into equity pro rata with the Notes and all other Parity Loss Absorbing Instruments to the extent necessary to restore each of the Bank's, the Bank Group's and/or (subject to Condition 7.10) the DNB Group

<<<

's (as the case may be) CET1 Ratio to at least 5.125 per cent.; and (b) secondly, the balance (if any) of the principal amount of such Full Loss Absorbing Instruments remaining following (a) shall be written-off or converted into equity, as

<<<

 the case may be, with the effect of increasing the Bank's, the Bank Group's and/or the DNB Group's, as the case may be, CET1 Ratio above the minimum required level under (a) above.

7.6 Interest accrual: Following a reduction of the Outstanding

<<<

 Principal Amount of the Notes as described above, interest will accrue on the reduced Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note from (and including) the relevant Write Down Date, and (for the avoidance of doubt) such interest will be subject

<<<

 to Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption following a Trigger Event).

7.7 Write Down may occur on one or more occasion; No default: A Write Down may occur on one or more occasions and accordingly the Notes may

<<<

 be Written Down on one or more occasions (provided however, for the avoidance of doubt, that the principal amount of a Note shall not at any time be reduced to below one cent per Calculation Amount). Any reduction of the Outstanding Principal

<<<

 Amount pursuant to Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event) shall not constitute a default by the Bank under the Notes or for any purpose.

7.8 Cancellation not automatic: If the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes is Written

<<<

 Down to one cent per Calculation Amount, the Notes will not be automatically cancelled.

7.9 Currency: For the purposes of any calculation in connection with a Write Down or Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes which necessarily requires

<<<

 the determination of a figure in the Accounting Currency (or in an otherwise consistent manner across obligations denominated in different currencies), including (without limitation) any determination of a Write Down Amount and/or a Maximum

<<<

 Write-up Amount, any relevant obligations (including the Notes) which are not denominated in the Accounting Currency shall, (for the purposes of such calculation only) be deemed notionally to be converted into the Accounting Currency at the

<<<

 foreign exchange rates determined, in the sole discretion of the Bank, to be applicable based on its regulatory reporting requirements under Applicable Banking Regulations.

7.10 Fall away o fDNB Group Trigger:

(i)

If at any time the Bank

<<<

 is no longer required to treat the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group falling

below 5.125 per cent. as a Trigger Event, as notified to the Bank by the Norwegian FSA, the

Bank will, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 10 Business

<<<

 Days of being

so notified by the Norwegian FSA), give notice of the same to the Holders in accordance with

Condition 17 (Notices). With effect from the date of such notice, the CET1 Ratio of the DNB

Group falling below 5.125 per cent. will

<<<

 cease to constitute a Trigger Event and the definition of

Trigger Event shall, from such time, be construed accordingly.

(ii) The notice to Holders given under Condition 7.10(i) above shall be irrevocable, and in no circumstances thereafter

<<<

 will the Bank be entitled (except with the consent of the Holders in accordance with Condition 16 (Meetings o f Holders; Modification)) to reinstate the CET1 Ratio of the DNB Group falling below 5.125 per cent. (or any other level) as a Trigger

<<<

 Event.

49

(iii) With effect from the date of the notice referred to in Condition 7.10(i), and in addition to the amendment to "Trigger Event" as provided in Condition 7.10(i), the following expressions in these Conditions shall also be deemed

<<<

 to be amended as follows:

"Full Loss Absorbing Instrum ent" : The reference in Condition 7.5(ii) to the DNB Group's CET1 Ratio shall be deemed to be deleted;

"Prior Loss Absorbing Instrum ent" : The reference to the DNB Group's CET1 Ratio

<<<

 shall be deemed to be deleted;

"Relevant Entity": The reference to the DNB Group shall be deemed to be deleted;

"Relevant Profits": The reference to the Net Profit of the DNB Group shall be deemed to be deleted;

"W rite Down Am ount": The

<<<

 reference in Condition 7.4(i) to the DNB Group's CET1 Ratio shall be deemed to be deleted; and

"W ritten-Down Additional Tier 1 Instrum ents": The reference to relevant Additional Tier 1 Capital of the DNB Group shall be deemed to be deleted

<<<

.

8.

Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes

8.1 Discretionary Reinstatement o f the Notes: If, at any time while any Note remains Written Down, each Relevant Entity records a positive Net Profit, the Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion

<<<

, increase the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes (a "Discretionary Reinstatem ent") by such amount (calculated per Calculation Amount) as the Bank may elect, provided that such Discretionary Reinstatement shall not:

(i) result in the

<<<

 Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes being greater than their Original Principal Amount;

(ii) result in the occurrence of a Trigger Event; or

(iii) result in the Maximum Write-up Amount to be exceeded when taken together with the aggregate

<<<

 of:

(a) any previous Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes out of the same Relevant Profits since the Reference Date (if any);

(b) the aggregate amount of any interest on the Notes that has been paid or calculated (but disregarding any

<<<

 such calculated interest which has been cancelled) since the Reference Date on the basis of an Outstanding Principal Amount that is lower than the Original Principal Amount;

(c) the aggregate amount of the increase in principal amount of the

<<<

 Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments to be written-up out of the same Relevant Profits concurrently (or substantially concurrently) with the Discretionary Reinstatement and (if applicable) any previous increase in principal amount out

<<<

 of the same Relevant Profits of such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments since the Reference Date; and

(d) the aggregate amount of any interest on such Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments that have been paid or calculated (but

<<<

 disregarding any such calculated interest which has been cancelled) since the Reference Date on the basis of a prevailing principal amount that is lower than the original principal amount at which such WrittenDown Additional Tier 1 Instruments

<<<

 were issued.

50

A Discretionary Reinstatement will also not be effected in circumstances in which it would cause any Maximum Distributable Amount then applicable to the Bank, the Bank Group and/or (unless no longer required by the Norwegian

<<<

 FSA) the DNB Group to be exceeded.

8.2 Notice o f Discretionary Reinstatement: In the event of a Discretionary Reinstatement in accordance with Condition 8.1 (Discretionary Reinstatement o f the Notes), the Bank will give notice to Holders

<<<

 in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) and to the Fiscal Agent not more than ten business days following the day on which it resolves to effect such Discretionary Reinstatement, which notice shall specify the amount of such Discretionary

<<<

 Reinstatement (expressed per Calculation Amount or as a percentage) and the date on which such Discretionary Reinstatement will be effected.

8.3 Write-up o f Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments: Any Discretionary Reinstatement shall

<<<

 be applied concurrently (or substantially concurrently) and pro rata with other write-ups to be effected out of the Relevant Profits in respect of any Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instruments.

The Bank will not reinstate the principal amount

<<<

 of any Written-Down Additional Tier 1 Instrument that have terms permitting a write-up of such principal amount to occur out of the Relevant Profits on a similar basis to that set out in respect of the Notes unless it does so on a pro rata

<<<

 basis with a Discretionary Reinstatement of the Notes.

8.4 Interest Accrual: Following a Discretionary Reinstatement in respect of the Notes, interest will accrue on the increased Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note from (and including

<<<

) the date on which the relevant Discretionary Reinstatement takes effect, and (for the avoidance of doubt) such interest will be subject to Condition 6 (Interest Cancellation) and Condition 7.1 (Loss Absorption following a Trigger Event).


<<<


8.5 Discretionary Reinstatement may occur on one or more occasions: A Discretionary Reinstatement may occur on one or more occasions until the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes has been reinstated to the Original Principal Amount. Any

<<<

 decision by the Bank to effect or not to effect any Discretionary Reinstatement on any occasion shall not preclude it from effecting or not effecting any Discretionary Reinstatement on any other occasion.

For the avoidance o f doubt, Discretionary

<<<

 Reinstatement shall apply to the Notes only if, and to the extent that, the Notes have been Written Down following the occurrence o f a Trigger Event in accordance with the provisions o f Condition 7 (Loss Absorption Following a Trigger Event

<<<

) above. I f at any time the Notes are written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act, the principal amount by which the Notes are written down pursuant to the Bank Security Act shall not be reinstated (whether by way o f Discretionary Reinstatement

<<<

 or otherwise) in any circumstances, and references in these Conditions to a Discretionary Reinstatement up to (or not exceeding) the Original Principal Amount o f the Notes shall be construed as i f the Original Principal Amount had been reduced

<<<

 by an amount equal to the principal amount o f the Notes written down under the Bank Security Act.

9.

Redemption and Purchase

9.1 No maturity: The Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for redemption. The Bank may only redeem

<<<

 the Notes at its discretion in the circumstances described herein. The Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Holders at any time.

Regulatory Capital Ratios

The Issuer and the DNB Group intend to publish information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of the Issuer, the Bank Group and the DNB Group as part of their financial statements each quarter.

Up until 3

<<<

0 June 2014, the DNB Group followed the Basel II regulations for capital adequacy calculations. On 22 August 2014, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance approved changes in a number of capital adequacy regulations. Parallel to this, Finanstilsynet

<<<

 changed the Consolidation Regulations to adapt to the EU's new capital adequacy regulations for banks and investment firms (CRD IV/CRR). As of 30 September 2014, capital adequacy will be reported in accordance with the new reporting requirements

<<<

. Valuation rules used in the statutory accounts form the basis for the consolidation, which is subject to special consolidation rules governed by the Consolidation Regulations.

The table below sets out the Issuer's, the Bank Group's and the

The B ank's strategy
The Bank is the main unit in DNB Group, and the Bank's strategy is thus clearly

<<<

 co-ordinated with the DNB Group's overall strategy.
DNB's strategy
DNB Group's strategic platform consists of the DNB Group's vision and values and a shared customer value proposition.
DNB Group's vision and values are about putting the customers

<<<

 in focus. By having satisfied customers whose need for financial services are well met, DNB Group aims to be the leading bank throughout Norway and a leading international player within selected customer segments, products and geographic areas

<<<

.
The strategy focuses on capital efficiency, customer experience and corporate culture.
Capital Efficiency
DNB Group will give priority to growth within the areas which ensure the best risk-adjusted return, with special emphasis on non-capital

<<<

 intensive products and services.
Customer Experience
DNB Group wishes to ensure that customers have a good experience every time they are in contact with the bank. Innovation and development and good access to the DNB Group's services are key

<<<

 elements in this respect. DNB Group will show initiative, build trust and make sure that the size of the DNB Group is advantageous for its customer. This is underlined by DNB Group's customer value proposition: "Here for you. Every day. When

<<<

 it matters the most."
Good customer experiences, along with local competitive power and in-depth industry knowledge, is important to consolidate and strengthen DNB Group's position among customers.
Corporate Culture
DNB Group's operational

<<<

 structure reflects the DNB Group's customer segments and aims to ensure efficient adaption to changes in customer behaviour and the development of products and services tailored to the needs of the various customer segments. DNB Group's corporate

<<<

 culture should be characterized by change capacity, engagement, good leadership and effective communication. Close cooperation between the various group units will ensure that customers get access to the DNB Group's full range of services.

<<<


Operational structure - DNB Group
The operational structure of DNB Group deviates from its legal structure. The operational structure is adapted to the DNB Group's business operations and aims to ensure high-quality customer service and products

<<<

 as well as efficient operations.
Customer areas are responsible for customer relationships and customer service, while product areas are responsible for the development of key products. Operational tasks and group services are carried out by

<<<

 the DNB Group's support and staff units, which provide infrastructure and cost-efficient services for the business units. All activities in the subsidiaries fall within the area relevant to such subsidiaries' primary operations.

Reporting

<<<

 structure DNB G roup- Business segments

Financial governance in DNB is geared to the different customer segments. The follow-up of total customer relationships and segment profitability are two important dimensions when making strategic priorities

<<<

 and deciding where to allocate the DNB Group's resources. Special product areas are responsible for production and development for parts of the product range and for ensuring that the DNB Group meets the needs of the various customer segments

<<<

. Reported figures for the different segments, as further described below, will reflect the DNB Group's total sales of products and services to the relevant customer segments.

Personal customers -

this segment includes the DNB Group's 2.1

<<<

 million personal customers in Norway. The segment includes the DNB Group's total products and activities to private customers in all channels, both digital and physical. The DNB Group offers a wide range of products through Norway's largest

<<<

 distribution network, comprising branches, telephone banking (24/7), digital banking, real estate broking as well as external channels (post offices and in-store postal and banking outlets).

Pre-tax operating profits totalled NOK 2,560 million

<<<

 in the fourth quarter of 2014, down NOK 29 million from the fourth quarter of 2013.. Pre-tax operating profit for the full year 2014 amounted to NOK 9,795. Average loans to customers (including accrued interest, impairment and value adjustments

<<<

) amounted to NOK 684 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. A large share of loans to personal customers represents wellsecured home mortgages.

The market share of credit to households stood at 26.1 per cent at endNovember 2014, while market

<<<

 share of total household savings was 32.4 per cent. DNB Eiendom had a market share of 19.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Small and medium-sized enterprises -

this segment is responsible for product sales and advisory services to

<<<

 small and medium-sized enterprises in Norway. The DNB Group aspires to be a local bank for the whole of Norway, while offering the products and expertise of a large bank. Customers in the segment range from small businesses and start-up companies

<<<

 to relatively large corporate customers, and the product offerings are adapted to the customers' different needs. Small and medium-sized enterprises are served through the DNB Group's large physical distribution network throughout Norway as

<<<

 well as digital and telephone banking (24/7).

Pre-tax operating profits amounted to NOK 893 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of NOK 71 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in profits reflected a strong rise

<<<

 in both net

65

interest income and net other operating income. Pre-tax operating profit for the full year 2014 amounted to NOK 3,551.

The DNB Group is committed to supporting customers who want to start their own business and is working

<<<

 on measures that will help newly established companies streamline their business activities.

Large corporates and international customers -

the segment includes large Norwegian and international corporate customers including all customers

<<<

 in the Baltics and Poland. Operations are based on sound industry expertise and long-term customer relationships.

Pre-tax operating profits came to NOK 2,825 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a reduction of NOK 64 million from the year

<<<

-earlier period. In spite of healthy rise in income, profits were negatively affected by increasing impairment losses on loans. The pre-tax operating profit for the full year 2014 amounted to NOK 10,914.

The DNB Group gives priority to strong

<<<

, long-term profitable customer relationships and on further developing key customer segments. The Bank Group's wide range of products and broad expertise are key elements in efforts to strengthen customer relationships and form the basis for

<<<

 operations over the coming years.

Traditional pension products -

This segment comprises the portfolio of traditional defined-benefit pension products in DNB Livsforsikring. DNB no longer offers such products to new customers. Pre-tax operating

<<<

 profits totalled NOK 312 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a reduction of NOK 89 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. The pre-tax operating profit for the full year 2014 amounted to NOK 1,212 million. The prolonged low interest rate

<<<

 level and increased reserves to reflect higher life expectancy will put pressure on life insurance companies' earnings. DNB Livsforsikring is thus adapting its operations to the new regulatory framework by taking a conservative approach in

<<<

 its asset management operations and winding up the company's public sector operations as well as the sale of defined-benefit pensions.

Trading -

includes market making and other trading activities in fixed income, currencies and commodities

<<<

 (FICC) as well as equities, including risk management of the risk inherent in customer transactions. Markets' trading activities support the customer activities.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, there was a pre-tax operating loss of NOK 105

<<<

 million, representing a reduction in profit of NOK 709 million from the year-earlier period. Lower oil prices and greater uncertainty regarding the Norwegian economy resulted in a depreciation of the Norwegian krone, reduced prices on Norwegian

<<<

 Treasury bills and widening credit spreads towards the end of 2014. Consequently, income declined to NOK 26 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, from 688 million in the year-earlier period.

<<<

 of its share capital denominated in SGD (due to local requirements) and a part of its share capital denominated in USD. 2) DNB Capital LLC, a limited liability company, has paid-in capital of USD 2.4 billion.
Risk Measurement and Risk-adjusted

<<<

 Capital
Risk-adjusted capital is a measure of the risk of losses generated by various business operations. Risk-adjusted capital makes it possible to compare risk across risk categories. Average losses over a normal business cycle represent

<<<

 expected costs which should primarily be covered through correct pricing. Risk-adjusted capital should cover unexpected losses. Calculations of risk-adjusted capital are based on statistical methods. However, calculations of risk-adjusted capital

<<<

 require a certain level of discretion and estimation, which could, if changed, have an impact on capital estimates.
DNB Group quantifies risk-adjusted capital for the following risk categories: credit risk, market risk, market risk in life

<<<

 insurance, insurance risk, risk in non-life insurance, operational risk and business risk. Risk-adjusted capital for the various risk categories is calculated separately as well as for the DNB Group as a whole. In addition, riskadjusted capital

<<<

 is calculated for all business areas. Calculations are used in profitability measurement and as decision support within risk management.

67

Risk Appetite
The risk appetite concept is an industry best practice enabling organisations to include

<<<

 risk as part of planning and strategy processes and thus react more swiftly to changing surroundings. DNB Group's risk appetite framework will represent an operationalisation of the DNB Group's current risk policy and guidelines, ensuring that

<<<

 risk is managed and integrated with other key steering processes in the organisation in a practical, structured, transparent and synchronised manner.
DNB Group's risk appetite framework consists of different risk appetite statements covering

<<<

 the risk dimensions considered to be significant for the DNB Group, and which added up give a good view of the total risk. The risk appetite statements set defined reference points against which the risk consequences of the organisation's strategic

<<<

 and financial planning should be evaluated. The statements have been formulated along the dimensions of profitability and earnings, capitalisation, market risk, insurance risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational

<<<

 risk
The DNB Group-level limits will be cascaded to business and support unit level. This is important to ensure that the risk appetite statements become more tangible and relevant in both strategy and planning processes as well as in day-to

<<<

-day operations at business unit level.
To support the framework a set of governance principles and operational procedures and responsibilities within the DNB Group have been developed. These are vital to ensure that risk appetite contributes

<<<

 to risk being managed and integrated with other key steering processes in DNB Group, while still maintaining the required independence to function as a reference point for risk consequences of the organisation's strategic and financial planning

<<<

.
A governance principal is that ownership of the framework must rest with the Board of Directors. All changes to the framework and the governance principles are to be approved by the Board of Directors. The risk appetite framework is also to

<<<

 be reviewed at least once a year in a process initiated by the DNB Group's chief risk officer. The annual review is to take place independent of the strategic and financial planning process. There will be monthly reporting of actual risk exposure

<<<

 within the DNB Group. Based on this reporting structure there are pre defined procedures for following up and handling risks that are approaching critical levels vis-a-vis the risk appetite statements, and for risk elements that may have exceeded

<<<

 such levels. Each risk appetite statement is also to be assigned an owner within the administration who will be responsible for follow-up if risk levels are exceeded.
Risk Management
The primary aim of risk management in DNB Group is to achieve

<<<

 an optimal balance between the DNB Group's risk of losses and its earnings potential in a long-term perspective. Risk management implies that profitability is considered relative to risk, while ensuring that the DNB Group is secured against

<<<

 unintentional risk.
Healthy risk management is based on a strong risk culture, which is characterised by a high level of awareness concerning risk and risk management in the organisation. A common risk management framework provides the basis

<<<

 for developing a sound culture and for effective management of the DNB Group.
Risk categories
In DNB Group, risk is divided into different categories which are subject to special measurements and management.
Credit risk
Credit risk (or counterparty

<<<

 risk) is the risk of financial losses due to failure on the part of the DNB Group's customers (counterparties) to meet their payment obligations towards DNB Group. Credit risk refers to all claims against customers/counterparties, principally

<<<

 loans, but also obligations related to other approved credits, guarantees, fixed-income securities, undrawn credits and interbank deposits, as well as counterparty risk incurred in connection with trading in currency and interest rate derivatives

<<<

. In addition, there are significant elements of counterparty risk in the settlement risk which arises in connection with payment transfers and the settlement of contracts. Credit risk also includes concentration risk, including risk associated

<<<

 with large exposures to one and
68

the same customer, concentration within a geographic area or industry or exposures to homogeneous customer groups. Residual risk is the risk that the collateral provided for a credit exposure fails to meet

<<<

 expectations.
DNB Group's credit process is based on the DNB Group's credit policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The primary aim of credit operations is to maintain a credit portfolio with a composition and quality that ensures

<<<

 the bank's short and long-term profitability. The quality of the credit portfolio should be consistent with DNB's low risk profile target.
The DNB Group aims to avoid large risk concentrations, including large exposures to a customer or customer

<<<

 group as well as clusters of commitments in high-risk categories, industries and geographical areas. Developments in risk concentrations are monitored closely with respect to volume, risk category and risk-adjusted capital. Exposures to large

<<<

 customers and customer groups are followed up based on risk category and risk-adjusted capital.
The risk classification systems are used as decision support and for continual risk monitoring and reporting. Probability of default, expected losses

<<<

 and risk-adjusted capital for commitments on an individual and portfolio basis are an integral part of the credit process and ongoing monitoring, including the follow-up of credit strategies.
Market risk Market risk is the risk of losses due

<<<

 to unhedged positions in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. The risk arises in consequence of fluctuations in profits due to changes in market prices or exchange rates. Market risk includes both risk that arises

<<<

 through ordinary trading activities and risk that arises as part of banking activities. The DNB Group is also exposed to substantial market risk in the insurance operations, in particular in the life insurance company DNB Livforsikring ASA

<<<

.
Market risk in life insurance is the risk that the return on financial assets will not be sufficient to meet the obligations specified in insurance policies.
Insurance risk Insurance risk is incurred by DNB Livsforsikring ASA and DNB Skadeforsikring

<<<

 ASA and is related to changes in future insurance obligations. Within life insurance, such risk reflects changes in life expectancy and disability rates. Within non-life insurance, insurance risk is related to the frequency and size of future

<<<

 claims payments.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the DNB Group will be unable to meet its obligations as they fall due, and the risk that the DNB Group will be unable to meet its liquidity obligations without a substantial rise

<<<

 in appurtenant costs. Liquidity is vital to financial operations though this risk category will often be conditional in the respect that it will not materialise until other events give rise to concern regarding the DNB Group's ability to meet

<<<

 its obligations. Liquidity risk is not quantified in the form of risk-adjusted capital but is followed up through limit management and stress tests.
Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of losses due to deficiencies or errors in processes

<<<

 and systems, errors made by employees or external events.
Operational risk is a risk category which covers most costs associated with shortcomings in the quality of the DNB Group's operations. As for other risk categories, DNB Group aims to

<<<

 document low risk and high quality. Thus, great emphasis is placed on risk and quality in the operation and management of the DNB Group. Special sections have been established in all business areas and support units, carrying responsibility

<<<

 for the practical aspects of operational risk management.
Contingency and business continuity plans are central tools in operational risk management and subject to continual quality control.
69

Business risk Business risk relates to fluctuations

<<<

 in profits due to changes in external factors such as the market situation, government regulations or the loss of income due to a weakened reputation. Reputational risk is often a consequence of other risk categories. The DNB Group's business

<<<

 risk is primarily handled through the strategy process and ongoing efforts to safeguard and improve the DNB Group's reputation. When determining and following up the DNB Group's risk appetite, reputational risk is defined as a separate risk

<<<

 dimension. In addition to the risks described above, the DNB Group is exposed to strategic risk, which can be defined as the risk of a decline in profits if the DNB Group fails to exploit existing strategic opportunities. The DNB Group's strategic

<<<

 risk is not measured or reported individually, but is discussed as part of the annual strategy process.

Supervisory Board

Responsibility and organisation

The Issuer has a supervisory board

<<<

 ("Supervisory Board") which is in accordance with the Norwegian Financial Institutions Act and the Issuer's articles of association. The Supervisory Board consists of 30 members with 10 to 20 deputies, 20 members elected by the shareholders

<<<

 and 10 members elected by the employees. The members of the Supervisory Board are elected for two-year terms.

71

The Supervisory Board annually elects its chairman and vice-chairman from among its members. The current chairman is Eldbjørg

<<<

 Løwer and the current vice-chairman is Randi Eek Thorsen.

The main responsibility of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the Board of Directors of the Issuer (the "Board of Directors") and the chief executive officer's ("CEO") management

<<<

 of the Issuer. The Supervisory Board must also submit a statement to the Issuer's general meeting of shareholders on whether the Issuer's Board of Directors' proposal for the income statement and balance sheet should be approved, as well as

<<<

 on the Board of Directors' proposal for allocation of the profit or loss cover. Pursuant to the Issuer's articles of association, the Supervisory Board elects the board members and deputies (including the chairman and the vice-chairman), the

<<<

 election committee and the external auditor and determines their remuneration. The Supervisory Board also determines the remuneration of the CEO. Furthermore the Supervisory Board has established the guidelines for the Control Committee (as

TAXATION
Prospective purchasers o fNotes are advised to consult their tax advisers as to the tax consequences under the tax laws

<<<

 o f the country o f which they are resident o f a purchase o f Notes, including, but not limited to, the consequences o f receipts o f interest and sale or redemption o fNotes.
The following descriptions are general summaries o f certain taxation

<<<

 matters based on applicable law and practice currently in effect in the relevant jurisdictions. Nothing in this section constitutes tax, legal or financial advice, and the summaries contained herein are o f a general nature and do not cover

<<<

 all aspects of taxation in the relevant jurisdictions that may be relevant to any particular holder o f Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their professional advisers on the tax implications for them o f an investment

<<<

 in the Notes.
NORWEGIAN TAXATION
Payments of principal and interest on the Notes issued to persons who have no connection with Norway other than the holding of such Notes issued by the Issuer are, under present Norwegian law, not subject to

<<<

 Norwegian tax, and may hence be made without any withholding tax or deduction for any Norwegian taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges.
Capital gains or profits realised on the sale, disposal or redemption of such Notes by persons

<<<

 who have no connection with Norway other than the holding of the Notes are not, under present Norwegian law, subject to Norwegian taxes or duties.
No Norwegian issue tax or stamp duty is payable in connection with the issues of the Notes.
The

<<<

 Notes will not be subject to any Norwegian estate duties.
Persons considered domiciled in Norway for tax purposes will be subject to Norwegian income tax of a flat rate of 27 per cent. on interest received in respect of the Notes. Likewise

<<<

, capital gains or profits realised by such persons on the sale, disposal or redemption of the Notes will be subject to Norwegian taxation.
IRELAND TAXATION
THE FOLLOW ING IS A SUMMARY BASED ON THE LAWS AND PRACTICES CURRENTLY IN FORCE IN IRELAND

<<<

 OF IRISH WITHHOLDING TAX ON INTEREST AND ADDRESSES THE TAX POSITION OF INVESTORS WHO ARE THE ABSOLUTE BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF THE NOTES. PARTICULAR RULES NOT DISCUSSED BELOW MAY APPLY TO CERTAIN CLASSES OF TAXPAYERS HOLDING NOTES, INCLUDING DEALERS

<<<

 IN SECURITIES AND TRUSTS. THE SUMMARY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE AND THE COMMENTS BELOW ARE OF A GENERAL NATURE ONLY AND IT DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF IRISH TAXATION THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO ANY PARTICULAR HOLDER OF NOTES.

<<<

 PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS IN THE NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR PROFESSIONAL ADVISERS ON THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF THE PURCHASE, HOLDING, REDEMPTION OR SALE OF THE NOTES AND THE RECEIPT OF PAYMENTS THEREON UNDER THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE

<<<

, CITIZENSHIP OR DOMICILE.
Withholding Tax
Tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.) is required to be withheld from payments of Irish source interest. The Issuer will not be obliged to withhold Irish income tax from payments

<<<

 of interest on the Notes so long as such payments do not constitute Irish source income. Interest paid on the Notes may be treated as having an Irish source if:
a) the Issuer is resident in Ireland for tax purposes; or
76

b) the Issuer has

<<<

 a branch or permanent establishment in Ireland, the assets or income of which is used to fund the payments on the Notes; or
c) the Issuer is not resident in Ireland for tax purposes but the register for the Notes is maintained in Ireland or

<<<

 (if the Notes are in bearer form) the Notes are physically held in Ireland.
It is anticipated that, (i) the Issuer is not and will not be resident in Ireland for tax purposes; (ii) the Issuer will not have a branch or permanent establishment

<<<

 in Ireland; (iii) payments under the Notes will not be derived from Irish sources or assets; (iv) bearer Notes will not be physically located in Ireland and the Issuer will not maintain a register of any registered Notes in Ireland.
Encashment

<<<

 Tax
In certain circumstances, Irish tax will be required to be withheld at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.) on any interest, dividends or annual payments payable out of or in respect of the stocks, funds, shares or securities

<<<

 of a company not resident in Ireland, where such interest, dividends or annual payments are collected or realised by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland for payment to any person who is Irish resident.
Encashment tax does not apply where

<<<

 the holder of the Notes is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration in the prescribed form to the encashment agent or bank.
EU SAVINGS DIRECTIVE
Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are

<<<

 required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest (or similar income) paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another

<<<

 Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State.
On 24 March, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member

<<<

 States are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January, 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The changes will also

<<<

 expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts

<<<

) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.
For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during

<<<

 that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which still operate a withholding

<<<

 system when they are implemented.
The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and territories including

<<<

 Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).
THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL TRANSACTION TAX
On 24 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive

<<<

 for a common financial transaction tax ("FTT") in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States").
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could

<<<

, if introduced apply to certain dealings in financial instruments (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are exempt.
Under

<<<

 the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes where at least
77

one party is a financial

<<<

 institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting

<<<

 with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State. Joint statements issued by participating Member States indicate an intention

<<<

 to implement the FTT by 1 January 2016. However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and the scope of any such tax is uncertain. Additional European Union Member States may decide to participate

<<<

. Prospective holders o f Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
