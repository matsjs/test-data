2. BACKGROUND
On 25 February 2013, the Company issued Initial Bonds to the Bondholders in an aggregate principal amount of USD 20,000,000. The proceeds of the issue of Initial

 Bonds were applied, inter alia, to fund the purchase of the Vessel by means of a judicial private treaty sale in Gibraltar and in order to fund the working capital requirements of the Newco Group. On 23 July 2013, the Company issued Additional

<<<

 Bonds to the Bondholders in an aggregate principal amount of USD 8,250,000 by means of a tap issuance in accordance with Clause 2.5 of the Loan Agreement.
As a result, the total principal amount of Bonds issued pursuant to the Loan Agreement

<<<

 as of the date of this Summons is USD 28,750,000. The proceeds of the tap issuance were used to fund additional working capital requirements of the Newco Group and, in particular, to fund repair and improvement works to the Vessel. Pursuant

<<<

 to Clause 2.5 of the Loan Agreement, the Company has headroom to issue further Additional Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of USD 1,250,000.
The current status of the Vessel is that it has completed the scope of work planned during the

 (in excess of USD 1,250,000) in order to cover the Vessel's future working capital requirements. In order to address this funding request, the Company has proposed to amend the Loan Agreement as set out below.

3. AMENDMENT TO BOND AGREEMENT

<<<



In order to create further headroom under the Loan Agreement, the Company proposes to amend Clause 2.5 of the Loan Agreement to increase the aggregate principal amount of Additional Bonds from USD 10 million to USD 34 million, thereby increasing

<<<

 the aggregate principal amount of Bonds that may be issued under the Loan Agreement from USD 30 million to USD 54 million (the "Amendment"). The Company proposes to document the Amendment pursuant to an Amendment Agreement to the Loan Agreement

 (the "Amendment Agreement").

Once the Amendment has been made by entering into the Amendment Agreement, the Company intends to issue Additional Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of approximately USD 8,750,000 to the Bondholders in order

<<<

 to raise additional funds to cover the Vessel's future working capital requirements.
