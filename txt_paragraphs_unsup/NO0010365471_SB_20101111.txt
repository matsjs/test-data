1 036547.1 - Rocksource ASA Senior Secured Callable and Putable Bond Issue 2007/2012

Oslo, 11 November 2010
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee" or "NTM") is appointed as loan trustee for the above mentioned

<<<

 bond issue (the "Loan") with a total outstanding amount of NOK 200 000 000, which is issued by Rocksource ASA (the "Borrower" or "Rocksource").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement

<<<

 dated 3 May 2007 (the "Loan Agreement") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.
The information in this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions is provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly

<<<

 disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1. BACKGROUND
The Borrower has received a bid for its US onshore activities, which consist of fields in San Jacinto and Polk Counties, Texas. The fields have been classified as

<<<

 non-core by the Borrower, and a sale of these assets would allow the Borrower to re-allocate the proceeds into the Borrower's core business; drilling high potential EM positive offshore exploration wells.
According to the Borrower, the value

<<<

 of the US onshore assets as collateral at the maturity of the Loan in May 2012 will be limited. Hence, the Borrower argues that the optimal solution is to sell the assets now and amend the Loan Agreement as described below as this will capture

<<<

 the maximum value for both the Borrower and the Bondholders.

2. PROPOSAL
The Borrower puts forward the following proposed amendments to the terms of the Loan (the "Proposal"):
a) All security related to REC, Sandhawk and the REC Assets are

<<<

 released.
b) Rocksource shall redeem a part of the Loan equal to 25% of the gross sales proceeds from a sale of Sandhawk or the REC Assets within 10 banking days from

consummation of such sale and receipt of the sales proceeds. The partial

<<<

 redemption shall be carried out at 100% of the face value (par) plus accrued interest, and shall be carried out pro-rata between the Bondholders. To facilitate the pro-rata redemption, each Bond with a face value of NOK 500 000 shall be split

<<<

 into 500 000 Bonds with a face value of NOK 1.
c) Rocksource shall provide new Loan Security in way of a first priority pledge in all shares in the Borrower's subsidiary Rocksource Gulf of Mexico Corporation and its holding company Rocksource

<<<

 Gulf of Mexico AS and any accounts receivables against these companies and between Rocksource Gulf of Mexico AS and Rocksource Gulf of Mexico Corporation.
d) The Proposal is conditional on that Rocksource and a bidder signs and consummates

<<<

 the sale of Sandhawk or REC Assets and the board of directors of Rocksource approves the sale of Sandhawk or the REC Assets, causing the current arbitration case in respect of REC, Sandhawk and the REC Assets to be settled as result of the

<<<

 sale.
e) Rocksource shall pay an additional 5 % of the gross sales proceeds from a sale of Sandhawk or the REC Assets at the maturity date of the Loan or earlier if the Borrower decides to exercise its Call Options as set out in the Loan Agreement

<<<

3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
3.1 The Borrower's evaluation
Rocksource was founded in 2004 and has spent recent years building a significant exploration and development portfolio. 2011 will represent a step change for the Borrower

<<<

, as the Borrower moves into the next phase - the drilling of high potential EM positive offshore exploration wells. With current equity stakes the Borrower estimates that it will test approximately 150 million barrels of oil equivalent ("Mboe

<<<

") of net risked resources in its first four firm exploration wells in 2011. In parallel, it will mature plans for commercialization of its circa 85 Mboe of discovered resources.
While the Borrower's US onshore assets (held through REC and Sandhawk

<<<

) were important in the build up phase of Rocksource, generating significant cash flow and enabling the Borrower to grow its core business, the fields are now on a natural decline. Coupled with a significant drop in US gas prices, the US assets

<<<

 have become increasingly marginal to the Borrower. This was reflected in the Borrower's Q2 2010 financial report, where the assets were written down by 16 MUSD to under 10 MUSD. Current production no longer contributes significant net cash

<<<

 to cover general and administrative costs (G&A) in the Group, which was the original aim behind the investment. On this background and with the Borrower approaching the drilling phase, the Borrower no longer recognizes its US assets as core

<<<

 business.
A sale of these assets would allow the Borrower to focus its business, reduce its G&A base and strengthen the financial position ahead of the upcoming drilling campaign embarking in Q1 2011.

NORSK TILU TSM AN N ASA

 'o .iK r
The Borrower has received a bid for its US assets amounting to 9.35 MUSD. The Borrower has also received lower bids in the 6-8 million USD range. The 9.35 MUSD bid, according to the Borrower, represents considerably higher value per

<<<

 boe than if the Borrower were to produce the volumes themselves. The Borrower states that based on current view of reserves, the bid indicates values in excess of USD 30 per boe, as compared to a forecasted operating cash flow (revenue - operating

<<<

 expenditure excluding G&A) of USD 13 per boe in 2011 if the Borrower were to produce the reserves themselves. The Borrower will also have significantly lower G&A following a potential sale.
The Borrower states the following:
· Due to natural

<<<

 decline reserves are estimated to fall by 65% from November 2010 to May 2012.
· Due to fixed production costs the cash flow is expected to fall even more. · Due to the low production and short commercial production `tail' post May 2012, the

<<<


interest from potential bidders at that time is expected to be marginal. · If a buyer could be found, a sale in May 2012 would probably yield a maximum price
of ~2.0 MUSD.
The value of the US onshore assets as collateral in May 2012 will hence

<<<

, according to the Borrower become limited. The Borrower therefore argues that the optimal solution is to sell the assets now for 9.35 MUSD as this will capture the maximum value for both the Borrower and the Bondholders.
The Borrower has not

<<<

 actively been marketing the US onshore fields due to a contractual dispute with the former owners of the assets. This dispute is due to go in front of an arbitration panel shortly. Even though the Borrower believes it has a strong case, there

<<<

 is always a risk that an arbitration case results in an adverse outcome for the Borrower. The counterparties in the arbitration participate in the 9.35 MUSD bid described in this document. In the event that the Borrower completes a sales and

<<<

 purchase agreement with the bidder, the arbitration will be terminated. As a part of the sale the counterparties in the arbitration proceeding will waive their claims and the dispute will be settled amicably without any payment from the Borrower

<<<

. In the event the arbitration takes place, the Borrower estimates total legal fees in excess of USD 500.000.
However, the shortfall of production due to the sale of Sandhawk or the REC Assets will negatively affect the company's free cash flow

<<<

 and ability to finance its exploration drilling in the period to the maturity of the Loan in May 2012. The Borrower will consequently only dispose of Sandhawk or the REC Assets in the event the Borrower retains the majority of the sale proceeds

<<<

 enhancing the Borrower's financial base prior to entering the exploration drilling phase.
According to the Borrower, the material value potential in its portfolio lies in its offshore exploration and development portfolio. The majority of the

<<<

 proceeds are therefore recommended to strengthen the Borrower's financial base ahead of its upcoming drilling campaign. The current 2011 drilling program will according to the Borrower expose the company to 150 Mboe net risked resources. The

<<<

 Borrower claims there is a significant follow up potential in the portfolio, with in excess of 1,000 Mboe in overall exploration potential.

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA

The Borrower states the company's competitive advantage lies

<<<

 in the exploration phase and as such it is fair to assume that the Borrower will create most value by allocation resources into the exploration portfolio.
The Borrower also has discovered fields within its Gulf of Mexico portfolio with discovered

<<<

 net resources of 85Mbbl (oil). Following a hiatus caused by the uncertainty generated by BP's "Macondo" incident this year, the Borrower plans to monetize these assets in 2011 to strengthen its balance sheet. A strategy it is likely to repeat

<<<

 with any initial discoveries from its 2011 drilling campaign.
Given this background, the Borrower proposes that the Borrower enters into a sales process with the bidder and that 75% of the proceeds from a sale of the US assets are retained

<<<

 by the Borrower and used for the above described purposes in order to enhance the Borrower's financial base. The Borrower shall consequently redeem a part of the Loan equal to 25% of the gross sales proceeds from a sale of US assets (Sandhawk

<<<

 or the REC Assets). According to the Borrower, this is in the interest of both the Borrower and the Bondholders.
The Borrower will also provide new Loan Security by way of first priority pledge in all shares in the Borrower's subsidiary Rocksource

<<<

 Gulf of Mexico Corporation and its holding company Rocksource Gulf of Mexico AS, and any accounts receivables against these companies and between Rocksource Gulf of Mexico AS and Rocksource Gulf of Mexico Corporation. Rocksource Gulf of Mexico

<<<

 Corporation has the following main assets:
· A diverse portfolio consisting of 17 deep water leases, including 2 discoveries · 13 leases owned 100%, others between 30 and 50% · Discovered, contingent resources of 85 Mboe net to Rocksource Gulf

<<<

 of Mexico · The total net unrisked exploration resource of 278 Mboe net to Rocksource Gulf of
Mexico · Rocksource's position acquired in 2009. Total invested capital by Rocksource: 20
MUSD · Full prospect de-risking with G&G and CSEM will be

<<<

 undertaken prior to drill
decisions
The Loan Agreement will otherwise remain unchanged, meaning that among other the provisions in clause 13.2 will still apply. Clause 13.2 among other states that neither Rocksource Gulf of Mexico AS nor Rocksource

<<<

 Gulf of Mexico Corporation may, unless consent is given by the bondholders, create any security interest on any asset or revenue (save any reserve based lending), or sell or dispose of operations or assets, excluding any farm-out agreements

<<<

, unless such sale or disposal is done in the ordinary course of business and on an arm's lengths basis.
The Proposal is conditional on that Rocksource and a bidder signs and consummates the sale of Sandhawk or REC Assets, the board of directors

<<<

 of Rocksource approves the sale of Sandhawk or the REC Assets, and that the current arbitration case in respect of REC, Sandhawk and the REC Assets is settled as result of the sale.
