<<<

 (the "Bond Trustee") is appointed as bond trustee for the bond issue with ISIN NO 001 070337.4 (the "Bonds") issued by Metro Exploration Holding Corp. (the "Issuer" or "Metro Ex") pursuant to the terms of the bond agreement (the "Bond Agreement

<<<

") dated 13 Februaty 2014 between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee.
All capitalised terms used but not defined in this summons have the meanings given to them in the Bond Agreement, unless otherwise stated.
The purpose o f this summons is to

<<<

 present to the Bondholders:
(i) Proposal A: a proposal for the distribution of cash currently sitting in the Issuer's direct subsidiary, Deep Sea Metro Ltd. ("DSM") and, in comiection with that distribution, a request that the Bondholders give

<<<

 their approval of a release of claims and liability; and
(ii) Proposal B: a proposal to amend the manner in which payments in respect o f the Bonds are applied in satisfaction of due and payable claims under the Bonds.
Proposal A and Proposal

<<<

 B will be subject to separate resolutions; accordingly; each Bondholder can cast independent votes in respect of Proposal A and Proposal B.
The Bondholders' Meeting is requested by the Issuer in accordance with clause 16 of the Bond Agreement

<<<

. Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons carefully and in its entirety.
1. Proposal A: Distribution and Release
Background The largest Bondholders have for some months been cooperating with the largest holders of the bonds issued by

<<<

 the Issuer's indirect subsidiaries, Golden Close Maritime Corp. Ltd. ("Golden Close") and Chloe Marine Corporation Ltd. ("Chloe Marine") with a view to working together to preserve their respective rights and interests and maximise their recoveries

<<<

 under the Bonds during a time of financial distress for the Issuer, Golden Close and Chloe Marine. During this period of cooperation, certain cash deposits have been retained in DSM's bank accounts (the "Cash").
In the first quarter 2016, the

<<<

 Bond Trustee, DSM, the Issuer (in its capacity as one of the shareholders in DSM) and the other shareholder in DSM, Odfjell Offshore Ltd. (the "Odfjell Shareholder") agreed in principle that DSM should distribute the Cash to its two shareholders

<<<

 (the Issuer and the Odfjell

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vils gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

Shareholder), in each case pro rata to that shareholder's percentage equity holding in DSM (i.e. 60% to the Issuer and 40% to the Odfjell

<<<

 Shareholder) (the "Distribution").
Distribution and Payment to Bondholders The amount of the Cash in DSM available for the Distribution is, as at the date of this summons, US$ 19,800,000, which would result in pro rata payments to the Issuer

<<<

 and the Odfjell Shareholder of US$ 11,880,000 and US$ 7,920,000, respectively (the amount so received by the Issuer being the "Issuer's Cash Portion"). It is intended that DSM would make the Distribution by 31 March 2016 at the latest.
Once

<<<

 the Issuer's Cash Portion has been received by the Issuer, it will, together with any other amounts standing to the credit of the Issuer's accounts (there being approximately US$ 4,090,000 standing to the credit of the Interest Reserve Account

<<<

 as at the date of this summons) and subject to the Retained Amount (as defined below), transfer that amount to the Bond Trustee for distribution to the Bondholders in partial satisfaction of, and pro rata to, their due and payable claims under

<<<

 the Bonds (the "Payment to Bondholders") (subject to the Payment Arrangements (as defined below in section 2), if they are adopted by the Bondholders' Meeting). The portion of the due and payable claims of the Bondholders not satisfied by the

<<<

 Payment to Bondholders would remain outstanding.
An amount will be retained by the Issuer from its available cash (following receipt of the Issuer's Cash Portion) for the purposes of satisfying (a) the general corporate expenses of the Issuer

<<<

 and its parent entities (all of which are under the ultimate control of the Bond Trustee (for and on behalf of the Bondholders)) (the Issuer and its parent entities together being the "Metro Ex Entities"), (b) the fees and expenses of the Bond

<<<

 Trustee and its advisers and (c) expenses that will be incurred in connection with the eventual wind-down of the Metro Ex Entities (when it becomes necessary or desirable to wind them down) (the "Retained Amount").
Release o f Claims Contingent

<<<

 upon the making of the Distribution, it was agreed between the Bond Trustee, the Issuer, the Odfjell Shareholder and DSM (in this context, the "Release Parties") to grant a mutual release of all claims and liability arising on whatever basis

<<<

 as between any of the Release Parties, up to the date of the release (the "Release"). The Release would not affect claims that the Bond Trustee may have against or in respect of Golden Close or Chloe Marine.
In order for the Distribution to

<<<

 be made as quickly as possible, the Bond Trustee and the other Release Parties have already entered into the agreement that constitutes the Release (the "Release Agreement"). The Release Agreement provides that its continuing effectiveness

<<<

 is conditional upon (a) the Distribution being made before 31 March 2016 and (b) the Bondholders formally approving the release in a Bondholders' Meeting.
In order to grant the Release, the Bond Trustee needed instructions to do so from Bondholders

<<<

 holding at least 2/3 of the Bonds. Bondholders holding more than 2/3 of the Bonds have already provided these instructions to the Bond Trustee and the Bond Trustee granted the Release on the strength of those instructions. However, it is necessary

<<<

 for the Bond Trustee's decision to enter into the Release Agreement to be ratified formally by a decision of the Bondholders in a Bondholders' Meeting (the "Ratification"). Accordingly, it is requested that the Bondholders approve the Ratification

<<<

.
2. Proposal B: Application of Payments in respect of the Bonds
Bondholders are requested to approve a proposal that provides for:
(a) all payments to be made in respect of due and payable claims of the Bondholders under the Bonds on and after

<<<

 the date of this summons, including, without limitation, the Payment to Bondholders (as defined above), to be applied in repayment of principal first (until all principal on the Bonds has been repaid), in priority to accrued but unpaid interest

<<<

;
2

(b) repayment of principal on the Bonds on and after the date of this summons at Face Value (and not with any premium); and
(c) on and after the date of this summons, a disapplication of any requirement to repay the Bonds in their entirety

<<<

 or with any call premium or otherwise in accordance with any timing or notification requirements established by clause 10 of the Bond Agreement,
and for the purposes of items (a) to (c) above, the Bondholders are further requested to approve

<<<

 a waiver of those provisions of the Bond Agreement (including, without limitation, provisions of clauses 10.1 and 10.2) that are contrary to the treatment of payments described in items (a) to (c) (the arrangements in this section 2 collectively

<<<

 being the "Payment Arrangements").
3. The Proposals
It is proposed that the Bondholders resolve to approve:
(a) proposal A ("Proposal A") to:
(i) acknowledge and approve the making of the Distribution and the Payment to Bondholders, subject

<<<

 to retention by the Issuer of the Retained Amount;
(ii) acknowledge and approve the Bond Trustee's entry into of the Release Agreement and the Ratification; and
(iii) instruct the Bond Trustee (in consultation with its advisers) to do all things

<<<

 and take such steps on behalf of the Bondholders as may be necessary or expedient in connection with, and for the purpose of implementing, the matters referred to in section 3(a)(i) and (ii) above, including, without limitation, negotiating

<<<

 and approving the final terms of, and entering into, any and all documentation and agreements deemed necessary or desirable by the Bond Trustee; and/or
(b) proposal B ("Proposal B") to:
(i) acknowledge and approve the Payment Arrangements;

<<<

 and

<<<

, including, without limitation, negotiating and approving the final terms of, and entering into, any and all documentation and agreements deemed necessary or desirable by the Bond Trustee.
4. Non-reliance
Proposal A and Proposal B are put forward

<<<

 to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee and nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate Proposal A and Proposal

<<<

 B and vote accordingly. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal, financial and tax advisers regarding the effect of Proposal A and Proposal B.
