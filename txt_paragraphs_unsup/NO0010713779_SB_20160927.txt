2. BACKGROUND

The Issuer has been in discussions for some time with an `ad hoc' committee o f Bondholders holding in excess of 97% of the Bonds with respect to a potential restructuring

<<<

 of the Bonds. While those negotiations have been constructive, no terms have yet been finalised. The Issuer would like to request a short-term extension to the Maturity Date o f the Bonds, which is currently 30 September 2016, to 31 October

<<<

 2016 (the "Maturity Date Extension") to afford it time to conclude those negotiations and to allow it to resolve terms for restructuring the Bonds and implement such restructuring. The Issuer also acknowledges that the Bond Trustee (acting

<<<

 on the instructions of the Bondholders, in their sole discretion, pursuant to authority granted at a Bondholders' Meeting or by way o f a Written Resolution) may declare the Bonds to be immediately due and payable at any time during the period

<<<

 of the Maturity Date Extension.

In light o f the above, the Issuer is proposing the following amendments to the Bond Agreement (and in this paragraph, all references to a "Clause" are to the relevant clause in the Bond Agreement):

(a) the

<<<

 words "30 September 2016" in the definition o f "Maturity Date" in Clause 1.1 o f the Bond Agreement shall be deleted and replaced with the words "31 October 2016" (the "Maturity Date Extension"); and

(b) Clause 10.1 shall be deleted in its

<<<

 entirety and the following shall be inserted as a new Clause 10. 1:
