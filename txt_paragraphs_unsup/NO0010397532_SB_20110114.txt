 as trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the following loans issued by Eitzen Maritime Service ASA (the "Company"): (i) NO 001 039753.2Eitzen Martime Services ASA Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010 (the "1st pri Loan") and (ii

) NO 001 059350.2 and NO 001 059351.0- Eitzen Maritime Services ASA Senior Callable Bond Issue 2010/2015 (the "2ndpri Loan", and together with the 1st pri Loan, the "1st and 2 ndLoans").
The Company has convened this meeting upon the request

<<<

 of Bondholders holding more than 2/3 of the principal face amount of the 1st pri Loan and more than 2/3 of the principal face amount of the 2nd pri Loan (together the "Consenting Bondholders"). The Consenting Bondholders have committed to support

<<<

 and vote in favour of the matters referred to herein.
1. Background
The above captioned bond loan agreements were entered based on a security package based on inter alia the following assets:
1. pledge over all shares in Seven Seas Shipchandlers

<<<

 LLC, Seven Seas Marine Services LLC, and Seven Seas Djibouti FZE (the "Share Pledge"), and
2. charge of inventory (varelagerpant), (the "Charge of Inventory") from Seven Seas Shipchandlers LLC Seven Seas Marine Services LLC, and Seven Seas

<<<

 Djibouti FZE,
It has proven that the Share Pledge and Charge of Inventory as mentioned above are not possible and/or legally practical due to the lack of adequate legislation, save for share pledge in Seven Seas FZE (Djibouti) which is in the

<<<

 process of being established, however, with some uncertainty related to it.
Concerning the Charge of Inventory in EMS Ship Supply (Spain) S.A., NTM and its legal advisor has from a cost-benefit assessment deemed it reasonably satisfactory for

<<<

 the Bondholders to pledge only three of the warehouses in Spain based on a threshold value of EUR 500,000 (there being 20 warehouses in Spain in total).
Furthermore, some companies do not own earnings account and some companies do not own any

<<<

 intra-group loans, hence such securities is not applicable at present.
