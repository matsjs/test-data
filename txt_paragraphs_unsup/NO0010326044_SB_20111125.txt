* Third, to repay overdue trade creditors including overdue Hawk leases, estimated to total approximately USD 29.0 million however up to such level required in order

<<<

 for overdue trade creditors to be at an acceptable level not exceeding USD 5.0 million;
 Fourth, to retain USD 12.5 million as a working capital and liquidity buffer of the Issuer; and
 Fifth, any remaining proceeds, estimated to be approximately

<<<

 USD 49.8 million (but in no event less than USD 47 million), shall be used to partially redeem the Bond Loans, the PGS CB and the Perestroika CB on a pro rata basis. This is expected to give a partial redemption of about 32% for each of the

4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
4.1 THE ISSUER'S EVALUATION
The Company, together with its Advisors

<<<

, has over the last four months evaluated several alternatives to strengthen the Company's financial position. The Company has worked intensively with all key stakeholders and the Fugro Transaction was evaluated against other options with the

<<<

 overall goal of maximizing values for all stakeholders and meeting the financial obligations of the Company. The Company is of the opinion that long-term financial stability can best be addressed within the wider scope of the Restructuring

<<<

 Plan. The Issuer acknowledges that significant concessions are required from the Bondholders, however firmly believes that the Restructuring Plan represents a balanced proposal that will substantially reduce financial risk profile of the Company

<<<

, and thereby safeguard values for the Bondholders in the current continued challenging seismic market. Consequently, the Issuer is respectfully asking the Bondholders to approve the Proposal.
The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that Bondholders

<<<

 representing more than 2/3 of the SBX01 Bond and more than 2/3 of the SBX02 Bond have granted their pre-approval to the Proposal and have irrevocably undertaken to vote in favor of the Proposal in the Bondholders' meeting.

4.2 Non-reliance

<<<


The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
