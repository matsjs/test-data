(1)

Consists of our 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG, our 3

<<<

3.33% ownership interest in the Cool Pool and our investment in Gastrade. On October 1, 2015, GasLog, Dynagas

and Golar signed an LNG carrier pooling agreement to establish the Cool Pool to market their vessels which are currently operating

<<<

 in the LNG shipping spot market. The Cool

Pool allows the participating owners to optimize the operation of the pool vessels through improved scheduling ability, cost efficiencies and common marketing. The objective of

the Cool Pool is to

<<<

 serve the transportation requirements of a rapidly growing LNG shipping market by providing customers with reliable, yet flexible, and innovative solutions to

meet their increasingly complex shipping requirements. The Cool Pool was incorporated

<<<

 in September 2015. Gastrade is a private limited company licensed to develop an

independent natural gas system offshore Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece utilizing a floating storage and regasification unit ("FSRU") along with other fixed

<<<

 infrastructure.

(2)

Includes delivered ships (including dry-docking component of vessel cost) as well as office property and other tangible assets, less accumulated depreciation. See Note 6 to our

consolidated financial statements included

<<<

 elsewhere in this annual report.

(3)

Presentation of fleet data does not include newbuildings on order during the relevant periods. The data presented regarding our owned fleet includes only our owned ships delivered

prior to December 3

<<<

1, 2017 including the ships owned by GasLog Partners. The data presented regarding our managed fleet includes our wholly owned vessels as well as ships

owned by GasLog Partners, Egypt LNG and Lepta Shipping that are or were operating under

<<<

 our management.

(4)

The operating days for our owned and bareboat fleet are the total number of days in a given period that the vessels (including the Methane Julia Louise, our vessel on a bareboat

charter) were in our possession less the

<<<

 total number of days off-hire not recoverable from the insurers. In 2017, operating days include 1,768 days for our vessels operating in the

Cool Pool. We define days off-hire as days lost to, among other things, operational deficiencies,

<<<

 dry-docking for repairs, maintenance or inspection, equipment breakdowns, special

surveys and vessel upgrades, delays due to accidents, crew strikes, certain vessel detentions or similar problems, our failure to maintain the vessel in compliance

<<<

 with its

specifications and contractual standards or to provide the required crew, or periods of commercial waiting time during which we do not earn charter hire.

(5)

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

EBITDA is defined as earnings before depreciation

<<<

, amortization, financial income and costs, gain/loss on swaps and taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before foreign exchange gains/losses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that are used as supplemental financial

<<<

 measures by management and external users of financial statements, such as investors, to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist our management and investors by increasing the

<<<

 comparability of our performance from period to period. We believe that including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors in (i) understanding and analyzing the results of our operating and business performance, (ii

<<<

) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives and (iii) monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold our common shares. This is achieved by excluding the potentially

<<<

 disparate effects between periods of financial costs, gain/loss on swaps, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, foreign exchange gains/losses, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing

D. Risk Factors

Risks Inherent to Our Business

As

<<<

 ofFebruary 26, 2018, our owned and bareboatfleet consists o f24 LNG carriers (including the 12 LNG carriers owned by GasLog Partners) andfive newbuilds. The majority o f our ships currently operate under multi-year charters withfive ships operating

<<<

 in the spot market but the charters ofafurther six ships will terminate in 2018 and 2019. Any limitation in the availability/operation o f our ships or an increase in the number o fships operating in the spot market or a reduction in demandfor

<<<

 spot LNG carriers could have a negative impact on the level or volatility of charter rates in the LNG shipping spot market which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cashflows

<<<

 and could significantly reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends.

19 of our owned and bareboat vessels (including the 12 LNG Carriers owned by GasLog Partners) currently operate under multi-year charters. Four of our newbuilds will

<<<

 operate under multi-year charters following delivery from the shipyard, one of our newbuilds is uncommitted and five of our vessels are currently operating in the spot market. However, five Partnership vessels, the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog

<<<

 Santiago, the GasLog Sydney, the Methane Jane Elizabeth and the Methane Alison Victoria are due to come off charter in May 2018, July 2018, September 2018, October 2019 and December 2019, respectively, each plus or minus 30 days. In addition

<<<

, the GasLog Salem is due to come off charter in September 2019, plus or minus 30 days. GasLog Partners and GasLog continue to pursue opportunities for new multi-year charters with third parties for these vessels, but may have difficulty in

<<<

 securing new charters at attractive rates and durations. In the interim, we may have increased exposure to the volatile spot market which is highly competitive and subject to significant price fluctuations.

Failure to secure new multi-year

<<<

 charters could adversely affect our future liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders, as well as our ability to meet certain of our debt covenants. A sustained decline in charter

<<<

 rates could also adversely affect the market value of our vessels, on which certain of the ratios and financial covenants with which we are required to comply are based. Vessel values may fluctuate substantially, which could result in an impairment

<<<

 charge, could impact our compliance with the covenants in our loan agreements and, if the values are lower at a time when we are attempting to dispose of vessels, could cause us to incur a loss.

If any of our vessels is unable to generate

<<<

 revenues for any significant period of time for any reason, including unexpected periods of off-hire, early charter termination (which could result from damage to our vessels) or failure to secure employment for any vessels for which we have

<<<

 not secured charters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, could be materially and adversely affected. The impact of any limitation in the operation

<<<

 of our vessels or any early charter termination would be amplified during

6

Table of Contents
the period prior to delivery of our newbuildings, as a substantial portion of our cash flows and income are dependent on the revenues earned by

<<<

 the chartering of our 24 owned and bareboat LNG carriers in operation. In addition, the costs of vessel repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. In the event ofrepair costs that are not covered by our insurance policies, we may have

<<<

 to pay for such repair costs, which would decrease our earnings and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. If the Partnership is unable to re-deploy a vessel, it will not receive any revenues from that vessel

<<<

, and it would be required to pay expenses necessary to maintain the vessel in proper operating condition as well as service the debt attached to that vessel.
Ourfuture growth depends on our ability to expand relationships with existing customers

<<<

, establish new customer relationships and obtain new time charter contractsfor existing vessels andfor additional newbuild LNG carriers and/or FSRUs, for which we willface substantial competitionfrom established companies with significant resources

<<<

, as well as potential new entrants.
One of our principal objectives is to enter into multi-year, fixed-rate charters for our open on-the-water vessels and for potential additional newbuild vessels. We are seeking to enter into time charter

<<<

 contracts for the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Savannah and the GasLog Saratoga which currently operate in the spot market through the Cool Pool and the GasLog Skagen, which will operate in the Cool Pool from September 

<<<

2018. We will also seek to enter into new time charter contracts upon the expiration or early termination of our existing charter arrangements, including in respect of the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago, the GasLog Sydney, the Methane

<<<

 Jane Elizabeth and the Methane Alison Victoria, all of which are owned by GasLog Partners, and the GasLog Salem. In addition, we are seeking to enter into time charter contracts for the newbuild LNG carriers and for newbuild or converted FSRUs

<<<

, including for Hull No. 2212. The process of obtaining long-term, fixed rate charters for LNG carriers is highly competitive and generally involves an intensive screening process by potential new customers and the submission of competitive

<<<

 bids, all of which can often extend for several months. We believe LNG carrier time charters are awarded based upon a variety of factors relating to the ship and the ship operator, including:

·

size, age, technical specifications and condition

<<<

 of the ship;

·

efficiency of ship operation;

·

LNG shipping experience and quality of ship operations;

·

shipping industry relationships and reputation for customer service;

· technical ability and reputation for operation of highly

<<<

 specialized ships;

·

quality and experience of officers and crew;

·

safety record;

· the ability to finance ships at competitive rates and financial stability generally;

· relationships with shipyards and the ability to get suitable berths

<<<

;

·

construction management experience, including the ability to obtain on-time delivery of new ships according to customer specifications; and

·

competitiveness of the bid in terms of overall price.

7

Table of Contents
We expect substantial

<<<

 competition from a number of experienced companies. Competitors may include other independent ship owners, state-sponsored entities and major energy companies that own and operate LNG carriers, all of whom may compete with independent owners

<<<

 by using their own fleets to carry LNG for third parties. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources and larger fleets than we have, and some have particular relationships that may provide them with competitive

<<<

 advantages. A number of marine transportation companies--including companies with strong reputations and extensive resources and experience--have entered the LNG transportation market in recent years and there are other ship owners and managers

<<<

 who may also attempt to participate in the LNG market in the future. This increased competition may cause greater price competition for time charters. As a result, we may be unable to expand our relationships with existing customers or to obtain

<<<

 new customers on a profitable basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. We may not be successful

<<<

 in executing any future growth plans, and we may incur significant expenses and losses in connection with such growth efforts.
If the short-term or spot LNG carrier charter market continues to expand and results in reduced opportunities to

<<<

 secure multi-year chartersfor our vessels, our revenues and cashflows may become more volatile and may declinefollowing expiration or early termination of our current charter arrangements.
Most shipping requirements for new LNG projects continue

<<<

 to be provided on a multi-year basis, though the level of spot voyages and short-term time charters of less than 12 months in duration has grown in the past few years. If the short-term or spot charter market continues to expand, we may enter

<<<

 into short-term time charters upon expiration or early termination of our current charters. As a result, our revenues and cash flows may become more volatile. In addition, an active short-term or spot charter market may require us to enter

<<<

 into charters based on changing market prices, as opposed to contracts based on fixed rates, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, especially if we enter

<<<

 into charters during periods when charter rates are depressed.
Further technological advancements and other innovations affecting LNG carriers could reduce the charter hire rates we are able to obtain when seeking new employmentfor existing

<<<

 or newbuild vessels and this could adversely impact the value o f our assets and our results of operations and cashflows.
The charter rates, asset value and operational life of an LNG carrier are determined by a number of factors, including

<<<

 the ship's efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency is reflected in unit freight costs ("UFC") which are driven by the size of the vessel, its fuel economy and the rate at which LNG in the cargo tanks naturally evaporates

<<<

 ("boil-off ratio" or "BOR"). Flexibility is primarily driven by the size of the ship and includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. Physical life is related to the original

<<<

 design and construction, the ongoing maintenance and the impact of operational stresses on the asset. Ship, cargo containment and engine designs are continually evolving. At such time, as newer designs are developed and accepted in the market

<<<

, these newer vessels may be more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than our ships. Competition from these more technologically advanced LNG carriers compared to our vessels with older technology could adversely affect

<<<

 our ability to charter or re-charter our ships and the charter hire rates we will be able to secure when we seek to charter or re-charter our ships, and could also reduce the resale value of our ships. This could adversely affect our revenues

<<<

 and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

Ourfuture performance and ability to securefuture time charters depends on continued growth in LNGproduction and demandfor LNG and LNG shipping

<<<

.
Our future performance, including our ability to profitably expand our fleet, will depend on continued growth in LNG production and the demand for LNG and LNG shipping. A complete LNG project includes natural gas production, liquefaction,

<<<

 storage, regasification and distribution facilities, in addition to the marine transportation of LNG. Increased infrastructure investment has led to an expansion of LNG production capacity in recent years, but material delays in the construction

<<<

 or slower than expected ramp-up of new liquefaction facilities could constrain the amount of LNG available for shipping, reducing ship utilization. The rate of growth of the LNG industry has fluctuated due to several factors, including the

<<<

 rate of global economic growth, fluctuations in global commodity prices, including natural gas, oil and coal as well as other sources of energy, and energy and environmental policy in markets which produce and/or consume LNG. Continued growth

<<<

 in LNG production and demand for LNG and LNG shipping could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including:

· prices for crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas;

· the cost of natural gas derived from LNG relative to the cost

<<<

 of natural gas generally and to the cost of alternative fuels, including renewables, and the impact of increases in the cost of natural gas derived from LNG on consumption of LNG;

·

increases in the production levels of lower cost natural

<<<

 gas in domestic natural gas consuming markets, which could further depress prices for

natural gas in those markets and make LNG uneconomical;

·

increases in the production ofnatural gas in areas linked by pipelines to consuming areas, or

<<<

 the extension of existing pipelines, or the

development of new pipeline systems in markets we may serve;

·

infrastructure constraints such as delays in the construction of liquefaction facilities or regasification facilities, the inability

<<<

 of project owners

or operators to obtain governmental approvals to construct or operate LNG facilities, as well as community or political action group resistance

to new LNG infrastructure due to concerns about the environment, safety and

<<<

 terrorism;

·

increases in interest rates or other events that may affect the availability of sufficient financing for LNG projects on commercially reasonable

terms;

· negative global or regional economic or political conditions, particularly

<<<

 in LNG consuming regions which could reduce energy consumption or its growth;

· new taxes or regulations affecting LNG production or liquefaction that make LNG production less attractive;

·

labor or political unrest or military conflicts

<<<

 affecting existing or proposed areas of LNG production, regasification or consumption;

·

any significant explosion, spill or other incident involving an LNG facility or carrier; or

· regional, national or international energy policies that

<<<

 constrain the production or consumption of hydrocarbons including natural gas.
In recent years, global crude oil prices were very volatile. Any decline in oil prices can depress natural gas prices and lead to a narrowing of the difference in

<<<

 pricing between geographic regions, which can adversely affect the length of voyages in the spot LNG shipping market and the spot rates and medium-term charter rates for charters which commence in the near future.

Table of Contents

A continuation

<<<

 of the recent volatility in natural gas and oil prices may adversely affect our growth prospects, results o f operations and cashflows. Natural gas prices are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including but not

<<<

 limited to the following:

· price and availability of crude oil and petroleum products;

·

worldwide and regional demand for and price of natural gas;

· the cost of exploration, development, production, transportation and distribution of

<<<

 natural gas;

·

expectations regarding future energy prices for both natural gas and other sources of energy, including renewable energy sources;

· the level of worldwide LNG production and exports;

·

government laws and regulations, including

<<<

 but not limited to environmental protection laws and regulations;

·

local and international political, economic and weather conditions;

· political and military conflicts; and

· the availability and cost of alternative energy sources, including

<<<

 coal and alternate sources of natural gas in gas importing and consuming countries.
Given the significant global natural gas and crude oil price volatility referenced above, and with five Partnership vessels and one GasLog vessel currently

<<<

 scheduled to come off charter during 2018 and 2019, a continuation of volatility in natural gas or oil prices may adversely affect our future business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions

<<<

, as a result of, among other things:

·

a reduction in exploration for or development of new natural gas reserves or projects, or the delay or cancellation of existing projects as energy

companies lower their capital expenditures budgets

<<<

, which may reduce our growth opportunities;

·

low oil prices negatively affecting the market price of natural gas, to the extent that natural gas prices are benchmarked to the price of crude

oil, in turn negatively affecting the economics

<<<

 of potential new LNG production projects, which may reduce our growth opportunities;

· high oil prices negatively affecting the competitiveness of natural gas to the extent that natural gas prices are linked to the price of crude oil;

·


<<<


lower demand for vessels ofthe types we own and operate, which may reduce available charter rates and revenue to us upon redeployment of

our vessels following expiration or termination of existing contracts or upon the initial chartering of

<<<

 vessels;

·

customers potentially seeking to renegotiate or terminate existing vessel contracts, or failing to extend or renew contracts upon expiration;

· the inability or refusal of customers to make charter payments to us due to financial

<<<

 constraints or otherwise; or

·

declines in vessel values, which may result in losses to us upon vessel sales or impairment charges against our earnings and could impact

compliance with covenants in loan documentation.

An oversupply ofLNG carriers may lead to a reduction in the charter hire rates we are able to obtain when seeking charters in thefuture which could adversely affect our results of operations and cashflows.
Driven in part by an increase in

<<<

 LNG production capacity, the market supply of LNG carriers has been increasing as a result of the construction of new ships. The development of liquefaction projects in the United States and the anticipation of exports beginning in early 2

<<<

016 drove significant ordering activity. Whilst we saw a decline in ordering of newbuilds during 2017, as of December 31,2017, the LNG carrier order book totaled 95 vessels and the delivered fleet stood at 428 vessels. This and any future expansion

<<<

 ofthe global LNG carrier fleet in excess of the demand for LNG shipping may have a negative impact on charter hire rates, ship utilization and ship values.
If charter hire rates are lower when we are seeking new time charters, our revenues

<<<

 and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, may decline.

Risks associated with operating and managing ocean-going ships could affect our business and reputation. The operation and management of ocean-going ships

<<<

 carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility of:

·

marine disaster;

· piracy;

·

cyber-attack;

·

environmental accidents;

·

adverse weather conditions;

·

grounding, fire, explosions and collisions;

·

cargo and property

<<<

 loss or damage;

· business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, disease and quarantine, or political action in various countries;

·

work stoppages or other labor problems with crew members serving on our

<<<

 ships.

An accident involving any of our owned or managed ships could result in any ofthe following:

·

death or inj ury to persons, loss of property or environmental damage;

·

delays in the delivery of cargo;

·

loss of revenues from termination

<<<

 of charter contracts;

·

governmental fines, penalties or restrictions on conducting business;

·

litigation with our employees, customers or third parties;

· higher insurance rates; and

·

damage to our reputation and customer relationships

<<<

 generally.

Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

Our insurance may be insufficient

<<<

 to cover losses that may occur to ourproperty or resultfrom our operations which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

The operation of any ship includes risks such as mechanical failure, personal inj ury, collision

<<<

, fire, contact with floating objects, property loss or damage, cargo loss or damage and business interruption

11

Table of Contents
due to a number of reasons, including political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities and labor

<<<

 strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of a marine disaster, including collision, explosion, spills and other environmental mishaps, and other liabilities arising from owning, operating or managing ships in international

<<<

 trade. Although we carry protection and indemnity, hull and machinery and loss of hire insurance covering our ships consistent with industry standards, we can give no assurance that we are adequately insured against all risks or that our insurers

<<<

 will pay a particular claim. We also may be unable to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future. Even if our insurance coverage is adequate to cover our losses, we may not be able to obtain a timely

<<<

 replacement ship in the event of a loss of a ship. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders.
In addition, some

<<<

 of our insurance coverage is maintained through mutual protection and indemnity associations, and as a member of such associations we may be required to make additional payments over and above budgeted premiums if member claims exceed association

<<<

 reserves.
The required dry-docking of our ships could be more expensive and time consuming than we anticipate. In 2018, three GasLog Partners vessels and one GasLog vessel are scheduled to be dry-docked. During the scheduled dry-docking, three

<<<

 of thefour vessels will undertake additional work which is expected to enhance their operational performance. The dry-docking timefor these three vessels will be longer than the usual time requiredfor a normal dry-docking. Any overrun of the

<<<

 dry-docking or delay or cost overrun caused by the additional work to the vessels could have a material adverse effect on our business, results o f operations andfinancial condition and could significantly reduce or eliminate our ability to

<<<

 pay dividends to our shareholders.
Dry-dockings of our owned and bareboat ships require significant expenditures and result in loss of revenue while our ships are off-hire during such period. Any significant increase in either the number of

<<<

 off-hire days due to such dry-dockings or in the costs of any repairs carried out during the dry docking period could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and our cash flows. Given the potential for unforeseen issues arising

<<<

 during dry docking, we may not be able to predict accurately the time required to dry-dock any of our vessels. If more than one of our ships is required to be out of service at the same time, or if a ship is dry-docked longer than expected

<<<

 or if the cost of repairs or modifications during the dry-docking is greater than budgeted, our results of operations and our cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, could be adversely affected. The drydockings

<<<

 of all of our vessels (other than the GasLog Shanghai) are expected to be carried out between 2018 and 2023.
We may experience operational problems with vessels that reduce revenue and increase costs. Any limitation in the availability or operation

<<<

 of our ships could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
LNG carriers are complex and their operations are technically challenging. Marine transportation operations are subject

<<<

 to mechanical risks and problems. Operational problems may lead to loss of revenues or higher than anticipated operating expenses or require additional capital expenditures. If any of our ships are unable to generate revenues for any significant

<<<

 period of time for any reason, including unexpected periods of off-hire or early charter termination (which could result from damage to our ships), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available

<<<

 for dividends to shareholders, could be materially and adversely affected. The impact of any limitation in the operation of our ships or any early charter termination would be amplified during the period prior to acquisition of additional vessels

<<<

, as a substantial portion of our cash flows and income is dependent on the revenues earned by the chartering of our LNG carriers in operation. In addition, the costs of ship repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. In the event of

<<<

 repair costs that are not
12

Table of Contents
covered by our insurance policies, we may have to pay for such repair costs, which would decrease our earnings and cash flows. Any of these results could harm our business, financial condition

<<<

, results of operations and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.
Changes in global and regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.
Weak global or regional

<<<

 economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders in ways that we cannot predict. Our ability to expand our fleet beyond

<<<

 our contracted newbuildings will be dependent on our ability to obtain financing to fund the acquisition of additional ships. In addition, uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause our customers to defer projects

<<<

 in response to tighter credit, decreased capital availability and declining customer confidence, may negatively impact the demand for our ships and services and could also result in defaults under our current charters. Global financial markets

<<<

 and economic conditions have been volatile in recent years and remain subject to significant vulnerabilities. A tightening of the credit markets may further negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our suppliers or customers

<<<

, which could lead to disruptions in delivery of supplies such as equipment for conversions, cost increases for supplies, accelerated payments to suppliers, customer bad debts or reduced revenues. Similarly, such market conditions could affect

<<<

 lenders participating in our financing agreements, making them unable to fulfill their commitments and obligations to us. Any reductions in activity owing to such conditions or failure by our customers, suppliers or lenders to meet their contractual

<<<

 obligations to us could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
GasLog LNG Services, our vessels' management company, and a substantial

<<<

 number of its staff are located in Greece. A return of economic instability in Greece could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. We have sought to minimize this risk and preserve operational stability by carefully

<<<

 developing staff deployment plans, an information technology recovery site, an alternative ship to shore communications plan and funding mechanisms outside of Greece. While we believe these plans, combined with the international nature of our

<<<

 operations, will mitigate the impact of any disruption of operations in Greece, we cannot assure you that these plans will be effective in all circumstances.
Compliance with safety and other requirements imposed by classification societies

<<<

 may be very costly and may adversely affect our business.
The hull and machinery of every commercial LNG carrier must be classed by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the ship has been built and subsequently

<<<

 maintained in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of that classification society. Moreover, every ship must comply with all applicable international conventions and the regulations of the ship's flag state as verified by a

<<<

 classification society. Finally, each ship must successfully undergo periodic surveys, including annual, intermediate and special surveys performed under the classification society's rules.
If any ship does not maintain its class, it will lose

<<<

 its insurance coverage and be unable to trade, and the ship's owner will be in breach of relevant covenants under its financing arrangements. Failure to maintain the class of one or more of our ships could have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

If we cannot meet our charterers' quality and compliance requirements we may not be

<<<

 able to operate our vessels profitably which could have an adverse effect on ourfuture performance, results o f operations, cashflows andfinancialposition.
Customers, and in particular those in the LNG industry, have a high and increasing focus

<<<

 on quality and compliance standards with their suppliers across the entire value chain, including the shipping and transportation segment. Our continuous compliance with these standards and quality requirements is vital for our operations.

<<<

 Related risks could materialize in multiple ways, including a sudden and unexpected breach in quality and/or compliance concerning one or more vessels and/or a continuous decrease in the quality concerning one or more LNG carriers occurring

<<<

 over time. Moreover, continuously increasing requirements from LNG industry constituents can further challenge our ability to meet the standards. Any noncompliance by us, either suddenly or over a period of time, on one or more LNG carriers

<<<

, or an increase in requirements by our charterers above and beyond what we deliver, may have a material adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
The LNG shipping industry is subject

<<<

 to substantial environmental and other regulations, which may significantly limit our operations or increase our expenses.
Our operations are materially affected by extensive and changing international, national, state and local environmental

<<<

 laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards which are in force in international waters, or in the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which our ships operate and in the countries in which our ships are registered. These requirements

<<<

 include those relating to equipping and operating ships, providing security and minimizing or addressing impacts on the environment from ship operations. We may incur substantial costs in complying with these requirements, including costs for

<<<

 ship modifications and changes in operating procedures. We also could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, the suspension or termination of operations and third-party claims as a result

<<<

 of violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations.
In addition, these requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of our ships, require a reduction in cargo capacity, necessitate ship modifications or operational

<<<

 changes or restrictions or lead to decreased availability of insurance coverage for environmental matters. They could further result in the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports or detention in certain ports. We are required

<<<

 to obtain governmental approvals and permits to operate our ships. Delays in obtaining such governmental approvals may increase our expenses, and the terms and conditions of such approvals could materially and adversely affect our operations

<<<

.
Additional laws and regulations may be adopted that could limit our ability to do business or increase our operating costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business. For example, new or amended legislation relating to ship

<<<

 recycling, sewage systems, emission control (including emissions of greenhouse gases) as well as ballast water treatment and ballast water handling may be adopted. The United States has recently enacted ballast water management system legislation

<<<

 and regulations that require more stringent controls of air and water emissions from ocean-going ships. Such legislation or regulations may require additional capital expenditures or operating expenses (such as increased costs for low-sulfur

<<<

 fuel) in order for us to maintain our ships' compliance with international and/or national regulations. We also may become subject to additional laws and regulations if we enter new markets or trades.
We also believe that the heightened environmental

<<<

, quality and security concerns of insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers will generally lead to additional regulatory requirements, including enhanced risk assessment and security requirements, as well as greater inspection of and

<<<

 safety requirements on all LNG carriers. These requirements are likely to add incremental costs to our
14

Table of Contents
operations, and the failure to comply with these requirements may affect the ability of our ships to obtain and, possibly

<<<

, recover from, insurance or to obtain the required certificates for entry into some of the ports where we operate.
Some environmental laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or "OPA", provide for potentially unlimited

<<<

 joint, several and/or strict liability for owners, operators and demise or bareboat charterers for oil pollution and related damages. OPA applies to discharges of any oil from a ship in U.S. waters, including discharges of fuel and lubricants

<<<

 from an LNG carrier, even if the ships do not carry oil as cargo. In addition, many states in the United States bordering a navigable waterway have enacted legislation providing for potentially unlimited strict liability without regard to fault

<<<

 for the discharge of pollutants within their waters. We also are subject to other laws and conventions outside the United States that provide for an owner or operator of LNG carriers to bear strict liability for pollution, such as the Convention

<<<

 on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, or the "London Convention".
Some of these laws and conventions, including OPA and the London Convention, may include limitations on liability. However, the limitations may not be applicable

<<<

 in certain circumstances, such as where a spill is caused by a ship owner's or operator's intentional or reckless conduct. These limitations are also subject to periodic updates and may otherwise be amended in the future.
Compliance with OPA

<<<

 and other environmental laws and regulations also may result in ship owners and operators incurring increased costs for additional maintenance and inspection requirements, the development of contingency arrangements for potential spills, obtaining

<<<

 mandated insurance coverage and meeting financial responsibility requirements.
Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may adversely impact our operations and markets.
Due to concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries

<<<

 and the International Maritime Organization, or "IMO", have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emission from ships. These regulatory measures may include the adoption of cap and trade

<<<

 regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Although emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping currently are not subject to agreements under the United Nations Framework

<<<

 Convention on Climate Change, such as the "Kyoto Protocol" and the "Paris Agreement", a new treaty may be adopted in the future that includes additional restrictions on shipping emissions to those already adopted under the International Convention

<<<

 for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships, or the "MARPOL Convention". Compliance with future changes in laws and regulations relating to climate change could increase the costs of operating and maintaining our ships and could require

<<<

 us to install new emission controls, as well as acquire allowances, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities may also

<<<

 be adversely affected.
Adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry relating to climate change, including growing public concern about the environmental impact of climate change, may also have an effect on demand for our services. For example

<<<

, increased regulation of greenhouse gases or other concerns relating to climate change may reduce the demand for oil and natural gas in the future or create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources. Any long-term material adverse

<<<

 effect on the oil and gas industry could have significant and unpredictable financial and operational adverse impacts on our business.
We operate our ships worldwide, which could expose us to political, governmental and economic instability

<<<

 that could harm our business.
Because we operate our ships in the geographic areas where our customers do business, our operations may be affected by political, governmental and economic conditions in the countries where
15

Table of Contents

<<<


our ships operate or where they are registered. Any disruption caused by these factors could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders. In particular

<<<

, our ships frequent LNG terminals in countries including Egypt, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and Trinidad, as well as transit through the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Malacca. Economic, political and governmental conditions in these and other

<<<

 regions have from time to time resulted in military conflicts, terrorism, attacks on ships, mining of waterways, piracy and other efforts to disrupt shipping. Future hostilities or other political instability in the geographic regions where

<<<

 we operate or may operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders. In addition, our business could also be harmed

<<<

 by tariffs, trade embargoes and other economic sanctions by the United States or other countries against countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia or elsewhere as a result of terrorist attacks, hostilities or diplomatic or political pressures

<<<

 that limit trading activities with those countries.
Terrorist attacks, international hostilities, political change and piracy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Terrorist attacks

<<<

, piracy and the current conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as other current and future conflicts and political change, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including

<<<

 cash available for dividends to our shareholders. The continuing hostilities in the Middle East may lead to additional acts ofterrorism, further regional conflicts, other armed actions around the world and civil disturbance in the United States

<<<

 or elsewhere, which may contribute to further instability in the global financial markets. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
In the past, political

<<<

 conflicts have also resulted in attacks on ships, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulfregion. Acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected ships trading in regions such

<<<

 as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Any terrorist attacks targeted at ships may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends

<<<

 to our shareholders and could directly impact our ships or our customers.
We currently employ armed guards onboard certain vessels operating in areas that may be prone to hijacking or terrorist attacks. The presence of armed guards may increase

<<<

 the risk of damage, injury or loss of life in connection with any attacks on our vessels, in addition to increasing crew costs.
We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from acts of terrorism, piracy, regional conflicts and other armed

<<<

 actions, including losses relating to the employment of armed guards.
LNG facilities, shipyards, ships, pipelines and gas fields could be targets of future terrorist attacks or piracy. Any such attacks could lead to, among other things, bodily

<<<

 injury or loss of life, as well as damage to the ships or other property, increased ship operating costs, including insurance costs, reductions in the supply of LNG and the inability to transport LNG to or from certain locations. Terrorist

<<<

 attacks, war or other events beyond our control that adversely affect the production, storage or transportation of LNG to be shipped by us could entitle our customers to terminate our charter contracts in certain circumstances, which would

<<<

 harm our cash flows and our business.
Terrorist attacks, or the perception that LNG facilities and LNG carriers are potential terrorist targets, could materially and adversely affect expansion of LNG infrastructure and the continued supply

<<<

 of LNG. Concern that LNG facilities may be targeted for attack by terrorists has contributed significantly to local community and environmental group resistance to the construction of a number of LNG facilities, primarily in North America.

<<<

 If a terrorist incident involving an LNG facility or LNG carrier did occur, in addition to the possible effects identified in the previous paragraph, the incident
16

Table of Contents
may adversely affect the construction of additional LNG

<<<

 facilities and could lead to the temporary or permanent closing of various LNG facilities currently in operation.
A cyber-attack could materially disrupt GasLog's business.
GasLog's business operations could be targeted by individuals or groups

<<<

 seeking to sabotage or disrupt GasLog's information technology systems and networks, or to steal data. A successful cyber-attack could materially disrupt GasLog's operations, including the safety of its operations, or lead to unauthorized release

<<<

 of information or alteration of information on its systems. Any such attack or other breach of GasLog's information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on GasLog's business, financial condition, results of operations and

<<<

 cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
In thefuture, the ships we own or manage could be required to call at ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the United States and other

<<<

 governments.
The United States and other governments and their agencies impose sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and maintain lists of countries they consider to be state sponsors ofterrorism. For example, in 2010, the United States

<<<

 enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act, or "CISADA", which expanded the scope of the former Iran Sanctions Act. Among other things, CISADA expanded the application of the prohibitions imposed by the U.S.

<<<

 government to non-U.S. companies, such as GasLog, and limits the ability of companies and persons to do business or trade with Iran when such activities relate to the investment, supply or export of refined petroleum or petroleum products,

<<<

 as well as LNG.
In 2012, President Obama signed Executive Order 13608, which prohibits foreign persons from violating, or attempting to violate, or causing a violation of, any sanctions in effect against Iran, or facilitating any deceptive

<<<

 transactions for or on behalf of any person subject to U.S. sanctions. The Secretary of the Treasury may prohibit any transactions or dealings, including any U.S. capital markets financing, involving any person found to be in violation of Executive

<<<

 Order 13608. Also in 2012, the U.S. enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or the "ITRA", which created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions. Among other things, the ITRA intensifies existing sanctions

<<<

 regarding the provision of goods, services, infrastructure or technology to Iran's petroleum or petrochemical sector. The ITRA also includes a provision requiring the President ofthe United States to impose five or more sanctions from Section

<<<

 6(a) of the Iran Sanctions Act, as amended, on a person the President determines is a controlling beneficial owner of, or otherwise owns, operates, or controls or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from Iran to another country

<<<

 and (1) if the person is a controlling beneficial owner of the vessel, the person had actual knowledge the vessel was so used or (2) if the person otherwise owns, operates, or controls, or insures the vessel, the person knew or should have

<<<

 known the vessel was so used. Such a person could be subject to a variety o f sanctions, including exclusion from U.S. capital markets, exclusion from financial transactions subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and exclusion of such person's vessels

<<<

 from U.S. ports for up to two years. The ITRA also includes a requirement that issuers of securities must disclose to the SEC in their annual and quarterly reports filed after February 6, 2013 whether the issuer or "any affiliate" has "knowingly

<<<

" engaged in certain sanctioned activities involving Iran during the timeframe covered by the report. Finally, in January 2013, the U.S. enacted the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 or the "IFCA", which expanded the scope of

<<<

 U.S. sanctions on any person that is part of Iran's energy, shipping or shipbuilding sector and operators of ports in Iran, and imposes penalties on any person who facilitates or otherwise knowingly provides significant financial, material

<<<

 or other support to these entities.
On January 16, 2016, the United States suspended certain sanctions against Iran applicable to non-U.S. companies, such as us, pursuant to the nuclear agreement reached between Iran, China,
17

Table of Contents

<<<


France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. To implement these changes, beginning on January 16, 2016, the United States waived enforcement of many of the sanctions against Iran's energy and petrochemical

<<<

 sectors described above, including, among other things, certain provisions of CISADA, ITRA, and IFCA. While non-U.S. companies may now engage in certain business or trade with Iran that was previously prohibited, the U.S. has the ability to

<<<

 reimpose sanctions against Iran.
Although the ships we own have not called on ports in countries subject to sanctions or embargoes or in countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, North Korea and Syria, we cannot assure

<<<

 you that these ships will not call on ports in these countries in the future. While we intend to maintain compliance with all sanctions and embargoes applicable to us, U.S. and international sanctions and embargo laws and regulations do not

<<<

 necessarily apply to the same countries or proscribe the same activities, which may make compliance difficult. Additionally, the scope of certain laws may be unclear, and these laws may be subj ect to changing interpretations and application

<<<

 and may be amended or strengthened from time to time, including by adding or removing countries from the proscribed lists. Violations of sanctions and embargo laws and regulations could result in fines or other penalties and could result in

<<<

 some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their investment, or not to invest, in us.
Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UKBribery Act and other anti-bribery legislation in otherjurisdictions could

<<<

 result in fines, criminalpenalties, contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business.
We operate our ships worldwide, requiring our ships to trade in countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing

<<<

 business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics which is consistently applied and in full compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the "FCPA", and

<<<

 the Bribery Act 2010 of the United Kingdom or the "UK Bribery Act". We are subject, however, to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take actions determined to be

<<<

 in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, or curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and

<<<

 might adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to

<<<

 do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant senior management time and attention.
Changing laws and evolving reporting requirements could have an adverse

<<<

 effect on our business.
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to reporting requirements, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), may create additional compliance requirements for us. To maintain

<<<

 high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, GasLog has invested in, and intends to continue to invest in, reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards.
GDPR broadens the scope of personal privacy laws to

<<<

 protect the rights of European Union citizens and requires organizations to report on data breaches within 72 hours and be bound by more stringent rules for obtaining the consent of individuals on how their data can be used. GDPR will become

<<<

 enforceable on May 25, 2018 and non-compliance may expose entities to significant fines or other regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay

<<<

 dividends.

Reliability ofsuppliers may limit our ability to obtain supplies and services when needed.
We rely, and will in the future rely, on a significant supply of consumables, spare parts and equipment to operate

<<<

, maintain, repair and upgrade our fleet of ships. Delays in delivery or unavailability of supplies could result in off-hire days due to consequent delays in the repair and maintenance of our fleet. This would negatively impact our revenues

<<<

 and cash flows. Cost increases could also negatively impact our future operations, although the impact o f significant cost increases may be mitigated to some extent with respect to the vessels that are employed under charter contracts with

<<<

 automatic periodic adjustment provisions or cost review provisions.
Governments could requisition our ships during a period o f war or emergency, resulting in loss o f earnings.
The government of a jurisdiction where one or more of our ships

<<<

 are registered could requisition for title or seize our ships. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a ship and becomes its owner. Also, a government could requisition our ships for hire. Requisition for hire occurs

<<<

 when a government takes control of a ship and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition ships in other circumstances

<<<

. Although we would expect to be entitled to government compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our ships, the amount and timing of payments, if any, would be uncertain. A government requisition of one or more of our ships

<<<

 would result in off-hire days under our time charters and may cause us to breach covenants in certain of our credit facilities, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows

<<<

, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Maritime claimants could arrest our ships, which could interrupt our cashflows.
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a ship, shippers or receivers of cargo and other parties

<<<

 may be entitled to a maritime lien against a ship for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by arresting a ship. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our ships which is

<<<

 not timely discharged could cause us to default on a charter or breach covenants in certain of our credit facilities and, to the extent such arrest or attachment is not covered by our protection and indemnity insurance, could require us to

<<<

 pay large sums of money to have the arrest or attachment lifted. Any ofthese occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends

<<<

 to our shareholders.
Additionally, in some jurisdictions, such as the Republic of South Africa, under the "sister ship" theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the ship that is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any "associated

<<<

" ship, which is any ship owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert "sister ship" liability against one ship in our fleet for claims relating to another of our ships.
We may be subject to litigation that could have

<<<

 an adverse effect on us.
We may in the future be involved from time to time in litigation matters. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, toxic tort claims

<<<

, employment matters and governmental claims for taxes or duties, as well as other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any claim or other litigation matter. The ultimate

<<<

 outcome of any litigation matter and the potential costs associated with prosecuting or defending such lawsuits, including the diversion of management's attention to these matters, could have an adverse effect on us and, in the event of litigation

<<<

 that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us, could lead to an event of default under certain of our credit facilities.

Risks Inherent in an Investment in GasLog
We depend upon one customerfor

<<<

 nearly all o f our revenues. The loss o f this customer would result in a significant loss o f revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cashflows.

We have historically

<<<

 derived nearly all of our revenues from subsidiaries of Shell. For the year ended December 31,2017, Shell accounted for 92.6% of our revenues. Following the delivery of our five new LNG carriers on order, Shell will continue to be a key customer

<<<

, as two of our newbuildings will be chartered to MSL upon delivery, resulting in a total of 18 owned vessels being chartered to Shell. We could lose Shell as a customer or the benefits of our time charter or ship management arrangements for

<<<

 many different reasons, including if Shell is unable or unwilling to make charter hire or other payments to us because of a deterioration in its financial condition, disagreements with us or otherwise. If Shell or another customer terminates

<<<

 its charters, chooses not to re-charter our ships after the initial charter terms or is unable to perform under its charters and we are not able to find replacement charters on similar terms, we will suffer a loss ofrevenues that could have

<<<

 a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

Any charter termination could have a material adverse effect on our business

<<<

, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.

Our charterers have the right to terminate a ship's time charter in certain circumstances, such as:

·

loss of the ship or damage to it beyond repair;

·

if the ship is off-hire

<<<

 for any reason other than scheduled dry-docking for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days, or for more than 90 days or

110 days, depending on the charter, in any one-year period;

·

defaults by us in our obligations under the charter; or

<<<



· the outbreak of war or hostilities involving two or more major nations, such as the United States or the People's Republic of China, that would materially and adversely affect the trading of the ship for a period of at least 30 days.

A

<<<

 termination right under one ship's time charter would not automatically give the charterer the right to terminate its other charter contracts with us. However, a charter termination could materially affect our relationship with the customer

<<<

 and our reputation in the LNG shipping industry, and in some circumstances the event giving rise to the termination right could potentially impact multiple charters. Accordingly, the existence of any right of termination could have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

Due to our lack o f diversification, adverse developments in the LNG transportation industry

<<<

 could adversely affect our business, particularly ifsuch developments occur at a time when we are seeking a new charter.

We rely exclusively on the cash flow generated from charters for our LNG vessels and management of third party LNG vessels

<<<

. Due to our lack of diversification, an adverse development in the LNG or the LNG transportation industry could have a significantly greater impact on our business, particularly if such developments occur at a time when our ships are not under

<<<

 charter or nearing the end of their charters, than if we maintained more diverse assets or lines ofbusinesses.

Our contractsfor thefive newbuildings we have on order as o fFebruary 26, 2018, are subject to risks that

<<<

 could cause delays in the delivery o f the ships, which could adversely affect our results o foperations and cashflows.
Our five contracted newbuildings are scheduled to be delivered to us on various dates between 2018 and 2020. Significant

<<<

 delays in the delivery of one or more of these ships, which are expected to generate a substantial portion of our contracted revenue in future years, would delay our receipt ofrevenues under the related time charters. For prolonged delays,

<<<

 the customer may terminate the charter and, in addition to the resulting loss of revenues, we may be responsible for additional substantial liquidated damages, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations

<<<

 and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, the delivery of any of these ships with substantial defects or unexpected operational problems could have similar consequences.
The completion and delivery

<<<

 of newbuildings or conversions could be delayed because of:

·

quality or engineering problems;

·

changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organization standards;

·

work stoppages or other labor disturbances at the

<<<

 shipyard;

· bankruptcy or other financial crisis of the shipbuilder;

·

a backlog of orders at the shipyard;

· political or economic disturbances;

·

weather interference or a catastrophic event, such as a major earthquake or fire;

· requests

<<<

 for changes to the original vessel specifications;

·

shortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials, such as steel;

· the inability to finance the construction or conversion of the vessels; or

· the inability

<<<

 to obtain requisite permits or approvals.
If delivery of a vessel is materially delayed, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders

.
As we take delivery of our newbuildings or any secondhand ships we acquire in thefuture, we will need to expand our staffand crew. I f we cannot recruit and retain employees and provide adequate compensation, our business,financial condition

<<<

, results of operations and cashflows may be adversely affected.
Our ability to acquire and retain customers depends on a number of factors, including our ability to staff our vessels with masters, officers and crews of suitable experience in

<<<

 operating LNG carriers. As we take delivery of our newbuildings or any secondhand ships we acquire in the future, we expect to hire a significant number of seafarers qualified to staff and operate our new vessels, as well as additional shoreside

<<<

 personnel. As the global LNG carrier fleet continues to grow, we expect the demand for technically skilled and experienced officers and crew to increase. This could lead to an industry-wide shortfall of qualified personnel, resulting in increased

<<<

 crew costs, which could constrain our ability to recruit suitable employees to operate our LNG carriers within our budget parameters.
Material increases in crew costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations

<<<

 and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, if we cannot recruit and retain sufficient numbers of quality on-board seafaring personnel, we may not be able to fully utilize our expanded fleet, which

We must make substantial capital expenditures

<<<

 to acquire thefive newbuildings we have on order as ofFebruary 26, 2018, and any additional ships we may acquire in the future.
We are obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to fund our commitments for the five newbuildings we have

<<<

 on order. We are scheduled to take delivery ofthe vessels on various dates between 2018 and 2020. As of December 31,2017, the total remaining balance ofthe contract prices for the four vessels under construction and the GasLogHouston delivered

<<<

 in January 2018 (and not including the contract price of the shipbuilding contract for Hull No. 2213 signed in 2018) was $882.6 million, which amounts are payable under each shipbuilding contract in installments upon the attainment of certain

<<<

 specified milestones. The largest portion of the purchase price for each vessel is payable upon its delivery to us from the shipyard. We intend to partially fund these commitments with the undrawn $664.0 million under the financing agreement

<<<

 we entered into on October 16, 2015 (the "October 2015 Facility"), and with available cash and cash from operations.
To the extent that we are unable to draw down the amounts committed under our credit facilities, whether due to our failure

<<<

 to comply with the terms of such facilities or the lenders' failure to fund the committed amounts, we will need to find alternative financing. If we are unable to find alternative financing, we will not be capable of funding all of our commitments

<<<

 for capital expenditures relating to our four contracted newbuildings. If we fail to meet our payment obligations under a shipbuilding contract, we would be in default under the applicable contract and the shipbuilder would have the option

<<<

 of cancelling the contract and retaining any previously funded installment payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends

<<<

 to our shareholders.
In addition, we may choose to make substantial capital expenditures to expand the size of our fleet and/or to convert existing LNG carriers to FSRUs in the future. We expect to finance the cost of any new vessels through

<<<

 available cash, cash from operations and debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, as well as by

<<<

 adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions, changes in the LNG industry and further contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Even if we are successful in obtaining necessary

<<<

 funds, the terms of any debt financings could limit our ability further to expand our fleet and to pay dividends to our shareholders.
We may have difficultyfurther expanding ourfleet in thefuture.
We may expand our fleet beyond our contracted

<<<

 newbuildings by ordering additional newbuildings or by making selective acquisitions of high-quality secondhand vessels to the extent that they are available in the same way that we acquired the GasLog Chelsea and the eight vessels acquired

<<<

 from MSL in 2014 and 2015. Our future growth will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including our ability to:

·

identify attractive ship acquisition opportunities and consummate such acquisitions;

·

obtain

<<<

 newbuilding contracts at acceptable prices;

·

obtain required equity and debt financing on acceptable terms;

·

secure charter arrangements on terms acceptable to our lenders;

· recruit and retain additional suitably qualified and experienced

·

continue to meet technical and safety perfomiance standards;

·

.

We may not be successful in executing any future growth plans, and we cannot give any assurances that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection with such growth efforts.

Our creditfacilities are secured by our ships

<<<

 and contain payment obligations and restrictive covenants that may restrict our business andfinancing activities as well as our ability to pay dividends. A failure by us to meet our obligations under our creditfacilities could result in an

<<<

 event o f default under such creditfacilities andforeclosure on our ships.

Our credit facilities impose, and any future credit facility we enter into will impose, operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions

<<<

 in our credit facilities generally limit our shipowning subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:

·

incur additional indebtedness, create liens or provide guarantees;

· provide any fomi of credit or financial assistance to, or enter

 the lenders, at a value ofnot less than 120.0% (in the case ofthe October 2015 Facility, 115.0% for the first two years after each drawdown and 120.0% at any time thereafter) ofthe then outstanding amount underthe applicable facility. If we

<<<

 fail to comply with these covenants and are not able to obtain covenant waivers or modifications, our lenders could require us to make prepayments or provide additional collateral sufficient to bring us into compliance with such covenants and

<<<

, if we fail to do so, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness.

Further, GasLog has the NOK2021 Bonds and the US dollar denominated 8.875% Senior Notes which also impose specified financial covenants that apply to us and our subsidiaries

 on a consolidated basis. Underthe temis ofthe NOK2021 Bonds, GasLog is required to comply with the following financial covenants:

· net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-temi debt) must be not less than $0;

· total indebtedness

<<<

 divided by total assets (total indebtedness plus total equity in the case ofthe 8.875% Senior Notes) must not exceed 75.0%;

· the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months

 it holds unencumbered cash and cash equivalents equal to at least 4.0% oftotal

indebtedness, subject to no event of default having occurred or occurring as a consequence ofthe payment o f such dividends; and

·

GasLog's market value adjusted

<<<

 net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.

In addition, the temis ofthe NOK2021 Bonds include a dividend restriction according to which GasLog may not (i) declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash

<<<

 or in kind, (ii) re-purchase any of GasLog's shares or undertake other similar transactions (including, but not limited to, total return swaps related to GasLog's shares), or (iii) grant any loans or make other distributions or transactions

 constituting a transfer of value to GasLog's shareholders (items (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively referred to as the "Distributions") that in aggregate exceed during any calendar year, 50% of GasLog's consolidated net profit aftertaxes based

<<<

 on the audited annual accounts forthe previous financial year(any unutilized portion ofthe pemiitted Distributions pursuant to the above may not be carried forward). Forthe purposes ofthe above, the consolidated net profit aftertaxes ofGasLog

Bonds, GasLog is pemiitted

<<<

 to make Distributions up to a maximum amount per share per annum for the years 2017, 2018, 2019,2020 and 2021 of $1.10/share, $1.10/share, $1.20/share, $1.20/share and $1.20/share, respectively, provided that GasLog can demonstrate by delivering

<<<

 a compliance certificate to the bond trustee that no event of default is continuing or would result front such Distributions.
Underthe terms ofthe 8.875% Senior Notes, GasLog is required to comply with the following financial covenants:
· net

<<<

 working capital (excluding the current portion of long-temi debt) must be not less than $0:
· total indebtedness divided by total indebtedness plus total equity must not exceed 75.0%:
· the ratio of EBITDA over debt service, on a trailing four

 quarter basis, shall be not less than 100.0%:
· the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the higher of 2.50% of total indebtedness or $35.0 million: and
· the issuer's market value adjusted net

<<<

 worth must at all times be not less than $300.0 million.
Certain of our credit facilities also contain vessel employment conditions, pursuant to which we could be required in the event of a charter termination or in certain other circumstances

<<<

 to deposit cash in an account held with the applicable lender until we have obtained a new time charter on temis acceptable to such lender, or under certain of our credit facilities repay the outstanding loan amount.
Our ability to comply with

<<<

 covenants and restrictions contained in our financing arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A failure to comply with covenants and restrictions or to meet

<<<

 our payment and other obligations could lead to defaults under our credit facilities which could cause our payment obligations to be accelerated. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Because

<<<

 obligations under our financing arrangements are secured by our ships and are guaranteed by our ship-owning subsidiaries, if we are unable to repay debt under our financing arrangements, the lenders could seek to foreclose on those assets,

<<<

 which would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, a default under one of our credit facilities could

<<<

 result in the cross-acceleration of our other indebtedness. For mote infomiation regarding our credit facilities, please read "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects--B. Liquidity and Capital Resources--Credit Facilities".
The

<<<

 significant global natural gas and crude oil price volatility, amongst other factors referenced above, have in turn led to a significant shortening of the average duration of spot charters fixed during 2017, as well as a significant decline

<<<

 in average rates for new spot and shorter-term LNG charters commencing promptly. Over the next 18 months, unless LNG charter market conditions improve, we may have difficulty in securing new charters at attractive rates and durations for the

<<<

 five vessels in the Cool Pool. As of December 31,2017, we had a total of 2,833 open vessel days during 2018, including 1,695 days forthe five vessels operating in the Cool Pool. A failure to obtain charters at acceptable rates on these vessels

<<<

 could adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, as well as our ability to meet certain of our debt covenants later in 2018, particularly

<<<

 the required ratio of EBITDA to debt service and the minimum cash requirement.

Ship values mayfluctuate substantially, which could result in an impairment charge, impact our compliance with the covenants in our loan

<<<

 agreements and, if the values are lower at a time when we are attempting to dispose ofships, cause us to incur a loss.
Values for ships can fluctuate substantially overtime due to a number of different factors, including:

· prevailing economic

<<<

 conditions in the natural gas and energy markets:

·

a substantial or extended decline in demand for LNG:

· the level of worldwide LNG production and exports:

·

changes in the supply-demand balance of the global LNG carrier fleet:

·

changes

 in prevailing charter hire rates:

· the physical condition of the ship:

· the size, age and technical specifications ofthe ship: and

· the cost of retrofitting ormodifying existing ships, as a result oftechnological advances in ship design

<<<

 orequipment, changes in applicable environmental or other regulations or standards, customer requirements or otherwise.
Ifthe market value of our ships declines, we may be required to record an impairment charge in our financial statements

<<<

, which could adversely affect our results of operations. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects--B. Liquidity and Capital Resources--Critical Accounting Policies-- Impairment ofVessels". Deterioration in market value of our

<<<

 ships may trigger a breach of some ofthe covenants contained in our credit facilities. If we do breach such covenants and we are unable to remedy the relevant breach, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the

<<<

 ships in our fleet securing those credit facilities. In addition, if a charter contract expires oris terminated by the customer, we may be unable to re-deploy the affected ships at attractive rates and, rather than continue to incur costs to

<<<

 maintain and finance them, we may seek to dispose ofthem. Any foreclosure on our ships, or any disposal by us of a ship at a time when ship prices have fallen, could result in a loss and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial

<<<

 condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders.
Our debt levels may limit ourflexibility in obtaining additionalfinancing, pursuing other business opportunities and paying dividends to

<<<

 our shareholders.
As of December 31,2017, we had an aggregate of $2.55 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreements, the NOK2021 Bonds and the 8.875% Senior Notes, of which $179.4 million was repayable within one year, and

<<<

 a $213.4 million finance lease liability related to the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise, of which $6.3 million was repayable within one year. As of December 31,2017, there was an undrawn available capacity of $100.0 million underthe

<<<

 revolving facility ofthe credit agreement we entered into on July 19, 2016 to refinance the existing indebtedness on eight ofour on-the-water vessels of up to $1,050.0 million (the "Legacy Facility Refinancing"). In addition, there is one loan

<<<

 facility with an aggregate undrawn amount of $664.0 million available that will be used to finance a portion ofthe contract price of three of ournewbuildings on their delivery and the GasLog Houston. We may incur additional indebtedness in

<<<

 the future as we grow our fleet. This level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:

our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, ship acquisitions or

<<<

 other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms:
26

Table of Contents

·

we will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our debt, reducing the funds

<<<

 that would

otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to our shareholders;

· the requirement on us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity as a percentage of our total debt, reducing the funds that

<<<

 would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to our shareholders;

·

our costs of borrowing could increase as we become more leveraged;

·

our debt level may make us more vulnerable than our competitors

<<<

 with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our industry or the

economy generally;

·

our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions; and

·

if we are unable to satisfy the

<<<

 restrictions included in any of our financing agreements orate otherwise in default under any of those

agreements, as a result of our debt levels or otherwise, we will not be able to make cash distributions to you.

Our ability to service

<<<

 our debt depends upon, among otherthings, our future financial and operating perfonuance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.

<<<

 If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets

<<<

, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital orbankmptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory temis, or at all.

Our ability to obtain additional debtfinancing forfuture

<<<

 acquisitions ofships or to refinance our existing debt may depend on the creditworthiness o f our charterers and the terms of ourfuture charters.

Our ability to borrow against the ships in our existing fleet and any ships we may acquire in

<<<

 the future largely depends on the value of the ships, which in turn depends in part on charter hire rates and the ability of our charterers to comply with the temis of their charters. The actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers

<<<

, and any defaults by them, may materially affect our ability to obtain the additional capital resources that we will require to purchase additional ships and to refinance our existing debt as balloon payments come due, or may significantly

<<<

 increase our costs of obtaining such capital. Our inability to obtain additional financing or committing to financing on unattractive temis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and

<<<

 cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

Our ability to pay dividends or to redeem our Preference Shares may be limited by the amount o f cash we generate from operations, by restrictions in our creditfacilities

 and by additionalfactors unrelated to ourprofitability.
We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends. The declaration and payment of any dividend (including cumulative dividends payable with respect to our Preference Shares) is subject to the

<<<

 discretion of our board of directors and the requirements ofBemiuda law. The timing and amount of any dividend or redemption payments will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, restrictions in

 our debt agreements, the provisions ofBemiuda law and other factors. The amount of cash we generate from operations and the actual amount of cash we will

 will vary based upon, among other things:

·

general LNG shipping market conditions and trends, including charter rates, ship values, factors affecting supply and demand, technological

 of LNG carriers:

·

our ability to comply with the specified financial covenants in our loan facilities, NOK2021 Bonds and 8.875% Senior Notes and as corporate

guarantor for certain loan facilities on a consolidated basis:

 such credit facilities and foreclosure on our ships."
The amount of cash we generate from our operations may differ materially front our profit or loss for the period, which will be affected by non-cash items. We may incur other expenses or

<<<

 liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the cash available for dividends.
Under Bemiuda law, a company may not declare or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (i) the company is, or would after the payment be

<<<

, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due: or (ii) the realizable value of the company's assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under our bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends as and when any such

dividends are declared by our board of directors. We may not declare a common dividend if the payment ofourpreference dividends is in arrears.
As a result ofthese and the otherfactors mentioned above, we may pay dividends during

<<<

 periods when we record losses and may not pay dividends during periods when we record a profit. We can give no assurance that dividends will be paid in the future.
We are a holding company and we depend on the ability o f our subsidiaries,

<<<

 including GasLog Partners, to distributefinds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments.
We are a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own all of our operating

<<<

 assets, including our ships. As of February 26,2018, we have no significant assets otherthan the equity interests in our subsidiaries, including GasLog Partners, in which we hold a 25.9% equity interest (including our 2.0% general partner interest

<<<

) as well as all of the incentive distribution rights. As a result, our ability to pay our obligations and to make dividend payments depends entirely on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us, including cash distributions

<<<

 and management and administrative services fees received from GasLog Partners. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, or by the law of its

<<<

 jurisdiction of incorporation which regulates the payment of dividends. Otherfactors which may impact the value of our equity interest in GasLog Partners and its ability to distribute funds to us are described in its public filings with the

<<<

 SEC. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, our board of directors may exercise its discretion not to declare or pay dividends.
Fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates could result infinancial lossesfor us.
Fluctuations

<<<

 in currency exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on our financial performance. We receive virtually all of our revenues in dollars, while some of our operating expenses, including certain employee costs and crew costs, are denominated

<<<

 in euros and in British pounds. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk. However, we also maintain cash balances in euros and British pounds, which amounted to approximately $7.5 million and $5.6 million as of December 31,2017

<<<

. We monitor exchange rate fluctuations on a continuous basis and we also hedge movements in currency exchange rates. However, there is still a risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on our business, financial condition

<<<

, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
In addition, we are exposed to a market risk relating to fluctuations in interest rates because the majority of our credit facilities bear interest

<<<

 costs at a floating rate based on London Interbank Offered Rate, or "LIBOR". On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to

<<<

 submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021 ("FCA Announcement"). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. Significant increases

<<<

 in LIBOR or uncertainty surrounding its phase out after 2021 could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders and ability to service our

<<<

 debt. We use interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, and hedge a portion of our outstanding indebtedness. There is no assurance that our derivative contracts will provide adequate protection against adverse changes

<<<

 in interest rates or that our bank counterparties will be able to perfomi their obligations.
29

The derivative contracts used to hedge our exposure tofluctuations in interest rates could result in reductions in our shareholders

We enter into interest rate swaps front time to time for purposes of managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates applicable to floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31,2017, we

<<<

 had 18 interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of $1.17 billion. The changes in the fair value of the 18 derivative contracts that have not been designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in our statement of profit

<<<

 or loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative contracts that do not qualify for treatment as cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes would affect, among other things, our profit, earnings per share and compliance with the market

<<<

 value adjusted net worth covenants in our credit facilities.
As of December 31,2017, we had three Cross Currency Swaps, or "CCSs", to exchange interest payments and principal on maturity on the same temis as the NOK2021 Bonds, in order to hedge

<<<

 the variability of the functional currency equivalent cash flows on the NOK2021 Bonds. As of December 31,2017, the three CCSs had a notional amount of $90.2 million and qualified as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The

<<<

 effective portion of changes in the fair value of CCSs is recognized in other comprehensive income while the ineffective portion impacts the statement of profit or loss for the period.
We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts front

<<<

 time to time for purposes of managing our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates applicable to payments in foreign currencies (mainly euros and British Pounds Sterling). As of December 31,2017, we had 65 forward foreign exchange

<<<

 contracts in place with an aggregate notional amount of72.0 million and 12 with an aggregate notional amount of £3.6 million. The changes in the fair value of these 77 contracts that have not been designated as cash flow hedging instruments

<<<

 are recognized in our statement of profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative contracts that do not quality for treatment as cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes would affect, among other things, our profit, earnings

<<<

 per share and compliance with the market value adjusted net worth covenants in our credit facilities.
There is no assurance that our derivative contracts will provide adequate protection against adverse changes in interest rates or that our

<<<

 bank counterparties will be able to perform their obligations. In addition, as a result of the implementation of new regulation of the swaps markets in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere over the next few years, the cost and

<<<

 availability of interest rate and currency hedges may increase or suitable hedges may not be available.
Our earnings and business are subject to the credit risk associated with our contractual counterparties.
We enter into, among other things

<<<

, time charters and other contracts with our customers, shipbuilding contracts and refund guarantees relating to newbuildings, credit facilities and commitment letters with banks, insurance contracts and interest rate swaps. Such agreements

<<<

 subject us to counterparty credit risk.
The ability and willingness of each of our counterparties to perfomi its obligations under a contract with us will depend upon a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other

<<<

 things, general economic conditions, the condition of the natural gas and LNG markets and charter hire rates. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us, we could sustain significant losses which in turn could

<<<

 have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

 who are subject to increasing demands as a result o f our growth and who may not necessarily continue to workfor us.
Increasing demands are placed on our management as a result of our growth. As we expand operations, we must monitor our operations

Our Preference Shares are subordinated to our debt obligations and investors' interests

Our Preference Shares are subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness. As of December 31,2017, we had $2.55 billion of outstanding indebtedness

. Our existing indebtedness restricts, and our future indebtedness may include restrictions on, our ability to pay dividends to shareholders. Our memorandum of association and bye-laws currently authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number

<<<

 of preference shares out of the 500,000,000 shares of share capital in one or mote classes or series. The issuance of additional preference shares on a parity with or senior to our Preference Shares would dilute the interests of the holders

<<<

 of our Preference Shares, and any issuance of preference shares senior to or at parity with our Preference Shares or of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on our Preference

The Preference Shares represent perpetual equity interests in us and, unlike our indebtedness, will not give rise to a claim forpayment of

 a principal amount at a particular date. As a result, holders ofthe Preference Shares may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Preference Shares for an indefinite period of time. In addition, the Preference Shares

Tax Risks
In addition to the following risk factors, you should read "Item 10. Additional Infomiation--E. Tax Considerations" fora mote complete discussion of the material Bermuda and U.S. Federal income tax considerations relating to us and

<<<

 the ownership and disposition of our common shares and Preference Shares.
We will have to pay tax on U.S.-source income, which would reduce our earnings.
Underthe United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, orthe "Code", the U

<<<

.S. source gross transportation income of a ship-owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves, is subject to a 4% U.S. Federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption front tax under

<<<

 a tax treaty or Section 883 ofthe Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. U.S. source gross transportation income consists of 50% ofthe gross shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but

<<<

 that does not both begin and end, in the United States.
We do not currently qualify for a tax treaty exemption or a statutory tax exemption, and therefore we are subject to the 4% U.S. Federal income tax described above. We do not expect any

<<<

 resulting U.S. tax liability to be material or materially reduce the earnings available for distribution to our shareholders for the fiscal years ended December 31,2017 and December 31,2018. For 2017, the U.S. source gross transportation tax

<<<

 was $0.7 million. Changes to ourbusiness could change this expectation and in such circumstances, we may attempt to qualify forthe exemption front tax under Section 883. Fora more detailed discussion, see the section entitled "Item 10. Additional

If we were treated as a "passiveforeign investment company", certain adverse US. Federal income

<<<

 tax consequences could result to US. shareholders.
A foreign corporation will be treated as a "passive foreign investment company", or "PFIC", forU.S. Federal income tax purposes if at least 75% of its gross income for any tax year consists

<<<

 of certain types of "passive income", or at least 50% of the average value of the corporation's assets produce orate held forthe production ofthose types of "passive income". Forpurposes ofthese tests, "passive income" includes dividends, interest

<<<

, gains front the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties that are received front unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. Forpurposes ofthese tests

<<<

, income derived front the perfonuance of services does not constitute "passive income". U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. Federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions

<<<

 they receive front the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive front the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC. If we are treated as a PFIC for any tax year, we will provide infomiation to U.S. shareholders who request such infomiation

<<<

 to enable them to make certain elections to alleviate certain of the adverse U.S. Federal income tax consequences that would arise as a result of holding an interest in a PFIC.
Based on our method of operation, we do not believe that we are

<<<

 a PFIC for this tax year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive front our time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income front

<<<

 our time chartering activities does not constitute "passive income", and the assets that we own and operate to produce that income do not constitute passive assets.
There is, however, no legal authority underthe PFIC rules addressing ourproposed

<<<

 method of operation. Accordingly, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the "IRS", or a court of law may not accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS ora court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, we could constitute

<<<

 a PFIC for a future tax year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations.
Ifthe IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any tax year, U.S. shareholders would face adverse tax consequences. Underthe PFIC

<<<

 rules, unless those shareholders make certain elections available underthe Code, such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. Federal income tax at the then prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions

<<<

 and upon any gain front the disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder's holding period. Please read "Item 10. Additional Information--E. Tax

ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY
A. History and Development o f the Company
GasLog was incorporated in Bermuda on July 16, 2003. GasLog and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the ownership, operation and

<<<

 management of vessels in the LNG market, providing maritime services forthe transportation of LNG on a worldwide basis and LNG vessel management services. The Group conducts its operations through its vessel-owning subsidiaries and through

<<<

 its vessel management services subsidiary.
Our company and its founders have a long history in shipping and in LNG carriers. Our largest shareholder is Ceres Shipping, whose founding family's shipping activities commenced mote than 100 years

<<<

 ago and which is currently controlled by our Chairman, Peter G. Livanos. Ceres Shipping
35

Table of Contents
owns its shareholding in GasLog through its wholly owned subsidiary, Blenheim Holdings Ltd. ("Blenheim Holdings"). Ceres Shipping

<<<

 entered the LNG sector in 2001 by undertaking the management ofBG Group's owned fleet of LNG carriers through our subsidiary GasLog LNG Services, and in 2003 GasLog Ltd. was incorporated. Until 2010, when we took delivery ofthe GasLog Savannah

<<<

 and the GasLog Singapore, our business principally consisted of providing technical ship management services, as well as plan approval and constmction supervision services fornewbuilding LNG carriers. As a result, we have had a longer presence

<<<

 in LNG shipping than many other independent owners currently operating in the sector. Fora description of our historical and current capital expenditures, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects--B. Liquidity and Capital Resources

<<<

--Capital Expenditures".
On April 4, 2012, we completed our initial public offering, or "IPO", and our common shares began trading on the NYSE on March 30, 2012 underthe ticker symbol "GLOG". On January 22,2014, GasLog completed a follow-on

<<<

 public offering of 10,925,000 common shares (including 1,425,000 common shares in relation to the over-allotment option exercised in full by the underwriters) and a concurrent private placement of 2,317,460 common shares at the public offering

<<<

 price to certain of its directors and officers and one of its major shareholders. The offering and private placement resulted in net proceeds of $199.0 million which were used to partially finance the acquisition ofthe first three ships acquired

<<<

 front MSL in 2014. On April 16, 2014, GasLog completed a second follow-on public offering o f4,887,500 common shares (including 637,500 common shares in relation to the over-allotment option exercised in full by the underwriters). The offering

<<<

 resulted in net proceeds of $109.9 million which were used to partially finance the acquisition ofthe additional three ships acquired froniMSL in 2014.
On May 12, 2014, our subsidiary GasLog Partners completed an IPO o f9,660,000 common units

<<<

 (including 1,260,000 units in relation to the overallotment option exercised in full by the underwriters), resulting in net proceeds of $186.0 million. GasLog Partners is a Marshall Islands master limited partnership fomied by us to own and

<<<

 operate LNG carriers under multi-year charters. Its common units representing limited partner interests are traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "GLOP". Concurrently with the initial public offering, GasLog Partners acquired a 100.0%

<<<

 ownership interest in GASthree Ltd., GAS-four Ltd. and GAS-five Ltd., the entities that owned the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago and the GasLog Sydney, front GasLog, in exchange for(i) 162,358 common units and 9,822,358 subordinated units

<<<

 issued to GasLog representing a 49.8% ownership interest and all ofthe incentive distribution rights that entitle GasLog to increasing percentages ofthe cash that the Partnership distributes in excess of $0.43125 per unit per quarter, (ii)

<<<

 400,913 general partner units issued to GasLog Partners GP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog, representing a 2.0% general partner interest and (iii) $65.7 million of cash consideration paid directly to us front the offering proceeds

<<<

. In addition to the cash consideration of $65.7 million paid to us, GasLog Partners used the $186.0 million net proceeds of its IPO to (a) prepay $82.6 million of debt plus accrued interest of $0.4 million and (b) make a payment of $2.3 million

<<<

 (including $0.3 million accrued interest) to settle the mark-to-market loss on termination of one interest rate swap and reduction of a second interest rate swap in connection with the aforementioned debt prepayment. The balance of $35.0 million

On April 7, 2015, GasLog completed a public offering of 4,600,000 Preference Shares, par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference $25.00 per share and priced

<<<

 at $25.00 per share, including 600,000 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters oftheir option to purchase additional Preference Shares. The net proceeds front the offering after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions

<<<

 and other offering expenses were $110.7 million to be used for general corporate purposes. The Preference Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange underthe symbol "GLOG PR A".

As of February 26,2018, GasLog holds a 25.9% interest in

<<<

 the Partnership and, as a result of its ownership ofthe general partner and the fact that the general partner elects the majority ofthe Partnership's directors in accordance with the Partnership's partnership agreement, or the "Partnership

<<<

 Agreement", GasLog has the ability to control the Partnership's affairs and policies. Consequently, GasLog Partners is consolidated in the Group's financial statements. The Group's control ofthe general partner and consequently ofthe Partnership

<<<

 could be challenged with a 66.67% vote by other unitholders. However, as the Partnership Agreement limits any single unitholderto a maximum of 4.9% ofthe vote, it is highly unlikely that a coordinated vote of widely held unitholders will be

<<<

 organized to change the Group's control ofthe general partner. As a result, the Group continues to assume that control ofthe general partner is a relevant basis on which to conclude control ofthe Partnership.

As described elsewhere herein

<<<

, GasLog Partners holds options to acquire from GasLog an additional four vessels and GAS-twenty six Ltd. with its long term bareboat charter of (and right to acquire) the Methane Julia Louise (which is subject to a multi-year charter to MSL

<<<

). In general, we would expect the exercise of these options to be beneficial to GasLog, as any external equity capital raised by GasLog Partners to finance the acquisition can be expected to reduce our consolidated indebtedness and, if GasLog

<<<

 Partners increases its per unit distributions, increase the return on our incentive distribution rights (although our common unit interest will be diluted by any GasLog Partners equity issuance). GasLog Partners will detemiine whether, and

<<<

 when, to exercise any ofthe options and

37

Table of Contents
rights that it holds. The timing of those decisions will depend in part on the price and availability of debt and equity financing to GasLog Partners. See "Item 7. Major Shareholders

<<<

 and Related Party Transactions--B. Related Party Transactions--Relationship with GasLog Partners--Omnibus Agreement".
On October 1,2015, GasLog, Dynagas and Golar established the Cool Pool to market their vessels which are currently operating

<<<

 in the LNG shipping spot market. The Cool Pool allows the participating owners to optimize the operation of the pool vessels through improved scheduling ability, cost efficiencies and common marketing. The objective of the Cool Pool is to serve

<<<

 the transportation requirements of a rapidly growing LNG shipping market by providing customers with reliable, flexible and innovative solutions to meet their increasingly complex shipping requirements.
As of February 26,2018, the Cool Pool

<<<

 consists of 18 modern high quality and essentially equivalent vessels with TFDE propulsion. The three owners' vessels eligible for participation in the Cool Pool are as follows: GasLog: five vessels: Dynagas: three vessels: and Golar: ten vessels

<<<

. Each vessel owner continues to be fully responsible for the manning and technical management of its respective vessels. The Cool Pool focuses on charters of less than 12 months' duration. The scheduling of employment opportunities in excess

<<<

 of 12 months will remain the mandate ofthe respective vessel owner. Ifa Cool Pool vessel is scheduled by an owner fora charter that exceeds 12 months in duration, such vessel will cease to be part ofthe Cool Pool.
We maintain our principal

<<<

 executive offices at Gildo Pastor Center, 7 Rue du Gabian, MC 98000, Monaco. Our telephone number at that address is +377 97 97 51 15. We are registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda under registration number 3392 8. We maintain

<<<

 a registered office in Bermuda at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda.
B. Business Overview
Overview
We are an international owner, operator and manager of LNG carriers providing support to international energy companies

<<<

 as part of their LNG logistics chain. Our owned and bareboat fleet as of February 26, 2018, consists of 29 LNG carriers, including 24 ships on the water and five LNG carriers on order at two ofthe world's leading LNG shipbuilders, Samsung and

<<<

 Hyundai. This includes 12 LNG carriers in operation that are owned by our NYSE-listed subsidiary GasLog Partners, with which we have entered into certain agreements governing our relationship, including purchase options for certain of our ships

<<<

. We currently manage and operate 24 LNG carriers including 11 of our wholly owned ships in operation, 11 ships contributed or sold to the Partnership (one is managed by a subsidiary of Shell), one additional LNG carrier in which we have a 

<<<

25.0% interest and a vessel secured under a long-term bareboat charter front Lepta Shipping, a subsidiary ofMitsui. We are also supervising the construction of ournewbuildings. We have secured multi-year contracts for six of our owned ships

<<<

, the 12 ships owned by the Partnership, four of our five newbuildings on order and the one vessel secured under a long-temi bareboat charter with Lepta Shipping. As of December 31,2017, these contracts are expected to provide total contracted

<<<

 revenues of $3.1 billion during their initial terms, which expire between 2018 and 2029.
The LNG carrier in which we have a 25.0% interest is the Methane Nile Eagle, a 2007-built LNG carrier technically managed by us that is currently operating

<<<

 under a 20-year time charter to MSL.
Our current time charters have initial terms of up to ten years and include options that pemiit the charterers to extend the terms for successive periods under hire rate provisions. We will continue to evaluate

<<<

 the attractiveness of longer and shorter-temi chartering opportunities as the commercial characteristics ofthe LNG carrier industry evolve. We have structured our order book of new LNG carriers to have staggered delivery dates, facilitating

<<<

 a smooth integration ofthe ships into our fleet as
38

Table of Contents
well as significant annual growth through 2020. This has the additional advantage of spreading our exposure to the re-employment of these ships over several years upon

<<<

 expiration of their current charters.
Each of our 29 owned and bareboat LNG carriers is designed with a capacity of between approximately 145,000 cbm and 180,000 cbm. We believe this size range maximizes their operational flexibility as these

<<<

 ships are compatible with most existing LNG temiinals around the world. All but one of the LNG carriers in our owned and bareboat fleet are of similar specifications (in groups often, seven, four, four, two and two ships), which allows us to

<<<

 benefit from economies of scale and operating efficiencies in ship construction, crew training, crew rotation and shared spare parts. Upon delivery of the last of our five contracted newbuildings, our owned and bareboat fleet will have an average

<<<

 age of 6.9 years, making it one of the youngest in the industry. By comparison, as of December31,2017, the average age forthe global fleet ofLNG carriers, including LNG carriers of all sizes, was 10.4 years.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, GasLog

<<<

 LNG Services, exclusively handles the technical management of our fleet, including plan approval fornew ship orders, supervision o f ship construction and planning and supervision of dry-dockings, as well as technical operations, crewing, training

<<<

, maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and health, safety, security and environmental, or "HSSE", management and reporting. As the sole technical manager of BG Group's owned fleet ofLNG carriers for over 15 years, we have established

<<<

 a track record forthe efficient, safe and reliable operation ofLNG carriers which is evidenced by our safety perfonuance and the limited off-hire days of the 25 ships currently operating under our management.
fn 2017, GasLog continued the development

<<<

 of an FSRU business, acting on its strategic decision to enter this business segment.
At the end of 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary ofGasLog acquired a 20% shareholding in Gastrade. Gastrade is licensed to develop an independent natural gas

<<<

 system offshore Alexandraupolis in Northern Greece utilizing a FSRU along with other fixed infrastructure. In March 2017, Gastrade launched a Front End Engineering and Design ("FEED") study with Wood Group and GasLog as subcontractor for the

<<<

 FSRU part of the study. The FEED study was finalized in August 2017, continuing the selected offshore concept.
On October 12, 2017, Gastrade and the Greek state-owned gas company, DEPA, signed a cooperation agreement for DEPA's participation

<<<

 in the development ofthe Alexandroupolis terminal. The agreement includes steps forthe acquisition o f shares in Gastrade by DEPA and a list of common efforts of the parties forthe further commercial development ofthe project.
On February 

<<<

23,2018, a wholly owned subsidiary ofGasLog executed an FSRU Operation and Maintenance Agreement with Gastrade. This agreement is tied to the Terminal Use Agreement and subject to final investment decision ("FID") ofthe Alexandroupolis Project

<<<

.
In March 2017, we signed an agreement with Samsung to commence an FSRU engineering process including the purchase ofregasification equipment with long lead times (so-called Long Lead Items). In August, Keppel Shipyard commenced detailed engineering

<<<

 forthe conversion ofthe GasLog Chelsea, one of our 153,600 cbmTFDE vessels into an FSRU. This will be finalized in March 2018.

. Following the forthcoming substitution ofthe GasLog Salem forthe GasLog Skagen, the GasLog Skagen is due to come off charter in the third quarter of 2018 while the GasLog Salem is due to come off charter in September 2019. GasLog Partners

<<<

 and GasLog continue to pursue opportunities for new multi-year charters with third parties forthe vessels and, on an interim basis, may consider trading the vessels in the spot market, pursuing the most advantageous redeployment depending on

<<<

 evolving market conditions. It should be noted that forthe GasLog Sydney, GasLog Partners has the option to enter into a bareboat charter or time charter arrangement with GasLog designed to guarantee the total cash available for distribution

Key Fleet Characteristics
The key characteristics of our current owned and bareboat fleet include the following:

·

each ship is sized at between approximately 145,000 cbm and 180,000 cbm capacity, which places our ships in the medium- to

<<<

 large-size class

of LNG carriers: we believe this size range maximizes their operational flexibility, as these ships are compatible with most existing LNG

terminals around the world and have competitive levels of LNG boil-off:

·

each ship

<<<

 is double-hulled, which is standard in the LNG industry:

·

each ship has a membrane containment system incorporating current industry construction standards, including guidelines and

recommendations front Gaztransport and Technigaz (the

<<<

 designer ofthe membrane system) as well as updated standards front our classification

society:

·

each of our ships is modem steam powered or has TFDE or LP-2S engine propulsion technology:

·

Bemtuda is the flag state of each ship:

·


<<<


each of our delivered ships has received, and each of ournewbuildings is expected to receive, an ENVIRO+notation front our classification

society, which denotes compliance with its published guidelines concerning the most stringent criteria

<<<

 for environmental protection related to

design characteristics, management and support systems, sea discharges and air emissions: and

·

upon delivery ofthe last of our five contracted newbuildings in 2020, our owned fleet will have an average

<<<

 age of 6.9 years, making it one of

the youngest in the industry, compared to a current average age of 10.4 years forthe global LNG carrierfleet including LNG carriers of all sizes

as of December 31,2017.

In addition to our owned and bareboat

<<<

 fleet, we have a 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG, an entity whose principal asset is the Methane Nile Eagle. The Methane Nile Eagle is a 145,000 cbm LNG carrier that was built in 2007. It is currently chartered to MSL under a 20-year

<<<

 time charter, which is subject to extension for up to 10 years at the charterer's option.

We continually evaluate short and long-temi charter opportunities for our vessels, including the newbuildings for which we do not currently have charters

<<<

 fixed. Our discussions with potential charterers are at various stages of advancement: however, we cannot provide assurance that we will conclude any particular charter or, if concluded, as to the charter rate that will apply.

Managed Fleet

<<<



Through GasLog LNG Services, we provide technical ship management services for one LNG carrier owned by a third party in addition to management ofthe 23 LNG carriers currently operating in

42

Table of Contents

our owned and bareboat fleet

Ship Time Charters

We provide the services of our ships undertime charters.

<<<

 A time charter is a contract for the use of the ship fora specified term at a daily hire rate. Under a time charter, the ship ownerprovides crewing and other services related to the ship's operation, the cost of which is covered by the hire

<<<

 rate, and the customer is responsible for substantially all of the ship voyage costs (including bunker fuel, port charges, canal fees and LNG boil-off).

We entered into four master time charters with MSL that established the general temis

<<<

 under which the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago, the GasLog Sydney, the GasLog Skagen, the GasLog Greece, the GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog Geneva, the GasLog Gibraltar, the GasLog Houston and the two newbuildings identified by Hull No. 

<<<

2130 and Hull No. 2131 will be chartered to MSL. We enter into separate confirmation memorandums for each ship in order to supplement the master time charter and specify the charter term, extension options (if any), hire rate and other provisions

<<<

 applicable to each ship's charter. For the six vessels acquired from MSL in 2014, the two vessels acquired in 2015 and the GasLog Savannah, we entered into separate time charters for each vessel.

We have entered into time charter agreements

<<<

 with a subsidiary of Shell, establishing the temis under which the GasLog Seattle and the Solaris will be chartered to Shell.

The GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Saratoga, the GasLog Salem, the GasLog Singapore and the GasLog Savannah are operating

<<<

 in the Cool Pool and from time to time enter into short-temi time charters. On December6, 2017, a deed ofnovation and amendment ofthe charterparty agreement ofthe GasLog Skagen was signed between GasLog and Shell to substitute the GasLog Salem

<<<

 for the GasLog Skagen in the execution ofthe charterparty. The substitution will take effect after the completion ofthe dry-docking ofthe GasLog Skagen in the third quarter of 2018. On completion ofthe substitution it is expected that the GasLog

<<<

 Skagen will operate in the Cool Pool.

We have entered into a time charter agreement with a subsidiary of Total, establishing the terms under which Hull No. 2801 will be chartered to Total.

We have entered into a time charter agreement with

<<<

 Centrica establishing the temis under which Hull No. 2213 will be chartered to Centrica.

The following discussion describes the material temis of the time charters for our owned and bareboat ships.
Initial Term, Extensions

<<<

 and Redelivery
The initial terms ofthe time charters forthe GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago and the GasLog Sydney began upon delivery ofthe ships and will all terminate in 2018. The charterer had options to extend each ofthese charters

<<<

, although none ofthese options has been exercised. The initial term ofthe charter for the GasLog Skagen began upon delivery ofthe ship and continues until approximately July 2018, at which time she will redeliver to GasLog in exchange for the

<<<

 GasLog Salem, which shall then remain on charter until September 2019.
The initial term ofthe time charters forthe Methane Lvdon Volney, the Methane Rita Andrea, the Methane Jane Elizabeth, the Methane Shirley Elisabeth, the Methane Alison

<<<

 Victoria and the Methane Heather Sally began upon delivery to GasLog following their acquisition front MSL in 2014, and will terminate on various dates in 2019 and 2020. Forthe Methane Rita Andrea, the Methane Lydon Volney, the Methane Shirley

<<<

 Elisabeth and the Methane Heather Sally, MSL has the option to extend the term ofthe time charter fora period of either three or five years beyond the initial charter expiration date.
The initial term ofthe time charter for the GasLog Greece

<<<

, the GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog Geneva and the GasLog Gibraltar began upon delivery of the ships and will terminate in 2026, 2026,2023 and 2023, respectively. Forthe GasLog Greece and the GasLog Glasgow, MSL has options to extend the terms

<<<

 ofthe charters for up to five years and forthe GasLog Geneva and the GasLog Gibraltar, MSL has the option to extend the terms ofthe charters for up to 8 years.
The GasLog Houston was delivered front the shipyard in January 2018 and is on charter

<<<

 to a major LNG producer for up to three months, and delivers into her time charter with MSL in 2019. The initial charter term forthe ship will terminate in 2028. MSL has options to extend the terms ofthe charter for two consecutive periods

<<<

 of three years each, all at specified hire rates.
Our time charters to MSL for Hull No. 2130 and Hull No. 2131 will begin shortly after the delivery ofthe vessels in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The initial charter terms forthe ships will terminate

<<<

 for Hull No. 2130 in 2027 and for Hull No. 2131 in 2029. MSL has options to extend terms ofthe charters for Hulls No. 2130 and Hull No. 2131 for two consecutive periods of three years each, all at specified hire rates.
The initial term ofthe

<<<

 time charter for the GasLog Seattle and the Solaris began upon delivery ofthe ships following an initial period during which the ships operated under maiden voyage time charters, the purpose ofwhich was to facilitate completion by Shell of

<<<

 an operational discharge inspection ofthe ships. The time charters forthe GasLog Seattle and the Solaris will terminate in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In each case, Shell has options to extend the charter terms for periods ranging front five

<<<

 to ten years at specified hire rates.
The initial term ofthe time charters forthe Methane Becki Anne and the Methane Julia Louise began upon delivery to GasLog and will terminate in 2024 and 2026. MSL will have options to extend the term ofthe

<<<

 time charter for the Methane Becki Anne and the long-term bareboat charter ofthe Methane Julia Louise which is now owned by Lepta Shipping and leased back to GasLog, foran additional period of either three orfive years beyond the initial charter

<<<

 expiration date.
Our time charter to Total for Hull No. 2801 will begin upon delivery ofthe ship. The initial charter term will terminate in 2025. Total has the option to extend the term ofthe charter by a three-year period at the charterer

<<<

's option at a specified hire rate.
44

Table of Contents
Our time charter to Centrica for Hull No. 2213 will begin upon delivery of the vessel in 2020. The initial charter temi will terminate in 2027. Centrica has the option to extend the

<<<

 term of the charter by three consecutive periods of two years each at the charterer's option.
The terms and period for fixtures of the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Saratoga and the GasLog Salem vary

<<<

 front charter to charter, as is the nature of trading in the spot market.
Our time charters provide for redelivery ofthe ship to us at the expiration of the term, as such temi may be extended upon the charterer's exercise of its extension options

<<<

, or upon earlier tennination ofthe charter (as described below) plus or minus 30 days. Under all of our charters, the charterer has the right to extend the temi for most periods in which the ship is off-hire. Our charter contracts do not provide

<<<

 the charterers with options to purchase our ships during or upon expiration ofthe charter term.
Hire Rate Provisions
"Hire rate" refers to the basic payment from the customer for use of the ship. Under all of our time charters, the hire rate

<<<

 is payable to us monthly in advance in U.S. dollars. Depending on the time charter contract, there are three methods by which the daily hire rate for our owned ships is detemiined:
· Underthe first method, the hire rate includes two components

<<<

: a capital cost component and an operating cost component. The capital cost component relates to the total cost ofthe ship's construction and is a fixed daily amount that is structured to provide a return on our invested capital. Some ofthe

<<<

 charters provide forthe capital cost component to increase by a specified amount during any option period. The operating cost component is a fixed daily amount that increases annually at a fixed percentage. Although the daily amount ofthe operating

<<<

 cost component is fixed (subject to a specified annual increase), it is intended to correspond to the costs of operating the ship and related expenses. In the event of a material increase or decrease in the actual costs we incur in operating

<<<

 the ship, a clause in the charter provides each party the right in certain circumstances to seek a review and potential adjustment ofthe operating cost component.
· Underthe second method, the hire rate includes only one component that is a

<<<

 fixed daily amount that will either remain the same, increase or decrease by a specified amount during any option period as compared to the firm period.
· Under the third method, the hire rate for an initial period of up to two years, at the

<<<

 charterer's option, will be set at the prevailing market rate for a comparable ship, subject to a cap and a floor. Following such initial period, the hire rate will be calculated based on three components--a capital cost component, an operating

<<<

 cost component and a ship management fee. The capital cost component is a fixed daily amount which will increase by a specified amount during any option period. The daily amount ofthe operating cost component, which is intended to fully pass

<<<

-through to the chartererthe costs of operating the ship, is set annually and adjusted at the end of each yearto compensate us forthe actual costs we incur in operating the ship. Dry-docking expenses are budgeted in advance and are reimbursed

<<<

 by the charterers immediately following a dry-docking. The ship management fee is a daily amount set in line with industry practice for fees charged by ship managers and is intended to compensate us for management ofthe ship.
The hire rates

<<<

 foreach ofour ships may be reduced if the ship does not perform to certain ofits specifications orifwe breach our obligations underthe charter. We have had no instances of hire rate reductions since the first two of our owned ships commenced

<<<

 operations in 2010.
45

Table of Contents
Off-Hire
When a ship is "off-hire"--or not available for service--a time charterer generally is not required to pay the hire rate, and we remain responsible for all costs, including the cost of any

<<<

 LNG cargo lost as boil-off during such otf-hire periods. Our time charters provide an annual allowance period for us to schedule preventative maintenance work on the ship. A ship generally will be deemed otf-hire underourtime charters if there

<<<

 is a specified time outside of the annual allowance period when the ship is not available forthe charterer's use due to, among otherthings, operational deficiencies (including the failure to maintain a certain guaranteed speed), dry-docking

<<<

 forrepairs, maintenance orinspection, equipment breakdowns, deficiency ofpersonnel or neglect of duty by the ship's officers or crew, deviation from course, or delays due to accidents, quarantines, ship detentions or similar problems. We have

<<<

 obtained loss of hire insurance to protect us against loss of income as a result of a ship being off-hire. See "--Risk of Loss, Insurance and Risk Management--Loss of Hire Insurance".
All ships are dry-docked at least once every five years

<<<

 for a special survey as required by the ship's classification society. Our ships are considered to be off-hire underourtime charters during such periods.
Termination and Cancellation
Under our existing time charters, each party has certain

<<<

 temiination rights which include, among otherthings, the automatic tennination of a charter upon loss of the relevant ship. Either party may elect to temiinate a charter upon the occurrence of specified defaults or upon the outbreak of war

<<<

 or hostilities involving two orniore major nations, such as the United States orthe People's Republic ofChina, if such war or hostilities materially and adversely affect the trading of the ship for a period of at least 30 days. In addition

<<<

, our charterers have the option to temiinate a charter if the relevant ship is off-hire for any reason other than scheduled dry-docking for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days, or for more than 90 days or 110 days, depending on the charter

<<<

, in any one-year period. Certain of our charters give the charterer a temiination option for shorter periods of off-hire, if such off-hire is due to an uncured breach of our obligations to maintain the applicable ship.
In addition to its termination

<<<

 rights, Shell has the right to convert the time charter with respect to the relevant ship into a bareboat charter upon the occurrence of specified defaults or in the event that Shell's quality assurance review is not successfully completed

<<<

 upon delivery of the ship.
All ofthe time charters applicable to ournewbuildings pemiit the chartererto cancel the charter in the event of a prolonged delay in the delivery ofthe ship from the shipyard, and in certain circumstances obligate

<<<

 us to pay liquidated damages to the charterer in the event of a less significant delivery delay. However, the cancellation and liquidated damages provisions in our charters are structured to mirror the provisions of our contracts with the shipyard

<<<

, giving us the right to receive liquidated damages from the shipyard or cancel the shipbuilding contract in the same circumstances that would trigger the charterer's right to cancel the charter contract orreceive liquidated damages because

<<<

 of delivery delays.
The Cool Pool
Five of our vessels are operating as part ofthe Cool Pool established in October 2015 with Dynagas and Golar. The Cool Pool was established to market certain of each company's vessels which are currently operating

<<<

 in the LNG shipping spot market. The Cool Pool allows the participating owners to optimize the operation ofthe pool vessels through improved scheduling ability, cost efficiencies and common marketing. The objective ofthe Cool Pool is to serve

<<<

 the transportation requirements of a rapidly growing LNG shipping market by providing customers with reliable, flexible and innovative solutions to meet their increasingly complex shipping requirements.
46

Table of Contents

As of February

<<<

 26,2018, the Cool Pool consists of 18 modern high quality and essentially equivalent vessels powered by fuel efficient TFDE propulsion technology. The three owners' vessels eligible for participation in the Cool Pool are as follows: GasLog

<<<

: five vessels: Dynagas: three vessels: and Golar: ten vessels. Each vessel owner continues to be fully responsible for the manning and technical management of its respective vessels.

The Cool Pool focuses on charters of 12 months' duration

<<<

 or less. The scheduling of employment opportunities in excess of 12 months will remain the mandate ofthe respective vessel owner. Ifa Cool Pool vessel is scheduled by an ownerfora charterthat exceeds 12 months in duration, such vessel will

<<<

 cease to be part ofthe Cool Pool. Gross pool revenues represent time charter revenues earned by GasLog vessels participating in the pool under charter agreements where GasLog contracts directly with charterers. Revenue is recognised on a monthly

<<<

 basis given that, when the vessel is made available and services are provided to the charterer during the period, the amount can be estimated reliably and collection ofthe related revenue is reasonably assured.

Voyage expenses and commissions

<<<

 include the net allocation front the pool which represents GasLog's share ofthe net revenues earned front the other pool participants' vessels less the other participants' share ofthe net revenues earned by GasLog's vessels included in the

<<<

 pool. Each participant's share ofthe net pool revenues is based on the number of pool points attributable to its vessels and the number of days such vessels participated in the pool.

The Bareboat Charter

On February 24, 2016, GasLog's subsidiary

<<<

, GAS-twenty six Ltd., completed the sale and leaseback ofthe Methane Julia Louise with Lepta Shipping. Lepta Shipping has the right to on-sell and lease back the vessel. The vessel was sold to Lepta Shipping fora total consideration approximately

<<<

 equivalent to its current book value. GasLog has leased back the vessel under a bareboat charter front Lepta Shipping for a period of up to 20 years. GasLog has the option to re-purchase the vessel on pte-agreed temis no earlier than the end

<<<

 of year ten and no later than the end of year 17 ofthe bareboat charter. The vessel remains on its 11 year charter with MSL.

Shipbuilding Contracts

We have entered into shipbuilding contracts with Samsung and Hyundai in respect of four and

<<<

 one newbuildings, respectively, which have an aggregate contract price of approximately $1.03 billion. As of December 31,2017, the aggregate outstanding balance, including the outstanding installments for the GasLog Houston delivered in 20

<<<

18 and excluding the contract price ofthe shipbuilding contract for Hull No. 2213 which was signed in 2018, was $882.6 million, which will be paid in installments upon steel cutting, keel laying and launching ofthe ship, with the largest portion

<<<

 ofthe purchase price for each ship coming due upon its delivery. All of our obligations under the shipbuilding contracts are payable in U.S. dollars.

As ofDecember31,2017, our remaining payment obligations underthe shipbuilding contracts were

<<<

 as follows:

47

Table of Contents
The shipbuilding contracts provide for the five newbuildings to be delivered and ready for immediate operation on various dates in 2018 through 2020. The shipbuilding contracts require Samsung and Hyundai to pay

<<<

 us liquidated damages in the event of certain delays in the delivery of a ship unless such delays are attributable to a force majeure event, and in the event of a prolonged delay we would have the right to cancel the contract and receive a

<<<

 refund of any installment payments previously made on the ship.
In the event that we fail to meet ourpayment obligations undera shipbuilding contract, we would be in default underthe applicable contract and would be obligated to pay interest

<<<

 underthe contract. If such a default by us were to continue for mote than five business days, the delivery date of the applicable ship would be delayed by one day for each day that we remain in default, and if a default by us were to continue

<<<

 for more than 15 business days, Samsung and Hyundai would have the option of cancelling the applicable shipbuilding contract and retaining any installment payments previously funded by us under the contract.
Ship Management Services and Construction

<<<

 Supervision
Except for the Solaris, which is managed by a subsidiary of Shell, management of our owned fleet, which includes plan approval for new ship orders, supervision of ship construction and planning and supervision of dry-dockings, as

<<<

 well as technical operations, crewing, training, maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and HSSE management and reporting, is provided in-house by our wholly owned subsidiary, GasLog LNG Services, an entity incorporated in Bermuda

<<<

 with an office in Piraeus, Greece. In addition to management of our owned and bareboat fleet, through GasLog LNG Services we provide technical ship management services for the Methane Nile Eagle, a ship in which we have a 25.0% ownership interest

<<<

. During the year ended December 31,2017, ship management services provided to external customers accounted for approximately 0.2% of our consolidated revenues.
Construction Supervision
We supervise and manage the constmction of ournewbuildings

<<<

 through GasLog LNG Services. We have employees on-site in South Korea whose responsibilities include inspecting the ships under construction for non-conformities, attending trials of the ship and its machinery and equipment, consulting with

<<<

 the shipyard in the event of any modifications to the ship's specifications, reviewing the shipyard's choice of suppliers and sub-contractors and keeping our management informed ofthe progress ofthe constmction. Through GasLog LNG Services

<<<

, we also supervised the construction ofthree LNG carriers in Shell's owned fleet and the Methane Nile Eagle, all of which were constructed at Samsung.
Technical and Operational Management
Pursuant to ship management agreements, through GasLog

<<<

 LNG Services we manage the day-to-day aspects of ship operations, including crewing, training, employing amied guards fortransport in certain high-risk areas, insurance, maintenance and repair, procurement of supplies and equipment, regulatory

<<<

 and classification compliance and HSSE management and reporting, as well as dry-docking under certain charters, for our owned and bareboat fleet (with the exception ofthe Solaris) and for the Methane Nile Eagle owned by Egypt LNG. We utilize

<<<

 certain third-party sub-contractors and suppliers in carrying out ourtechnical management responsibilities. In the case of ships owned by Egypt LNG and Lepta Shipping, the crewing and other operational costs are fully passed-through to the

<<<

 ship owner, and the customers pay us a management fee per ship per month for our technical management services.
In connection with our ship management services, we also enter into consultant service agreements pursuant to which we provide specialized

<<<

 services relating to the management of LNG carriers. These
48

Table of Contents
services include the development and installation of a ship's ship management system, which includes installing onboard hardware and software systems and providing

<<<

 related training to the ship's personnel.
The terms of our ship management agreements and related contracts pemiit the customer to temiinate our services for any reason upon a short period of advance notice, and both parties have tennination

<<<

 rights upon the occurrence of specified defaults. In the event ofthe loss o fa ship, orthe owner's sale ofa ship to a third party, the ship management agreement in respect ofthe ship would terminate automatically.
Competition
We operate in

<<<

 markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand. Generally, competition forLNG time charters is based primarily on price, ship availability, size, age, technical specifications and condition, LNG shipping experience

<<<

, quality and efficiency of ship operations, shipping industry relationships and reputation for customer service, and technical ability and reputation for operation of highly specialized ships. In addition, through the GasLog Singapore, the

<<<

 GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Saratoga and the GasLog Salem we operate in the spot market that covers short-term charters of less than one year.
Although we believe that we are one ofa small number of owners that continue

<<<

 to focus on newly-built, technically advanced LNG carriers and provide in-house technical management ofthe fleet, other independent shipping companies also own, operate and, in some cases, manage LNG carriers and have new ships under construction

<<<

. There are other ship owners and managers, and potential new entrants, who may also attempt to participate in the LNG market in the future. We believe that our strategy offocusing on charter contracts with initial terms offive to ten years

<<<

, as well as the scale ofourtechnical ship management operations, differentiates us to some extent from other independent owners.
In addition to independent owners, some ofthe major oil and gas producers own LNG carriers and, in the recent past

<<<

, they have contracted forthe constmction of new LNG carriers. Certain national oil and gas and shipping companies also have large fleets of LNG carriers that have expanded and may continue to expand. Some of these companies may compete with

<<<

 independent owners by using their fleets to carry LNG for third parties.
Seagoing and Shore-Based Employees
As of December 31,2017, we had 184 full-time employees and contractors based in our offices in Greece, Monaco, London, New York, Singapore

<<<

 and the newbuildings site in South Korea. In addition to our shore-based employees and contractors, we had approximately 1,435 seafaring staff serving on our owned and managed ships. These seafarers are retained through crewing agencies based

<<<

 in Ukraine, the Philippines and Spain or, in the case of Greek seafarers, through direct hire. As we take delivery ofournewbuildings, we expect to retain a significant number of additional seafarers qualified to staff and operate our new ships

<<<

, as well as a small number of additional shore-based personnel. We intend to focus our seafarer hiring efforts in the Ukraine, the Philippines and Spain, where we have crewing agency agreements in place, and in Greece.
LNG marine transportation

<<<

 is a specialized area requiring technically skilled officers and personnel with specialized training. Attracting and retaining motivated, well-qualified seagoing and shore-based personnel is a top priority, and we offer ourpeople competitive

<<<

 compensation packages and training and development opportunities. In addition, we provide intensive onboard training for our officers and crews to instill a culture focused on the highest operational and safety standards. As a result, we have

<<<

 historically enjoyed high retention rates. In 2017, our retention rate was 96% for senior seagoing officers, 97% for other seagoing officers and 98% for shore staff.
49

Table of Contents
Although we have historically experienced high employee

<<<

 retention rates, the demand for technically skilled officers and crews to serve on LNG carriers and FSRU vessels has been increasing as the global fleet of LNG vessels continues to grow. This increased demand has and may continue to put inflationary

<<<

 cost pressure on ensuring qualified and well-trained crew are available to GasLog. However, we expect that the impact of cost increases would be mitigated to some extent by certain provisions in our time charters, including automatic periodic

<<<

 adjustment provisions and cost review provisions.
Classification, Inspection and Maintenance
Every large, commercial seagoing ship must be "classed" by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the ship is "in class

<<<

", signifying that the ship has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable mles and regulations of the ship's country ofregistry and the international conventions of which

<<<

 that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting

<<<

 on behalf of the authorities concerned. The classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each

<<<

 individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.
To ensure each ship is maintained in accordance with classification society standards and for maintenance of the class certificate, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull

<<<

 and machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classes are required to be performed periodically. Surveys are based on a five-year cycle that consists of annual surveys, intermediate surveys that are typically completed

<<<

 between the second and third years of every five-year cycle, and comprehensive special surveys (also known as class renewal surveys) that are completed at each fifth anniversary of the ship's delivery.
All areas subject to surveys as defined

<<<

 by the classification society, are required to be surveyed at least once per five-year class cycle, unless shorter intervals between surveys are mandated. All ships are also required to be dry-docked at least once during every five-year class

<<<

 cycle for inspection of their underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a "recommendation" which must be rectified by the ship owner within prescribed time limits

<<<

. We intend to dry-dock our ships at five-year intervals that coincide with the completion of the ship's special survey.
Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a ship be certified as "in class" by a classification

<<<

 society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. All but two of our delivered ships are certified by the American Bureau of Shipping, or "ABS"; the other delivered ships are certified by the Det Norske

<<<

 Veritas. Each ship has been awarded International Safety Management ("ISM") certification and is currently "in class". Under our shipbuilding contracts, all of our contracted newbuildings must be certified prior to delivery to us.

Risk of Loss, Insurance and Risk Management

The operation of any ship has inherent risks. These

<<<

 risks include mechanical failure, personal injury, collision, property loss or damage, ship or cargo loss or damage and business intermption due to a number ofreasons, including mechanical failure, political circumstances in foreign countries

<<<

, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including explosion, spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating ships in international

<<<

 trade.

We maintain hull and machinery insurance on all our owned and bareboat ships against marine and war risks in amounts that we believe to be pmdent to cover such risks, as well as loss ofhire insurance against loss of income as a result

<<<

 of a ship being off-hire or otherwise suffering a loss of operational time for events falling under ourhull and machinery insurance. In addition, we maintain protection and indemnity insurance on all our owned and bareboat ships up to the maximum

<<<

 insurable limit available at any given time. We also maintain ship manager insurance in respect of our managed vessel. While we believe that our insurance coverage will be adequate, not all risks can be insured, and

51

Table of Contents

<<<


there can be no guarantee that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates or at all, or that any specific claim we may make under our insurance coverage will be paid.
Hull & Machinery Marine Risks Insurance

<<<

 and Hull & Machinery War Risks Insurance
We maintain hull and machinery marine risks insurance and hull and machinery war risks insurance on our owned and bareboat ships, which cover loss of or damage to a ship due to marine perils such as

<<<

 collisions, fire or lightning, and loss of or damage to a ship due to war perils such as acts of war, terrorism or piracy. Each of our ships is insured under these policies for a total amount that exceeds what we believe to be its fair market

<<<

 value. We also maintain hull disbursements and increased value insurance policies covering each of our owned ships, which provide additional coverage in the event of the total or constmctive loss of a ship. Our marine risks insurance policies

<<<

 contain deductible amounts for which we will be responsible, but there are no deductible amounts under our war risks policies or our total loss policies.
Loss ofHire Insurance/Delay Insurance
We maintain loss ofhire insurance to protect us

<<<

 against loss of income as a result of a ship being off-hire or otherwise suffering a loss of operational time for events falling under the temis of our hull and machinery insurance or hull and machinery/war risks insurance. Under our loss ofhire

<<<

 policy, our insurer will pay us the hire rate agreed in respect of each ship foreach day, in excess of a certain number of deductible days, forthe time that the ship is out of service as a result of damage, fora maximum of 180 days. The number

<<<

 of deductible days forthe ships in our fleet is 14 days per ship. In addition to the loss ofhire insurance, we also have in place delay insurance which, like loss ofhire, covers all of our owned and bareboat vessels for time lost due to events

<<<

 falling under the terms ofourhull and machinery insurance, plus additional protection and indemnity related incidents. The policy has a deductible oftwo days with a maximum of 12 days (which brings it in line with the loss ofhire deductible

<<<

 of 14 days) and a daily rate per vessel of $40,000 for our wholly owned and bareboat vessels orthe hire rate agreed as perthe loss ofhire insurance policy forthe Partnership's vessels.
Additionally, we buy piracy, loss ofhire and kidnap and

<<<

 ransom insurance when our ships are ordered to sail through the Indian Ocean to insure against potential losses relating to the hijacking of a ship and its crew by pirates.
Protection and Indemnity Insurance
Protection and indemnity insurance

<<<

 is typically provided by a protection and indemnity association, or "P&I association", and covers third-party liability, crew liability and other related expenses resulting front injury to or death of crew, passengers and other third parties

<<<

, loss of or damage to cargo, third-party claims arising front collisions with other ships (to the extent not recovered by the hull and machinery policies), damage to other third-party property, pollution arising front oil or other substances

<<<

 and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal.
Our protection and indemnity insurance covering our owned and bareboat ships is provided by P&I associations that are members ofthe International Group of Protection and

<<<

 Indemnity Clubs, or "International Group". The thirteen P&I associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world's commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association

<<<

's liabilities. Insurance provided by a P&I association is a form of mutual indemnity insurance.
52

Table of Contents
Ourprotection and indemnity insurance is currently subject to limits of $3 billion per ship/per event in respect of liability

<<<

 to passengers, crew and cargo interests and $1 billion per ship/per event in respect of liability for oil pollution.
As a member of a P&I association, we will be subject to calls payable to the P&I association based on the International Group

<<<

's claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the P&I association of which we are a member.
Safety Performance
We provide intensive onboard training for our officers and crews to instill a culture of the highest operational

<<<

 and safety standards. During 2017, GasLog's fleet experienced one restricted work case and five first aid cases.
Permits and Authorizations
We are required by various governmental and quasi-govemmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses

<<<

, financial assurances and certificates with respect to our ships. The kinds of pemiits, licenses, financial assurances and certificates required will depend upon several factors, including the waters in which the ship operates, the nationality

<<<

 of the ship's crew and the age ofthe ship. We have obtained all pemiits, licenses, financial assurances and certificates currently required to operate our ships. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which

<<<

 could limit our ability to do business or increase our cost of doing business.
Environmental and Other Regulation
The carriage, handling, storage and regasification of LNG are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the protection

<<<

 ofthe environment, health and safety and other matters. These laws and regulations include international conventions and national, state and local laws and regulations in the countries where our ships now or in the future will operate, or where

<<<

 our ships are registered. Compliance with these laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and may impact the resale value or useful lives of our ships. Our ships may be subject to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections by a variety

<<<

 of governmental, quasi-govemmental and private organizations, including the local port authorities, national authorities, harbor masters or equivalent, classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers

<<<

. Failure to maintain permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations required by some of these entities could require us to incur substantial costs or result in the temporary suspension ofthe operation of one or more of our ships or

<<<

 lead to the invalidation of our insurance coverage reduction.
We believe that our ships operate in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our ships in operation have all material permits, licenses, certificates

<<<

 or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. In fact, each of our ships have an ENVIRO, an ENVIRO+ora CLEAN notation front our classification societies, which denote compliance with their published guidelines concerning

<<<

 stringent criteria for environmental protection related to design characteristics, management and support systems, sea discharges and air emissions. Because environmental laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly

<<<

 stricter requirements, however, it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our ships. Moreover, additional legislation

<<<

 or regulation applicable to the operation of our ships that may be implemented in the future could negatively affect our profitability.

International Maritime Regulations
The IMO, the United Nations agency for maritime

<<<

 safety and the prevention of pollution by ships, has adopted several international conventions that regulate the international shipping industry, including the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ("SOLAS"), the International

<<<

 Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, the STCW (International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers

<<<

) and the MARPOL Convention. Ships that transport gas, including LNG carriers, are also subject to regulations under amendments to SOLAS, including the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention

<<<

, orthe "ISM Code". The ISM code requires, among otherthings, that the party with operational control ofa ship develop an extensive safety management system, including the adoption of a policy for safety and environmental protection setting

<<<

 forth instructions and procedures for operating its ships safely and also describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We rely on GasLog LNG Services for developing a safety management system for our ships that meets these requirements

<<<

. GasLog LNG also is subject to the International Code for Constmction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (orthe "IGC Code"), which prescribes design and construction standards for ships involved in the transport of gas

<<<

. Compliance with the IGC Code must be evidenced by a Certificate of Fitness forthe Carriage of Liquefied Gases of Bulk. Non-compliance with the IGC Code or other applicable IMO regulations may subject a ship owner ora bareboat charterer to

<<<

 increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected ships and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports.
SOLAS is an international maritime law which sets minimum safety standards

<<<

 in the constmction, equipment and operation of merchant ships. The convention requires signatory flag states to ensure that ships flagged by them comply with at least these standards. The current version of SOLAS is the 1974 version, known

<<<

 as SOLAS 1974, which came into force on May 25,1980. As of August 12, 2017, SOLAS 1974 had 163 contracting states, which flag about 99% of merchant ships around the world in terms of gross tonnage. SOLAS in its successive forms is generally

<<<

 regarded as the most important of all international maritime laws concerning the safety ofmerchant ships.
The International Convention on Standards ofTraining, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978 was adopted on July 7

<<<

, 1978 and entered into force on April 28, 1984. The main purpose ofthe Convention is to promote safety of life and property at sea and the protection of the marine environment by establishing in common agreement international standards oftraining

<<<

, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers. The Manila amendments to the STCW Convention and Code were adopted on June 25, 2010, marking a majorrevision ofthe STCW Convention and Code. The 2010 amendments entered into force on January 1

<<<

,2012 under the tacit acceptance procedure and were aimed at bringing the Convention and Code up to date with developments since they were initially adopted and to enable them to address issues that were anticipated to emerge in the foreseeable

<<<

 future.
The MARPOL Convention establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal ofnoxious liquids and the handling ofharmful substances in packaged form

<<<

. In September 1997, the IMO adopted Annex Vito MARPOL to address air pollution from ships. Annex VI came into force on May 19, 2005. It sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions

<<<

 of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions. Annex VI has

<<<

 been ratified by many, but not all, IMO member states. In October 2008, the Marine Environment Protection Committee, or "MEPC", ofthe IMO approved amendments to Annex VI regarding particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions

<<<

 standards. These amendments became effective in July 2010. These requirements establish a series ofprogressive
54

Table of Contents
standards to further limit the sulfur content in fuel oil, which are being phased in between 2012 and 202

<<<

0, and by establishing newtiers ofnitrogen oxide emission standards for new marine diesel engines, depending on their date of installation. Additionally, more stringent emission standards could apply in coastal areas designated as Emission Control

<<<

 Areas, or "ECAs". For example, "Tier III" emission standards apply in North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs to all marine diesel engines installed on a ship constmcted on or after January 1,2016. The European Union Directive 2005/EC/3

<<<

3, which became effective on January 1,2010, parallels Annex VI and requires ships to use reduced sulfur content fuel fortheirmain and auxiliary engines. Our owned ships currently in operation comply with the relevant legislation and have the

<<<

 relevant certificates including certificates evidencing compliance with Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention.
Although the United States is not a party, many countries have ratified the International Convention on Civil Liability forOil Pollution

<<<

 Damage, 1969, as amended, orthe "CLC". Underthis convention a ship's registered owner is strictly liable forpollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge ofpersistent oil, subject under certain circumstances

<<<

 to certain defenses and limitations. Ships carrying mote than 2,000 gross tons of oil, and trading to states that are parties to this convention, must maintain evidence of insurance in an amount covering the liability of the owner. In j urisdictions

<<<

 where the CLC has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law impose liability either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to the CLC. P&I Clubs in the International Group issue the required Bunker Convention (defined

<<<

 below) "Blue Cards" to provide evidence of insurance meeting the liability requirements. Where applicable, all of our vessels have received "Blue Cards" from their P&I Club and are in possession of a CLC State-issued certificate attesting that

<<<

 the required insurance coverage is in force.
The IMO also has adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, orthe "Bunker Convention", which imposes liability on ship owners forpollution damage in

<<<

 jurisdictional waters ofratifying states caused by discharges ofbunkerfuel and requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance forpollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable

<<<

 national or international limitation regime. We maintain insurance in respect of our owned ships that satisfies these requirements.
The Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 2006 was adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 94th (Maritime

<<<

) Session (2006), establishing minimum working and living conditions for seafarers. The convention entered into force August 20, 2013, whilst amendments were approved by the International Labour Conference at its 103rd Session (2014). The convention

<<<

 establishes a single, coherent instrument embodying all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour conventions and recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international Labour Conventions

<<<

.
United States
Oil Pollution Act and CPRCLA
Our operations are subject to the U.S. Pollution Act of 1990, or "OPA", which establishes an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills, and the

<<<

 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or "CERCLA", which imposes liability on owners and operators of ships for cleanup and natural resource damage from the release of hazardous substances (other than oil). Under

<<<

 OPA, ship owners, operators and bareboat charterers are responsible parties who are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely front the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all

<<<

 containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising front oil spills front their ships. OPA currently limits the liability of responsible parties with respect to ships over 3,000 gross tons to the greater of $2,200 per gross ton or $1

<<<

8,796,800 per double hull ship and pemiits individual states to impose their own liability
55

Table of Contents
regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Some states have enacted legislation providing

<<<

 for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for ships carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross

<<<

 ton or $0.5 million for any other ship.
These limits of liability do not apply under certain circumstances, however, such as where the incident is caused by violation of applicable U.S. Federal safety, constmction or operating regulations,

<<<

 or by the responsible party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, a marine incident that results in significant damage to the environment could result in amendments to these limitations or other regulatory changes in the future

<<<

. We maintain the maximum pollution liability coverage amount of $1 billion per incident for our owned ships. We also believe that we will be in substantial compliance with OPA, CERCLA and all applicable state regulations in the ports where

<<<

 our ships will call.
OPAalso requires owners and operators of ships to establish and maintain with the National Pollution Fund Center of the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential

<<<

 strict liability under the act. Such financial responsibility can be demonstrated by providing a guarantee front an appropriate guarantor, who can release the required guarantee to the National Pollution Fund Center against payment of the requested

<<<

 premium. We have purchased such a guarantee in orderto provide evidence offinancial responsibility and have received the mandatory certificates of financial responsibility front the U.S. Coast Guard in respect of all of our delivered ships

<<<

 and we intend to obtain such certificates in the future for each of our vessels, if they are required to have them.
Clean Water Act
The U.S. Clean Water Act of 1972, or "CWA", prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast

<<<

 water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal

<<<

, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. Furthermore, most U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal

<<<

 costs and damages resulting front a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be mote stringent than U.S. Federal law.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency, or "EPA", has enacted rules requiring ballast

<<<

 water discharges and other discharges incidental to the nomial operation of certain ships within United States waters to be authorized under the Ship General Pemiit for Discharges Incidental to the Nomial Operation o f Ships, or the "VGP".

<<<

 To be covered by the VGP, owners of certain ships must submit a Notice of Intent, or "NOI", at least 30 days before the ship operates in United States waters. Compliance with the VGP could require the installation of equipment on our ships

<<<

 to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other disposal arrangements, and/or otherwise restrict our ships front entering United States waters. In March 2013, the EPA published a VGP that includes numeric effluent

<<<

 limits for ballast water expressed as the maximum concentration of living organisms in ballast water. These VGP requirements also are the subject of litigation by certain environmental groups seeking mote stringent ballast water requirements

<<<

. In addition, the VGP also imposes a variety of changes for non-ballast water discharges including more stringent Best Management Practices for discharges ofoil-to-sea interfaces in an effort to reduce the toxicity of oil leaked into U.S. water

<<<

. We have submitted NOIs forall ofour delivered ships and intend to submit NOIs for our ships in the future, where required, and do not believe that the costs associated with obtaining and complying with the VGP will have a significant impact

<<<

 on our operations.
56

Table of Contents
Clean Air Act
The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990, or the "CAA", requires the EPAto promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic

<<<

 compounds and other air contaminants. Our ships may be subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas and emission

<<<

 standards for so-called "Category 3" marine diesel engines operating in U.S. waters. The marine diesel engine emission standards are currently limited to new engines beginning with the 2004 model year. On April 30, 2010, the EPA adopted final

<<<

 emission standards forCategory 3 marine diesel engines equivalent to those adopted in the amendments to Annex Vito MARPOL. However, our TFDE LNG carriers have the ability to burn natural gas as fuel to power the ship, which can significantly

<<<

 reduce relevant emissions compared with steam-powered ships.
The CAA also requires states to adopt State Implementation Plans, or "SIPs", designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in primarily major metropolitan and/or

<<<

 industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting front ship loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. The MEPC has designated as an ECA the area extending 200 miles front the territorial

<<<

 sea baseline adjacent to the Atlantic/Gulf and Pacific coasts and the eight main Hawaiian Islands and the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Caribbean Sea, under the Annex VI amendments. Fuel used by vessels operating in the ECA cannot exceed 0.10%

<<<

 sulfur. As of January 1,2016, NOx after-treatment requirements also apply. Our vessels can store and burn low-sulfur fuel oil or alternatively bum natural gas which contains no sulfur. Additionally, burning natural gas will ensure compliance

<<<

 with IMO Tier III NOx emission limitations without the need for after-treatment. Charterers must supply compliant fuel for the vessels before ordering vessels to trade in areas where restrictions apply. As a result, we do not expect such restrictions

<<<

 to have a materially adverse impact on our operations or costs.
Other Environmental Initiatives
U.S. Coast Guard regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act, or "NISA", impose mandatory ballast water management practices

<<<

 for all ships equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters, which could require the installation of equipment on our ships to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements

<<<

 or procedures, and/or otherwise restrict our ships front entering U.S. waters. In June 2012, the U.S. Coast Guard rule establishing standards for the allowable concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharged in U.S. waters and

<<<

 requiring the phase-in of Coast Guard approved ballast water management systems, or "BWMS", became effective. The mle requires installation ofCoast Guard approved BWMS (none of which have received full approval by the Coast Guard to date) by

<<<

 new vessels constmcted on or after December 1,2013 and existing vessels as of their first dry-docking after January 1,2016. Several states have adopted legislation and regulations relating to the permitting and management of ballast water discharges

<<<

.
At the international level, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments in February 2004, or the "BWM Convention". The BWM Convention's implementing regulations call fora

<<<

 phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits. The threshold ratification requirements forthe convention to enter into force were met earlier in 2016, and the

<<<

 convention became effective on September 8,2017. While we believe that the vessels in our fleet comply with existing requirements, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers. It is difficult to accurately predict the overall impact

<<<

 of such a requirement on our operations.
57

Table of Contents
Our vessels may also become subject to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances

<<<

 by Sea, 1996 as amended by the Protocol to the HNS Convention, adopted in April 2010, or "HNS Convention," if it is entered into force. The HNS Convention creates a regime of liability and compensation for damage front hazardous and noxious

<<<

 substances, or "HNS", including a two-tier system of compensation composed of compulsory insurance taken out by shipowners and HNS Fund which conies into play when the insurance is insufficient to satisfy a claim or does not cover the incident

<<<

. To date, the HNS Convention has not been ratified by a sufficient number of countries to enter into force.
Greenhouse Gas Regulations
The MEPC ofIMO adopted two new sets of mandatory requirements to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships

<<<

 at its July 2011 meeting. The Energy Efficiency Design Index requires a minimum energy efficiency level per capacity mile and is applicable to new vessels, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan is applicable to currently operating

<<<

 vessels. The requirements, which entered into force in January 2013, were fully implemented by GasLog as of December31,2012. The IMO is also considering the development o fa market-based mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions from ships, but

<<<

 it is impossible to predict the likelihood that such a standard might be adopted or its potential impact on our operations at this time.
The European Union has indicated that it intends to propose an expansion ofthe existing European Union

<<<

 emissions trading scheme to include emissions of greenhouse gases from marine ships. In the United States, the EPAhas issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety and has adopted regulations underthe CAA to limit

<<<

 greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and large stationary sources, although the mobile source emissions do not currently apply to greenhouse gas emissions from ships. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory

<<<

 initiatives by the IMO, the European Union, the United States or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted or amended at the international level that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant

<<<

 expenditures that we cannot predict with certainty at this time.
We believe that LNG carriers, which have the inherent ability to burn natural gas to power the ship, can be considered among the cleanest of large ships in terms of emissions

<<<

.
Ship Security Regulations
A number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years intended to enhance ship security. On November 25, 2002, the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, or "MTSA", was signed into law. To implement

<<<

 certain portions ofthe MTSA, the U.S. Coast Guard issued regulations in July 2003 requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard ships operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States. Similarly, in

<<<

 December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a new chapter ofthe convention dealing specifically with maritime security. This new chapter came into effect in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on ships and port authorities

<<<

, most of which are contained in the newly created International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code, or "ISPS Code". Among the various requirements are:

·

on-board installation of automatic information systems to enhance ship-to-ship and

<<<

 ship-to-shore communications;

·

on-board installation of ship security alert systems:

· the development o f ship security plans; and

·

compliance with flag state security certification requirements.

 owned vessels in operation, 11 ships contributed or sold to the Partnership (the Solaris is managed by a subsidiary of Shell), the bareboat vessel and one additional LNG carrier in which we have a 25.0% interest. We are also supervising the

<<<

 construction ofournewbuildings. We have secured multi-year time charter contracts for six of our operating ships, the 12 ships owned by the Partnership, the bareboat vessel and four of our five newbuildings on order, while five of our ships

<<<

 are operating in the spot market. As of December 31,2017, our contracts are expected to provide total contracted revenue of $3.1 billion during their initial temis, which expire between 2018 and 2029.
The additional LNG carrier in which we

<<<

 also have a 25.0% interest is thc Methane Nile Eagle, a 2007-built LNG carrier owned by Egypt LNG and technically managed by us. It is currently operating undera 20-year time charterto a subsidiary of Shell. The information about our owned

<<<

 fleet presented in this report does not include our ownership interest in the Methane Nile Eagle.
We generate revenues by chartering our ships to customers on multi-year time charters and short-term charters and by providing technical ship

<<<

 management services, including crewing, training, maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and HSSE management and reporting through our wholly owned subsidiary GasLog LNG Services. The Group's chief operating decision maker (the

<<<

 "CODM"), being the Chief Executive Officer, reviews the Group's operating results on a consolidated basis as one operating segment.
Industry Overview and Trends
Energy Prices
As referenced in "Item 3. Key Infomiation--Risk Factors", global

<<<

 cmde oil prices fell in 2014 and remained at relatively low levels through the third quarter of 2017. Combined with a significant increase in natural gas supply, this in turn applied downward pressure on international natural gas prices and

<<<

 led to a narrowing of the gap in natural gas pricing between different geographic regions.
As a result largely of strong increases in demand for oil and for natural gas, as well as the actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting

<<<

 Countries and Russia to reduce production of crude oil, global oil, gas and LNG prices have recovered in recent months. As of February 8, 2018, Brent crude oil was quoted at approximately $64.8 per barrel compared to approximately $55.1 per

<<<

 barrel at this time last year. International natural gas prices were quoted at approximately $5.1 per million British themial units ("niinbtu") forthe Title Transfer Index in North West Europe compared to $5.9 per niinbtu at the same time last

<<<

 year, and at approximately $8.2 permmbtu forthe Japan Korea Marker index in North Asia compared to $8.0 per mmbtu at the same time last year.
We believe that the difference between international gas prices and gas prices in the U.S., where

<<<

 Henry Hub gas pricing was quoted with a range of $2.4 - 3.7 permmbtu during 2017, is positive for LNG shipping given the economic incentive for natural gas buyers and marketers to ship LNG over longer distances, such as between sources of LNG

<<<

 in the U.S. and markets in Europe and Asia.
LNG Supply
The global seaborne trade of LNG cargoes was over 295 mtpa in 2017 and is projected by Wood Mackenzie to rise to approximately 320 mtpa in 2018. This forecasted growth is expected to be

<<<

 driven mainly by new Australian, U.S. and Russian LNG export projects, with shipments commencing or ramping up front Wheatstone Train 2 (4.5 mtpa), Ichthys Trains 1 and 2 (8.8 mtpa), Prelude (3.6 mtpa), Sabine Pass Train 4 (4.5 mtpa), Cove

<<<

 Point (5.3 mtpa) and Yantai (16.5 mtpa), all of which are scheduled to increase or start production over the next 12 months.
60

Table of Contents
Looking beyond 2018, there continues to be good visibility on the construction of new LNG production

<<<

 capacity through 2020 front projects in the U.S., Malaysia and Indonesia, with 42 nitpa expected to be added in 2019 and 36 nitpa expected to be added in 2020 according to Wood Mackenzie. Ofthese countries, the U.S. is by far the most significant

<<<

 contributor to new supply, with more than 40 nitpa of new LNG production capacity anticipated to enter production during 2019 and 2020. U.S. projects scheduled to begin exports by the end of2020 include Freeport (13.2 nitpa), Corpus Christi

<<<

 (9 nitpa), Cameron (12 nitpa), and Elba Island (2.5 nitpa). The majority of U.S. volumes have already been contracted with most expected to be sold into the Asian and European markets.
LNG Demand
As a result of economic growth, energy and environmental

<<<

 policy and declines in domestic production of natural gas in certain countries, demand for LNG increased strongly during 2017. China experienced especially strong growth with LNG imports increasing by 44% to approximately 38 nitpa in 2017.

<<<

 Other established markets where LNG demand grew strongly in 2017 include South Korea, Spain, Portugal and France. In addition, in recent years Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Poland, Lithuania, Colombia, Malta, Jamaica and Jordan all imported their

<<<

 first LNG cargoes.
This increase in the number of importing nations has been encouraged by low LNG prices, declining domestic production of gas in certain countries and attractive economics for FSRUs. These are either custom-built vessels or

<<<

 LNG carriers that have been converted to operate as FSRUs and offer cheaper and quicker access to LNG markets. FSRUs remain a growing sector of the LNG trade and they increase the number of potential LNG markets and trade routes. For example

<<<

, in 2017, Pakistan inaugurated its second FSRU temiinal with plans for at least two more. Several other countries are steadily progressing FSRU projects, including Greece, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Ivory Coast and Australia to name a few.
There

<<<

 are currently 26 FSRUs on the water, with a further 12 being delivered over the next two to three years. However, the availability of on-the-water FSRUs without charters and increasingly competitive tenders are putting FSRU charter rates underpressure

<<<

. In addition, newbuild FSRU costs are at historical lows, with a comparable all-in cost to a modern TFDE conversion. While this continues to be the case, FSRU conversions' competitive advantage is predominantly 'speed-to-market', targeting

<<<

 projects with start-ups prior to 2020.
Beyond 2020, signs are beginning to emerge oflonger term incremental demand for LNG. The Area 1 Project in Mozambique has entered into off-take contracts with PTT ofThailand and Tohoku Electric of Japan

<<<

 for2.6 nitpa and 0.3 nitpa, respectively. Gunvor, the energy trading company based in Switzerland, has contracted to acquire up to 2.2 nitpa from the Fortuna project in Equatorial Guinea. In the U.S., Edison of Italy and Shell have both contracted

<<<

 to acquire 1 nitpa overa 20-yearperiod from the Calcasieu Pass project. Trafigura has contracted to acquire 1 nitpa from Cheniere for 15 years commencing in 2019 and China National Petroleum Company ("CNPC") has contracted to acquire up to

<<<

 1.2 nitpa from Cheniere for up to 25 years commencing in 2018. These projects, as well as others in multiple regions ofthe world, continue to make progress towards taking FID. Should any further projects take FID, incremental LNG shipping capacity

<<<

 is likely to be required to transport the LNG produced by these projects. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that any ofthese projects will take FID or, if one ormore FIDs are taken, that incremental shipping will be contracted orthat we

<<<

 will be successful in securing renewed or new charters at attractive rates and durations to meet such LNG shipping requirements.
LNG Shipping Rates and Chartering Activity
As referenced in "Energy Prices" above, the significant fall in oil

<<<

 prices in 2014 combined with increases in LNG supply led to substantial declines in the price of LNG and a lack ofpricing
61

Table of Contents
differential between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. The resultant lack of inter basin trading

<<<

 led to a significant shortening of the average duration of spot charters fixed throughout 2015 and 2016 and into 2017. This decrease in ton mile demand together with the substantial increase in LNG shipping capacity as a result of deliveries

<<<

 of new LNG carriers since 2014, led to a significant decline in average rates for new prompt spot and shorter-term LNG charters.
The latter half of 2017 saw this trend reversing, with charterers taking vessels for longer periods and/or at higher

<<<

 rates. According to Clarksons, spot rates fora TFDE vessel in the Atlantic Basin increased to $85,000 per day in December 2017, an increase of approximately 90% over the same period in 2016. Spot charter temis also improved with round trip

<<<

 economics more coimnon in December 2017 and January 2018. In the Pacific Basin, reported rates were similar, attracting only a slight discount despite the greater availability of vessels in the region during the period.
The principal catalyst

<<<

 forthis increase in spot rates was strong LNG demand growth in Asia which led to greater ton-mile demand with many cargoes going front the U.S. to Asia, a voyage of approximately 9,000 nautical miles through the Panama Canal, a routing option

<<<

 now available to LNG shipping since the widening ofthe canal in 2016. However, there are limitations on the ability of LNG carriers to use the Panama Canal and the same voyage around Cape Horn is approximately 13,000 nautical miles. Front the

<<<

 U.S. GulfCoast to North West Europe, the distance is approximately 5,000 nautical miles. In recent years, the average global LNG voyage was in the range of 3,600 nautical miles to 4,000 nautical miles, and therefore any voyage in excess of

<<<

 this distance is likely to increase the global average voyage distance and thus the demand for LNG carriers.
According to Poten, approximately 335 charters of LNG vessels were fixed during 2017, compared with 273 in 2016. This significant increase

<<<

 in chartering activity is a positive sign forthe developing LNG shipping market and reflects among othertrends the increasing activity oftrading houses and LNG portfolio marketers.
Looking forward, it is likely that part ofthe recent increase

<<<

 in demand for LNG has been seasonal and driven in particular by colder weather in North Asia during the fourth quarter of 2017 and early 2018. It is therefore possible that there will be a reduction in LNG demand and LNG prices after the end

<<<

 of the Northern Hemisphere winter trading period. In addition, according to Wood Mackenzie, approximately 28 newbuild LNG carriers are due to be delivered during the first half of 2018 and a further 21 in the second half of 2018, representing

<<<

 an increase of 11.1% in the global LNG carrier fleet. In early February, Clarksons was quoting spot rates for TFDE vessels of $70,000-75,000 per day in the Atlantic Basin and $64,000-69,000 per day in the Pacific Basin. The combination of these

<<<

 factors may lead to a decrease in spot rates for LNG shipping which could hami our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders.
Over the longer term, if construction

<<<

 and commissioning ofthe new LNG production facilities referenced above in "LNG Supply"proceed as expected by Wood Mackenzie, the incremental supply ofLNG will increase the demand for LNG shipping capacity. Although much ofthe shipping required

<<<

 to transport this additional volume has been contracted and is currently under construction, encouraging levels of tendering activity are being noted and we continue to expect to see a likely future shortfall ofvessels required forthe LNG projects

<<<

 that have taken FID. A number offenders for newbuild LNG carriers were carried out during 2017 as charterers looked to lock in their longer-term LNG shipping requirements and to take advantage of current relatively low shipyard prices for newbuild

<<<

 vessels.
62

Table of Contents
Nonetheless, although there is broad market consensus that LNG ship demand is expected to outstrip ship supply overthe next few years, delays to start up, or unexpected downtime, of LNG supply projects may reduce

<<<

 demand for LNG shipping. Reduced demand for LNG or LNG shipping, or any reduction or limitation in LNG production capacity, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure future time charters at attractive rates and durations

<<<

 for new ships we may order or acquire, or upon expiration or early temiination of our current charter arrangements, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends

<<<

 to shareholders, as well as our ability to meet certain of our debt covenants. A sustained decline in charter rates could also adversely affect the market value of our ships, on which certain of the ratios and financial covenants with which

<<<

 we are required to comply are based.
Global LNG Fleet
As of December 31,2017, the global fleet of dedicated LNG carriers stood at 440 LNG Carriers (>100,000 cbm) on the water, and 93 LNG Carriers (>100,000 cbm) on order, of which 78 have long

<<<

-temi charters. In 2017, approximately 30 LNG carriers were delivered and only ten orders were placed. This low level of ordering is commensurate with the poor LNG shipping spot market conditions experienced between 2015 and the third quarter

<<<

 of 2017.
We believe that the growing global demand for natural gas, especially in Asia, increasing supply front the U.S. and other regions, and other LNG market trends, including increased trading of LNG leading to transportation inefficiencies

<<<

 with cargoes spending more time on the water, should support the existing order backlog for vessels and should also drive a need for additional LNG carrier newbuildings. In addition, LNG project developers are typically large multinational

<<<

 oil and gas companies that have high standards for safety and reliability and a preference for modem LNG carriers with fuel-efficient ship design and propulsion, which should support our ability to obtain new charters over new or less-experienced

<<<

 operators. Finally, the scrapping of older and less efficient vessels and/or the conversion of existing vessels to FSRUs could reduce the availability of LNG carriers. However, various factors, including changes in prices and demand for LNG

<<<

, can materially affect the competitive dynamics that currently exist and there can be no assurance that this need for additional carriers will materialize or that we will be successful in securing renewed or new charters at attractive rates

<<<

 and durations to meet such LNG shipping requirements.
The statements in this "Industry Overview and Trends" section are forward-looking statements based on management's current expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly

<<<

, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, perfonuance and outcomes to differ materially front those expressed herein. See "Item 3. Key Infomiation--D. Risk Factors" of this annual report.

A. Operating Results

Factors

<<<

 Affecting Our Results of Operations We believe the principal factors that will affect our future results of operations include:

· the number of LNG carriers in our owned and managed fleets:

· the timely delivery of our ships under construction

<<<

:

·

our ability to maintain good working relationships with our existing customers and our ability to increase the number of our customers

through the development of new working relationships:

· the perfonuance of our charterers:

· the

<<<

 supply-demand relationship for LNG shipping services: 63

Table of Contents

·

our ability to employ the ships we own and the bareboat vessel, including our LNG carriers on order, that currently do not have charters at

economically attractive

<<<

 rates;

· the effective and efficient technical management of the ships under our management;

·

our ability to obtain acceptable debt financing in respect of our capital commitments;

·

our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals

<<<

 and to satisfy technical, health, safety and compliance standards that meet our

customers'requirements; and

·

economic, regulatory, political and governmental conditions that affect shipping and the LNG industry, which include changes in

<<<

 the number

ofnew LNG importing countries and regions, as well as structural LNG market changes impacting LNG supply that may allow greater

flexibility and competition of other energy sources with global LNG use.

In addition to the general

<<<

 factors discussed above, we believe certain specific factors have impacted, or will impact, our results of operations. These factors include:

· the hire rate earned by our owned ships;

·

unscheduled off-hire days;

· the fees we receive

<<<

 for construction supervision and technical ship management services;

· the level of our ship operating expenses, including crewing costs, insurance and maintenance costs;

·

our access to capital required to acquire additional ships and/or

<<<

 to implement our business strategy;

·

our level of debt, the related interest expense and the timing ofrequired payments ofprincipal;

·

mark-to-market changes in interest rate swaps and foreign currency fluctuations; and

· the level of

<<<

 our general and administrative expenses, including salaries and costs of consultants.

Principal Components o f Revenues and Expenses
Revenues
Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of LNG carriers in our owned fleet, the amount of

<<<

 daily charter hire that they earn undertime charters and the number of operating days during which they generate revenues. These factors, in turn, are affected by our decisions relating to ship acquisitions and disposals, the amount of time

<<<

 that our ships spend in dry-dock undergoing repairs, maintenance and upgrade work, the age, condition and technical specifications of our ships as well as the relative levels of supply and demand in the LNG carrier charter market. Under the

<<<

 terms o f some of our time charter arrangements, the operating cost component ofthe daily hire rate is intended to correspond to the costs of operating the ship. Accordingly, we will receive additional revenue under certain of our time charters

<<<

 through an annual escalation ofthe operating cost component ofthe daily hire rate and, in the event of mote material increases in a ship's operating costs, we may be entitled to receive additional revenues underthose charters. Under some ofthe

<<<

 othertime charter arrangements, most of our operating costs are passed-through to the charterer in the fomi of an adjustment to the operating cost component ofthe daily hire rate. We believe these adjustment provisions provide substantial protection

<<<

 against significant cost increases. See "Item 4. Infomiation on the Company--B. Business Overview--Ship Time Charters--Hire Rate Provisions" for a mote detailed discussion ofthe hire rate provisions of our charter contracts.
Our LNG carriers

<<<

 are employed through time charter contracts. Revenues under our time charters are recognized when services are performed, revenue is earned and the collection ofthe revenue is
64

Table of Contents
reasonably assured. The charter hire revenue

<<<

 is recognized on a straight-line basis over the tem iofthe relevant time charter. We do not recognize revenue during days when the ship is off-hire, unless it is recoverable from insurers. Advance payments undertime charter contracts are classified

<<<

 as liabilities until such time as the criteria for recognizing the revenue are met.
The table below provides additional information about our contracted charter revenues based on contracts in effect as of December 31,2017 for (a) the six ships

<<<

 in our wholly owned fleet, the 12 ships in the GasLog Partners' fleet and the bareboat vessel for which we have secured time charters and (b) four of our five newbuildings on order. Other than the assumptions reflected in the footnotes to the

<<<

 table, including our assumption that ournewbuildings are delivered on schedule, the table does not reflect events, including charter party agreements signed or amended, occurring after December 31,2017. The table reflects only our contracted

<<<

 charter revenues for the ships in our owned fleet for which we have secured time charters, and it does not reflect the costs or expenses we will incur in fulfilling our obligations under the charters, nor does it include other revenues we may

<<<

 earn, such as revenues for technical management of customer-owned ships. In particular, the table does not reflect any revenues from the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Saratoga and the GasLog Salem that

<<<

 are operating in the Cool Pool, any additional ships we may acquire in the future, nor does it reflect the options under our time charters that permit our charterers to extend the time charter terms for successive multi-year periods. The entry

<<<

 into time charter contracts forthe GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Saratoga, the GasLog Salem and any additional ships we may acquire or the exercise of options extending the terms of our existing charters

<<<

, would result in an increase in the number of contracted days and the contracted revenue for our fleet in the future. The table reflects the upcoming substitution of the GasLog Salem forthe GasLog Skagen that will take place in the third quarter

<<<

 of 2018. Although the contracted charter revenues are based on contracted charter hire rate provisions, they reflect certain assumptions, including assumptions relating to future ship operating costs. We consider the assumptions to be reasonable

<<<

 as ofthe date ofthis report but, if these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual time charter revenues could differ from those reflected in the table. Furthermore, any contract is subject to various risks, including perfonuance by the

<<<

 counterparties oran early termination ofthe contract pursuant to its terms. Ifthe charterers are unable or unwilling to make charter payments to us, orifwe agree to renegotiate chartertemis at the request of a charterer or if contracts are

<<<

 prematurely terminated for any reason, we would be exposed to prevailing market conditions at the time and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Please see "Item 3. Key Infomiation--D. Risk

<<<

 Factors". For these reasons, the contracted charter revenue infomiation presented below is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this

<<<

 information. Neither the Company's independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the information presented in the table, nor have they expressed any opinion

The revenues ofGasLog LNG Services, our wholly owned subsidiary, are driven primarily by the number of ships operating under our technical

<<<

 management and the amount ofthe fees we earn foreach ofthese ships as well as the amount of fees that we may earn forplan approval and constmction supervision ofnewbuilding LNG carriers. In addition to revenues front external customers, GasLog

<<<

 LNG Services receives revenues fortechnical management, plan approval and constmction supervision services provided to our owned fleet, which are eliminated on consolidation.

Revenue front ship management and ship construction project supervision

<<<

 contracts is recognized in the statement ofprofit or loss when earned and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to us and such benefits can be measured reliably.

Vessel Operating and Supervision Costs

We are generally

<<<

 responsible for ship operating expenses, which include costs for crewing, insurance, repairs, modifications and maintenance, including dry-docking, lubricants, spare parts and consumable stores and other miscellaneous expenses, as well as the

<<<

 associated cost of providing these items and services. However, as described above, the hire rate provisions of our time charters are intended to reflect the operating costs borne by us. Our charters contain provisions that significantly reduce

<<<

 our exposure to increases in operating costs, including review provisions and cost pass-through provisions. Ship operating expenses are recognized as expenses when incurred.

In addition, we pay fees to GasLog LNG Services in connection with

<<<

 our own newbuildings on order forplan approval and construction supervision services provided by GasLog LNG Services and to cover third-party expenses incurred by GasLog LNG Services in respect ofthe newbuildings. These fees, other than any

<<<

 inter-segment profit, are capitalized as part ofthe asset value of our ships. The fees paid fortechnical ship management services, which are considered vessel operating and supervision

66

Table of Contents
costs of our owned fleet (and corresponding

<<<

 revenues of GasLog LNG Services), are eliminated on consolidation.
Vessel operating and supervision costs of GasLog LNG Services include staffcosts, such as salaries, social security and training forthe technical management team and project

<<<

 specialists, and project-related expenses.
Voyage Expenses and Commissions
Under our time charter arrangements, charterers bear substantially all voyage expenses, including bunker fuel, port charges and canal tolls, but not commissions, which

<<<

 we have historically paid to unaffiliated ship brokers based on a flat fee per ship. Commissions are recognized as expenses on a pro rata basis overthe duration ofthe period ofthe time charter.
Vessel operating costs and voyage expenses and

<<<

 commissions are expensed as incurred, with the exception of commissions, which are recognized on a pro-rata basis overthe duration ofthe period ofthe time charter. Bunkers consumption represents mainly bunkers consumed during vessels' unemployment

<<<

 and off-hire.
Furthemiore, in relation to the vessels participating in the Cool Pool, voyage expenses and commissions include the net allocation from the pool which represents GasLog's share ofthe net revenues earned front the otherpool participants

<<<

' vessels less the other participants' share ofthe net revenues earned by GasLog's vessels included in the pool. Each participant's share ofthe net pool revenues is based on the number of pool points attributable to its vessels and the number

<<<

 of days such vessels participated in the pool.
Depreciation
The majority of our consolidated depreciation expenses relate to the cost of our ships. We depreciate the cost of our ships on the basis of two components: a vessel component and a

<<<

 dry-docking component. The vessel component is depreciated on a straight-line basis overthe expected useful life of each ship, based on the cost ofthe ship less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful lives of our ships to be 

<<<

35 years front the date of delivery front the shipyard. Secondhand vessels are depreciated front the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life. Management estimates residual value of its vessels to be equal to the

<<<

 product of its lightweight tonnage ("LWT"), and an estimated scrap rate perLWT, which represents our estimate ofthe market value ofthe ship at the end of its useful life. We review scrap rates on an annual basis.
We must periodically dry-dock

<<<

 each ofour ships for inspection, repairs and maintenance and any modifications to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. All our ships are required to be dry-docked forthese inspections at least once every five years

<<<

. At the time of delivery of a ship, we estimate the dry-docking component ofthe cost ofthe ship, which represents the estimated cost ofthe ship's first dry-docking based on our historical experience with similar types of ships. The dry-docking

<<<

 component ofthe ship's cost is depreciated over five years, in case of new ships, and until the next dry-docking for secondhand ships, which is perforated within five years front the vessel's last dry-docking unless we determine to dry-dock

<<<

 the ships at an earlier date. In the event a ship is dry-docked at an earlier date, the unamortized dry-docking component is written off immediately.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist principally

<<<

 ofpersonnel costs for administrative and support staff, board of directors fees, expense recognized in connection with share-based compensation, rent, utilities, travel expenses, legal expenses, other professional services and consultants,

<<<

 training for crew familiarization and other advisor costs.

 the GasLog Gibraltar, which were delivered on March 29, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30,2016 and October 31,2016, respectively. These deliveries resulted in an increase in operating days. There was also an increase of $14.8 million in revenues

 from our vessels operating in the spot market and an increase of $1.1 million due to decreased off-hire days for scheduled dry-dockings in the year ended December 31,2017 compared to the same period in 2016. These increases were partially offset

 by a decrease of $24.7 million due to the expiration of two time charter party agreements during 2016 (with the vessels operating in the spot market thereafter) and a decrease of $0.8 million in revenues from the remaining vessels. The average

 on loans mainly due to the increased weighted average debt outstanding and the increased weighted average interest rate and an increase of $1.5 million in finance lease charges in 2017. The above increases were partially offset by (a) a decrease

 of $22.7 million in the amortization of deferred loan issuance costs and premium mainly driven by (i) a write-off of $18.2 million of unamortized loan fees associated with the six legacy facilities that were refinanced by the Legacy Facility

<<<

 additional collateral sufficient to bring us into compliance with such covenants, and if we fail to do so our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness.
Compliance with the financial covenants is required on a semi-annual basis and we were

<<<

<<<

 with these covenants and is not able to obtain covenant waivers or modifications, its lenders could require it to make prepayments or provide additional collateral sufficient to bring it into compliance with such covenants, and if it fails

<<<

 to do so its lenders could accelerate our indebtedness.
The GasLog Partners Credit Facility and the Five Vessel Refinancing also impose certain restrictions relating to the Partnership, including restrictions that limit its ability to make

<<<

 during any calendar year, 50% of the Group's consolidated net profit after taxes based on the audited annual accounts for the previous financial year (any unutilized portion of the permitted Distributions pursuant to the above may not be carried

<<<

 forward). For the purposes ofthe above, the consolidated net profit aftertaxes ofthe Group shall not include any profits related to the sale of assets (and consequently any such profits shall not form the basis for Distributions). Underthe

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
For infomiation about our exposure

<<<

 to market risks, see "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk".
Capital Expenditures
We make capital expenditures front time to time in connection with the expansion and operation of our owned fleet. In 2010 we took

<<<

 delivery oftwo LNG carriers, in 2013 we took delivery of six LNG carriers and acquired a secondhand vessel, in 2014 we took delivery oftwo LNG carriers and acquired six secondhand vessels, in 2015 we acquired two secondhand vessels and took

<<<

 delivery of one LNG carrier and in 2016 we took delivery of four LNG carriers. During the years ended December31,2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we funded $0.1 billion, $0.8 billion, $0.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of acquisition, construction

<<<

 and delivery costs, including installment payments on newbuildings, with funds borrowed under credit facilities and the bonds, capital contributions front ourpre-IPO shareholders, proceeds front our IPO and the GasLog Partners' IPO and proceeds

<<<

 front follow-on equity offerings and private placements.
As of December 31,2017, our commitments for capital expenditures related primarily to four contracted LNG carriers on order and the GasLog Houston delivered in January 2018 (and not including

<<<

 the contract price ofthe shipbuilding contract for Hull No. 2213 signed in 2018) were approximately $882.6 million. Amounts are payable under each shipbuilding contract in installments upon the attainment of certain specified milestones in

<<<

 each ship's constmction, with the largest portion ofthe purchase price for each ship coming due upon its delivery.
We intend to fund the majority of these commitments front borrowings under the October 2015 Facility which has an aggregate undrawn

<<<

 amount of $664.0 million, available cash and cash front operations.
83

Table of Contents
To the extent that we are unable to draw down the amounts committed under our credit facilities, we will need to find alternative financing. If we are

<<<

 unable to find alternative financing, we will not be capable of funding all of our commitments for capital expenditures relating to our contracted newbuildings and secondhand vessels, which could adversely impact our ability to pay dividends

<<<

 to our shareholders, and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in confomiity with IFRS requires us to make estimates and assumptions

<<<

 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements. GasLog's management evaluates whether estimates should be made on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical

<<<

 experience, consultation with experts and other methods management considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment

<<<

 to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities in the future. Critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions

<<<

 and conditions. Fora description of all our principal accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
Classification o f the Non-Controlling Interests
The non-controlling interests

<<<

 in the Partnership comprise the portion of the Partnership's common units that are not directly or indirectly held by GasLog (31,017,405 units as of December 31,2017). Under the temis of the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is required

<<<

 to distribute 100.0% of available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) with respect to each quarter within 45 days of the end ofthe quarterto the partners. Available cash can be summarized as cash and cash equivalents less an amount

<<<

 equal to cash reserves established by the Partnership's board of directors to (i) provide for the proper conduct ofthe business ofthe Partnership (including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs ofthe

<<<

 Partnership) subsequent to such quarter, (ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any Partnership group member is a party or by which it is

<<<

 bound or its assets are subject and/or (iii) provide funds for certain distributions relating to future periods.
In reaching a judgment as to whetherthe non-controlling interests in the Partnership should be classified as liabilities orequity

<<<

 interests, management has considered the wide discretion ofthe Partnership's board of directors to detemiine whether any portion ofthe amount of cash available to the Partnership constitutes available cash and that it is possible that there

<<<

 could be no available cash. In the event that there is no available cash, as detemiined by the Partnership's board of directors, the Partnership does not have a contractual obligation to make a distribution. Accordingly, management has concluded

<<<

 that the non-controlling interests do not represent a contractual obligation on the Partnership to deliver cash and therefore should be classified as equity within the financial statements.
Vessel Lives and Residual Value
Vessels are stated

<<<

 at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the vessel carrying amount relate to the estimation ofthe useful life of an LNG vessel of 35 years and the residual value. An increase

<<<

 in the estimated useful life of a vessel orin its residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and an increase in the estimated useful life o fa vessel would also extend the annual depreciation charge into

<<<

 later periods. A decrease in the useful life ofa vessel or its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge.
84

Table of Contents
Management estimated residual value of its vessels to be equal to the product

<<<

 of its LWT and an estimated scrap rate perLWT. Effective December 31, 2017, following management's annual reassessment, the estimated scrap rate per LWT was decreased. This change in estimate is expected to increase the future annual depreciation

<<<

 expense by $0.9 million. The estimated residual value of our ships may not represent the fair market value at any one time partly because market prices of scrap values tend to fluctuate. We might revise our estimate ofthe residual values ofour

<<<

 ships in the future in response to changing market conditions.
Ifregulations place significant limitations on the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, the vessel's useful life will be adjusted to end at the date such regulations

<<<

 become effective.
Impairment o f Vessels
We evaluate the carrying amounts of our vessels to detemiine whether there is any indication that our vessels have suffered an impairment loss by considering both internal and external sources of infomiation

. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount ofvessels is estimated in orderto detemiine the extent ofthe impairment loss, if any.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value

<<<

 in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments ofthe time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future

<<<

 cash flows have not been adjusted. The projection of cash flows related to vessels is complex and requires management to make various estimates including future charter rates, vessel operating expenses and the discount rate. All ofthese items

<<<

 have been historically volatile. In assessing the fair value less cost to sell ofthe vessel, we obtain vessel valuations front independent and internationally recognized ship brokers on a bi annual basis or when there is an indication that

<<<

 an asset or assets may be impaired. If an indication of impairment is identified, the need for recognizing an impairment loss is assessed by comparing the carrying amount ofthe vessels to the higher ofthe fair value less cost to sell and the

<<<

 value in use.
Our estimates of basic market value assume that the vessels are all in seaworthy condition without a need for repair and, if inspected, would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on approximate

<<<

 market values for the vessels that have been received front shipbrokers, which are also commonly used and accepted by our lenders for determining compliance with the relevant covenants in our credit facilities. Vessel values can be highly volatile

<<<

, so that the estimates may not be indicative ofthe current orfuture basic market value of our vessels orprices that could be achieved if we were to sell them.

of these

 vessels exceeds their aggregate basic charter-free market value by $356.4 million as o f December 31, 2017. However, as described below, the value in use for each o f the ten

vessels was higher than the carrying amount of these vessels and

Except where indicated, the market value of each vessel individually, and all vessels in the aggregate, exceeds the carrying value ofthat vessel, and all vessels in

<<<

 the aggregate, as of December 31,2016 and December 31,2017.

As of December 31,2017, for the ten vessels with carrying amounts higher than the estimated charter-free market value, we concluded that events and circumstances triggered the existence

<<<

 of potential impairment ofthese vessels. As a result, the Group performed the impairment assessment ofthe Group's vessels by comparing the discounted projected net operating cash flows for these vessels to their carrying value. The significant

<<<

 factors and assumptions the Group used in its discounted projected net operating cash flow analysis included, among others, operating revenues, otf-hire revenues, dry-docking costs, operating expenses, management fees and the discount rate

<<<

. Revenue assumptions were based on contracted time charter rates up to the end of life ofthe current contract of each vessel as well as the estimated average time charter rates forthe remaining life ofthe vessel afterthe completion of its current

<<<

 contract. The estimated daily time charter rates used for non-contracted revenue days are based on a combination of (i) recent charter market rates, (ii) conditions existing in the LNG market as of December 31,2017, (iii) historical average

<<<

 time charter rates based on publications by independent third party maritime research services and (iv) estimated future time charter rates based on publications by independent third party maritime research services that provide such forecasts

<<<

. Recognizing that the LNG industry is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond our control, management believes the use of revenue estimates, based on the combination of factors (i) to (iv) above, to be reasonable

<<<

 as ofthe reporting date. In addition, the Group used an annual operating expenses escalation factor and estimates of scheduled and unscheduled off-hire revenues based on historical experience. All estimates used and assumptions made were in

<<<

 accordance with the Group's internal budgets and historical experience ofthe shipping industry. The value in use forthe ten vessels calculated as per above was higher than the carrying amount ofthese vessels and, consequently, no impairment

<<<

 loss was recognized.

In connection with the impairment testing of our vessels as of December31,2017, forthe ten vessels with carrying amounts higher than the estimated charter-fiee market value, we perfomied a sensitivity analysis on the projected

<<<

 charter hire rate used to forecast future cash flows for non-contracted days which is the most sensitive and/or subjective assumption that has the potential to affect the outcome ofthe impairment exercise. The following table summarizes the

 average results ofthe sensitivity analysis that we perfomied.

Measurement ofShare-based Compensation

Share-based compensation to executives

<<<

 and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value ofthe equity instruments on the grant date. Details regarding the detemiination ofthe fair value of share-based transactions are set out in Note 21 ofthe consolidated financial

<<<

 statements included elsewhere in this annual report.

The fair value determined at the grant date ofthe equity-settled share-based compensation is expensed over the vesting period, based on our estimate of equity instruments that will eventually

<<<

 vest,

87

Table of Contents
with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, we revise our estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact ofthe revision ofthe original estimates, if

<<<

 any, is recognized in the consolidated statement ofproflt or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based compensation reserve.
Impairment o f Goodwill
We review goodwill

<<<

 forimpairment at least annually. Forthe purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the cash-generating unit representing our management company, GasLog LNG Services, which was acquired by us in 2005.
Determining whether goodwill

<<<

 has been impaired requires an estimation ofthe recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, ofthe cash-generating unit(s) to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires

<<<

 management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit(s) and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details ofthe assumptions used in the impairment analysis are set out in Note

<<<

 3 ofthe consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. No impairment loss was recognized for any ofthe periods presented.
Fair Value ofDerivative Financial Instruments
Our risk management policies permit the use

<<<

 of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in the

<<<

 consolidated statements of profit or loss.
A substantial majority of our derivative instruments activity relates to the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount that we would receive

<<<

 orpay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of both us and the swap counterparties. The estimated amount is the present value of estimated future cash

<<<

 flows, being equal to the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the fixed rate in the interest rate swap agreement, multiplied by the notional principal amount ofthe interest rate swap agreement at each interest reset date.
The

<<<

 fair value ofour interest rate and currency swap agreements at the end of each period are most significantly affected by the interest rate implied by market-observable data such as LIBOR yield curve, and forward foreign exchange rates. While

<<<

 the fair value ofour interest and currency swap agreements are typically more sensitive to changes in short-term rates, significant changes in the long-term benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates also materially impact our interest and

<<<

 currency swap agreements.
The fairvalue ofour interest and currency swap agreements are also affected by changes in our specific credit risk and counterparties'risk included in the discount factor. The estimate ofthe Group's credit risk is

<<<

 based on the credit rating of other companies in the LNG industry where publicly available, the rating ofthe global transportation industry where the shipping industry is included and the feedback that the Group receives from its lenders as

<<<

 part ofthe margin setting forthe new loan agreements. The counterparties' credit risk is estimated either by using the credit default swap rates obtained from public information or, if not available, by using the credit rating ofthe counterparties

<<<

.

Table of Contents
The LIBOR yield curve and our specific credit risk are expected to vary overthe life ofthe interest rate swap agreements. The largerthe notional amount ofthe interest rate swap agreements outstanding and the longerthe remaining

<<<

 duration ofthe interest rate swap agreements, the largerthe impact of any variability in these factors will be on the fair value of our interest rate swaps. We economically hedge the interest rate exposure on a significant amount of our long

<<<

-temi debt and for long durations. As such, we have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, material variations in the periodto-period fairvalue of our derivative instruments.
Although we measure the fairvalue of our

<<<

 derivative instruments utilizing the inputs and assumptions described above, if we were to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the derivative instruments may differ from our estimate

<<<

 of fair value. Ifthe estimated fairvalue differs from the actual termination amount, an adjustment to the carrying amount ofthe applicable derivative asset or liability would be recognized in profit or loss for the current period. Such adjustments

<<<

 could be material. See Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for the effects on the change in fairvalue of our derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of profit or loss.

's general management and control of its affairs and business and works with our board in developing our business strategy. The board of directors does not have a policy mandating that the roles of CEO and Chaimian be held by separate individuals

, but believes that the separation of such roles at this time is appropriate and beneficial to shareholders.
Dennis M. Houston, who serves as our senior independent director, acts as a liaison to facilitate communication between independent

 directors and our Chaimian to ensure that the board functions in an effective manner.

B. Compensation of Directors and Senior Management Our non-executive directors receive:

In addition, our directors receive reimbursement for their out-of-pocket expenses including travel costs. We do not have any service contracts with our directors that provide for benefits upon termination of their services.
For 2017, our executive

<<<

 officers were Paul Wogan, Simon Crowe (CFO to March 9,2017), Alastair Maxwell (CFO front March 9, 2017 onwards), Graham Westgarth (COO to May 2017) and Richard Sadler (COO front September 20, 2017 onwards). Compensation for our executive officers

<<<

 in 2017 consisted of base salary and employee benefits that are generally provided to employees, including eligibility to receive a cash incentive bonus pursuant to our Management Incentive Plan, or "MIP". The MIP provides all shore-based personnel

<<<

 (which includes our executive officers) an opportunity to earn a cash incentive payment based on a target percentage of the participant's annual base salary, subject to the achievement ofpre-established individual and Company perfonuance objectives

<<<

, as well as a factor based on Company discretion. Each participant's target percentage of annual base salary and the weightings assigned to the individual and Company performance objectives and the Company discretionary component are dependent

<<<

 on the participant's organization (band) level. No amounts will be paid underthe MIP to any participant who fails to achieve 50.0% ofhis orhertarget individual perfonuance objectives. In 2017, the Company perfonuance objectives were measured

<<<

 against three equally-weighted key business indicators ("KBI"): The Financial KBI is measured against a Free Cash Flow per Share target and an Absolute Return on Invested Capital target; the Operational KBI is defined by a basket of operational

<<<

 KBIs including Fleet Uptime, Vetting Perfonnance and Terminal Feedback targets; and three-year rolling average Relative Total Shareholder Return performance compared to a peer group. In addition, Company performance is evaluated against a safety

<<<

 factor based on Personal Safety, Significant Incidents and Leading Indicators, in which falling short ofthe safety target may result in a corresponding reduction ofthe Company perfonnance payout factor. Underthe individual and Company performance

<<<

 objectives, stretch goals are established, which, if met, can result in a payout of up to 120.0% ofthe individual's target payout. The Company discretionary component may not increase an individual's payment to mote than 200.0% ofhis orhertarget

<<<

 payout. The amounts paid to our executive officers in 2017 pursuant to the MIP were detemiined based on the following weightings: individual performance (30.0%), Company perfonnance (50.0%) and Company discretion (20.0%).
The aggregate amount

<<<

 of cash compensation, including cash incentive compensation, paid to our executive officers for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3.97 million.
In addition, our executive officers received equity-based compensation awards in accordance

<<<

 with the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, or the "Plan", and also received awards via the GasLog Partners LP 2015 Long-Temi Incentive Plan orthe "the GasLog Partners LTIP Plan". On April 3,2017, we granted our executive officers an

<<<

 aggregate of 139,823 stock options and 44,978 restricted stock units underthe Plan. Furthermore, on April 3,2017, we granted our executive officers an aggregate of 8,359 restricted stock units and 8,359 phantom perfonnance common units underthe

<<<

 GasLog Partners Plan. The aggregate fair value for all equity compensation granted as ofthe grant date is $1.4 million. The stock options have an exercise price per share of $15.55 and will vest in three equal annual installments, beginning

<<<

 on the first anniversary ofthe grant date, subject to the recipient's continued service. The restricted stock units vest on the third anniversary ofthe grant date, subject to the recipient's continued service. Vesting ofthe phantom performance

<<<

 common units is also subject to the achievement of certain perfonnance targets. The stock options, the restricted stock units and the phantom performance common units may be settled in cash or common shares, or a combination thereof, at our

<<<

 discretion.
We generally detemiine during the March meeting ofthe board ofthe directors each year which individuals, if any, will be eligible to receive equitybased compensation awards underthe Plan for such year and the amount of awards each

<<<

 participant will be eligible to receive. In addition, we intend to
95

Table of Contents
grant such awards on April 1 o f such year (or, should April 1 of such year fall on a weekend or bank holiday, on the first business day thereafter).

<<<

 may be filled by the shareholders or by the board of directors.
We are a "foreign private issuer" underthe securities laws of the United States and the rules ofthe NYSE. Underthe securities laws ofthe United States, "foreign private issuers

<<<

 consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement that the nominating committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities, (iii) the requirement that

<<<

 the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities and (iv) the requirement of an annual performance evaluation ofthe nominating and corporate

<<<

 governance and compensation committees. Five ofourten directors qualify as independent. We have one or more non-independent directors serving as committee members on our compensation committee and our corporate governance and nominating committee

<<<

. As a result, non-independent directors may, among otherthings, participate in fixing the compensation of our management, making share and option awards and resolving governance issues regarding our Company. Accordingly, in the future you may

<<<

 not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all ofthe NYSE corporate governance requirements.
Our board of directors meets regularly throughout the year. In 2017, the board met 13 times. As part of

<<<

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all directors

This document and other important information on our governance are posted on our website and may be viewed at http://www.gaslogltd.com. The information contained on or connected to our website

 Monaco S.A.M., Gildo Pastor Center, 7 Rue du Gabian, MC 98000, Monaco.

D. Employees
As of December 31,2017, we had 184 full-time employees and contractors based in our offices in Greece, Monaco, London, New York, Singapore and the newbuildings

<<<

 site in South Korea. In addition to our shore-based employees and contractors, we had approximately 1,435 seafaring staff serving on our owned and managed ships. These seafarers are retained through crewing agencies based in Ukraine, the Philippines

<<<

 and Spain or, in the case of Greek seafarers, through direct hire. As we take delivery ofournewbuildings, we expect to retain a significant number of additional seafarers qualified to staff and operate our new ships, as well as additional shore

<<<

-based personnel. We intend to focus our seafarer hiring efforts in the Ukrainian, Philippine and Spanish markets, where we have crewing agency agreements in place, and in Greece.
LNG marine transportation is a specialized area requiring technically

<<<

 skilled officers and personnel with specialized training. We regard attracting and retaining motivated, well-qualified seagoing and shore-based personnel as a top priority and we offer our people competitive compensation packages. In addition

<<<

, we provide intensive onboard training for our officers and crew to instill a culture of the highest operational and safety standards. As a result, we have historically enjoyed high retention rates. In 2017, our retention rate was 96% for senior

<<<

 seagoing officers, 97% for other officers and 98% for shore staff.
Although we have historically experienced high employee retention rates, the demand for technically skilled officers and crews to serve on LNG carriers and FSRU vessels has

<<<

 been increasing as the global fleet of LNG vessels continues to grow. This increased demand has, and may continue to, put inflationary cost pressure on ensuring qualified and well-trained crew are available to us. However, we expect that the

<<<

 impact of cost increases would be mitigated to some extent by certain provisions in our time charters, including automatic periodic adjustment provisions and cost review provisions.

 Party Transactions

Relationship with GasLog Partners
GasLog Partners was formed by us in January 2014 to own, operate and acquire LNG carriers engaged in LNG transportation under long-term charters, which we define as charters of five full

<<<

 years or more. In May 2014, the Partnership completed its initial public offering and its common units began trading on the NYSE. The Partnership conducts its operations through its vessel-owning subsidiaries and as of February 26,2018, had

<<<

 a fleet of 12 LNG carriers. As of February 26,2018, we hold a 25.9% interest in the Partnership and, as a result of our ownership of the general partner and the fact that the general partner elects the majority of the Partnership's directors

<<<

 in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, we have the ability to control the Partnership's affairs and policies.
Quarterly Cash Dividends
We are entitled to distributions on our general and limited partner interests in GasLog Partners.

<<<

 These interests consist of common units, incentive distribution rights and general partner interests.
The amount of the minimum quarterly distribution is $0,375 per unit or $1.50 per unit on an annualized basis.
We currently hold all of the

<<<

 incentive distribution rights in GasLog Partners. Incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash front operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution

<<<

 and the target distribution levels have been achieved.
If for any quarter:

·

GasLog Partners has distributed available cash front operating surplus to the common unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum

quarterly distribution: and


<<<


·

GasLog Partners has distributed available cash front operating surplus on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any

cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution:

then GasLog Partners will

<<<

 distribute any additional available cash front operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders and the general partner in the following manner:

·

first, 98.0% to all common unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to the general partner,

<<<

 until each unitholder receives a total of $0.43125 per unit for

that quarter:·

·

second, 85.0% to all common unitholders, pro rata, 2.0% to the general partner and 13.0% to the holders of the incentive distribution rights,

pro rata, until

<<<

 each unitholder receives a total of $0.46875 per unit for that quarter:

101

Table of Contents
· third, 75.0% to all common unitholders, pro rata, 2.0% to the general partner and 23.0% to the holders ofthe incentive distribution rights, pro

<<<

 rata, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.5625 per unit for that quarter; and
· thereafter, 50.0% to all common unitholders, pro rata, 2.0% to the general partner and 48.0% to the holders ofthe incentive distribution rights, pro rata

<<<

.
In each case, the amount ofthe target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any distributions to common unitholders to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment ofthe minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set

<<<

 forth above assume that the general partner maintains its 2.0% general partner interest and that the Partnership does not issue additional classes of equity securities.
As holder ofthe 2.0% general partner interest in GasLog Partners, we are

<<<

 entitled to 2.0% of all distributions made by GasLog Partners prior to its liquidation. The general partner, our wholly owned subsidiary, has the right, but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to GasLog Partners

<<<

 to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest if the Partnership issues additional units.
We received total distributions front GasLog Partners of $24.4 million in 2017.
Omnibus Agreement
On May 12, 2014, we entered into an omnibus agreement

<<<

 with GasLog Partners and certain ofits subsidiaries. The following discussion describes certain provisions ofthe omnibus agreement.
Noncompetition; Five-Year Vessel Restricted Business Opportunities
Under the omnibus agreement, we have agreed

<<<

, and have caused our controlled affiliates (other than GasLog Partners, its general partner and its subsidiaries) to agree, not to acquire, own, operate or charter any LNG carrier with a cargo capacity greater than 75,000 cbm engaged in oceangoing

<<<

 LNG transportation undera charter for five full years orniore without, within 30 days afterthe consummation ofthe acquisition orthe commencement ofthe operations or charter of such a vessel, notifying and offering GasLog Partners the opportunity

<<<

 to purchase such a vessel at fair market value. For purposes of this section, we refer to these vessels, together with any related charters, as "Five-Year Vessels" and to all other LNG carriers, together with any related charters, as "Non-Five

<<<

-Year Vessels". The restrictions in this paragraph will not prevent us or any of our controlled affiliates (other than GasLog Partners and its subsidiaries) front:
(1) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering Non-Five-Year Vessels:
(2) acquiring

<<<

 one orniore Five-Year Vessels if we promptly offer to sell the vessel to GasLog Partners for the acquisition price plus any administrative costs (including re-flagging and reasonable legal costs) associated with the transferto GasLog Partners

(4) acquiring one orniore Five-Year Vessels as part ofthe acquisition of a controlling interest in a business or package of assets and owning, operating or chartering

<<<

 those vessels; provided, however, that:
(a) if less than a majority ofthe value ofthe business orassets acquired is attributable to Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, we must offer to

Common Shares
Holders of our common shares have no pre-emptive, redemption, conversion or sinking fund rights. Holders of our common shares

<<<

 are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of holders of common shares. Unless a different majority is required by law or by our bye-laws, resolutions to be approved by holders of our common shares require approval

<<<

 by a simple majority of votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our common shares are entitled to share equally and ratably in our assets, if any, remaining

<<<

 afterthe payment of all of our debts and liabilities, subject to any liquidation preference on any issued and outstanding preference shares.
Preference Shares

<<<

 establish one or mote series of preference shares having such number of shares, designations, dividend rates, relative voting rights, conversion or exchange rights, redemption rights, liquidation rights and other relative participation, optional

<<<

 or other special rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions as may be fixed by the board without any further shareholder approval. Ofthe Company's 500 million authorised shares, 4.6 million have been designated 8.75% Series A Cumulative

<<<

 Redeemable Perpetual Preference Shares.
Dividend Rights
Under Bemiuda law, a company may not declare or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (i) the company is, or would afterthe payment be, unable to pay its liabilities

<<<

 as they become due: or (ii) the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under our bye laws, each common share is entitled to dividends if, as and when dividends are declared by our board of directors.
Any

<<<

 cash dividends payable to holders of our common shares listed on the NYSE will be paid to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent in the United States for disbursement to those holders.
Variation of Rights
If at any

<<<

 time we have more than one class of shares, the rights attaching to any class, unless otherwise provided for by the terms of issue of the relevant class, may be varied with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of the issued shares

<<<

 of such class. Our bye-laws specify that the creation or issue of shares ranking equally with existing shares will not, unless expressly provided by the terms of issue of existing shares, vary the rights attached to existing shares.
Transfer

<<<

 of Shares
Our board of directors may in its absolute discretion and without assigning any reason refuse to registerthe transfer of a share that is not fully paid. Our board of directors may also refuse to recognize an instrument of transfer

<<<

 of a share unless it is accompanied by the relevant share certificate and such other evidence of the transferor's right to make the transfer as our board of directors shall reasonably require. In addition, our board of directors may refuse

<<<

 to registerthe transfer of a share unless all applicable consents, authorizations and permissions of any governmental body or agency in Bermuda have been obtained. Subject to these restrictions, a holder of common shares may transfer the title

<<<

 to all or any ofhis common shares by completing a form of transfer in the form set out in our bye-laws (or as near thereto as circumstances admit) or in such other common form as the board may
113

Table of Contents

<<<

 of transfer must be signed by the transferor and transferee, although in the case of a fully paid share our board of directors may accept the instrument signed only by the transferor.
Meetings of Shareholders

<<<

 one general meeting of shareholders each calendar year. Bemiuda law provides that a special general meeting of shareholders may be called by the board of directors of a company and must be called upon the request of shareholders holding not

<<<

<<<

<<<

 arrangements pemiitting shareholders to participate in general meetings by such telephonic, electronic or other communications facilities or means as pemiit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously

<<<

<<<

 any other corporate records.

, and the size of our board of directors will be increased as needed to accommodate such change (unless the size of our board of directors already has been increased by reason ofthe election of a director by holders of parity securities upon

<<<

 which like voting rights have been conferred and with which the Preference Shares voted as a class for the election of such director). The right of such holders of Preference Shares to elect a member of our board of directors will continue

<<<

<<<

, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, except in cases where such liability arises from fraud or dishonesty ofwhich such director, officer or auditor may be guilty in relation to the company. Section 98 further provides that a Bemiuda

 company may indemnify its directors, officers and auditors against any liability incurred by them in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which j udgment is awarded in their favor or in which they are acquitted or granted

<<<

We have adopted provisions in our bye-laws that provide that we shall indemnify our officers and directors in respect of their actions and omissions, except

<<<

Amalgamations, Mergers and Business Combinations
The amalgamation or merger of a Bermuda company with another company or corporation (other than certain affiliated

<<<

 companies) requires the amalgamation or merger agreement to be approved by the company's board of directors and by its shareholders. Unless the company's bye-laws provide otherwise, the approval of 75.0% of the shareholders voting at such meeting

<<<

 is required to approve the amalgamation or merger agreement, and the quorum for such meeting must be two persons holding or representing more than one-third ofthe issued shares ofthe company. Our bye-laws provide that a merger or an amalgamation

<<<

 must only be approved by the affirmative votes of a majority ofthe votes attaching to all issued and outstanding shares entitling the shareholder to vote on such resolutions.

 Bermuda company with another company or corporation, a shareholder of the Bemiuda company who did not vote in favor ofthe amalgamation or merger and who is not satisfied that fair value has been offered for such shareholder's shares may, within

<<<

 one month ofnotice ofthe shareholders' meeting, apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda to appraise the fair value ofthose shares.
Shareholder Suits
Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under Bemiuda

<<<

 law. The Bermuda courts, however, would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power ofthe

<<<

 company orillegal, or would result in the violation ofthe company's memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be given by a Bemiuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders

<<<

 or, for instance, where an act requires the approval ofa greater percentage ofthe company's shareholders than that which actually approved it.
When the affairs ofa company are being conducted in a mannerthat is oppressive or prej udicial to

<<<

 the interests of some part ofthe shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to the Supreme Court of Bemiuda, which may make such order as it sees fit, including an order regulating the conduct ofthe company's affairs in the future or

<<<

 ordering the purchase ofthe shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or by the company.

<<<

 whether there has been a breach ofthe Companies Act or our bye-laws by an officer or director, any such dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction ofthe Supreme Court of Bemiuda. In addition, our bye-laws contain a provision by

<<<

 virtue of which our shareholders waive any claim or right of action that they have, both individually and on our behalf, against any director or officer in relation to any action or failure to take action by such director or officer, except

<<<

 in respect of any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer.

<<<

 shares) to the shareholders; or (ii) capitalize any sum standing to the credit o fa reserve account or sums otherwise available for dividend or distribution by paying up in full, partly paid or nil paid shares ofthose shareholders who would

<<<

Calls on Shares and Forfeiture
In the event of any issuance by the Company of shares that are not fully paid, our board of

<<<

 directors may make such calls as it thinks fit upon the holders of such partly paid shares in respect of any amounts unpaid on such shares (and not made payable at fixed times by the terms and conditions of issue). If a call on partly paid

<<<

 shares is not paid on or before the day appointed for payment thereof, the holder of such shares may at the discretion of our board of directors be liable to pay the Company interest on the amount of such call and our board of directors may

<<<

 direct the secretary of the Company to forward such shareholder a notice in writing demanding payment. Ifthe requirements of such notice are not complied with, any such share may at any time thereafter, until the payment of all amounts due

<<<

, be forfeited by a resolution of our board of directors to that effect, and such share shall thereupon become the property of the Company and may be disposed of as our board of directors shall detemiine.
Untraced Shareholders

<<<

 that our board of directors may forfeit any dividend or other monies payable in respect of any shares that remain unclaimed for six years from the date when such monies became due for payment. In addition, we are entitled to cease sending dividend

<<<

 warrants and checks by post or otherwise to a shareholder if such instruments have been returned undelivered to, or left uncashed by, such shareholder on at least two consecutive occasions or, following one such occasion, reasonable enquires

<<<

 have failed to establish the shareholder's new address. This entitlement ceases if the shareholder claims a dividend or cashes a dividend check or a warrant.
Certain Provisions of Bermuda Law
We have been designated by the Bemiuda Monetary

<<<

 Authority as a non-resident for Bemiuda exchange control purposes. This designation allows us to engage in transactions in currencies other than the Bemiuda dollar, and there are no exchange control restrictions on our ability to transfer funds

<<<

 (other than funds denominated in Bemiuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to U.S. residents who are holders of our common shares or our Preference Shares.
The Bermuda Monetary Authority has given its consent for the issue

<<<

 and free transferability of all our common shares to and between non-residents of Bemiuda for exchange control purposes, provided that our shares remain listed on an appointed stock exchange, which includes the NYSE. Approvals or permissions

<<<

 given by the Bemiuda Monetary Authority do not constitute a guarantee by the Bermuda Monetary Authority as to our performance or our creditworthiness. Accordingly, in giving such consent orpemiissions, the Bermuda Monetary Authority shall not

<<<

 be liable forthe financial soundness, perfonuance or default of our business or for the correctness of any opinions or statements expressed in this annual report. Certain issues and transfers of common shares involving persons deemed resident

<<<

 in Bermuda for exchange control purposes require the specific consent of the Bermuda Monetary Authority.
In accordance with Bemiuda law, share certificates are only issued in the names of companies, partnerships or individuals. In the case

<<<

 of a shareholder acting in a special capacity (for example as a trustee), certificates may, at the request of the shareholder, record the capacity in which the shareholder is acting. Notwithstanding such recording of any special capacity, we

<<<

 are not bound to investigate or see to the execution of any such trust. We will take no notice of any trust applicable to any of our shares, whether or not we have been notified of such trust.

 following discussion of U.S. Federal income tax matters is based on the Code, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the U.S. Department ofthe Treasury, all of which are subject to

 change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address any U.S. state or local taxes. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. Federal, state and local and foreign income and other

 tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our common shares or Preference Shares that may be applicable to you.
U.S. Taxation o f Our Operating Income
We have elected to treat a majority ofour subsidiaries as disregarded entities

<<<

 for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. The entities that are considered disregarded entities for U.S. Federal income tax purposes should be treated as branches rather than corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Currently, no election

 has been filed to treat GasLog LNG Services Ltd., GasLog Services UK Ltd., GasLog Asia Pte. Ltd., GasLog Investments Ltd., GasLog Monaco S.A.M., GasLog Shipping Limited, GasLog Shipping Company Ltd., and Egypt LNG Shipping Ltd. as disregarded

 entities for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. As a result, these entities and GasLog Services U.S. Inc. will continue to be treated as corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

U.S. Taxation o f Shipping Income

<<<


Subject to the discussion of "effectively connected" income below, unless we are exempt front U.S. Federal income tax under the rules contained in Section 883 ofthe Code, we will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax underthe rules of Section

<<<

 887 ofthe Code, which imposes on us a 4% U.S. income tax in respect of our U.S. source gross transportation income (without the allowance for deductions).
Forthis purpose, U.S. source gross transportation income includes 50% ofthe shipping

<<<

 income that is attributable to transportation that begins orends (but that does not both begin and end) in the United States. Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-U.S. ports is generally not subject to any

<<<

 U.S. income tax.
Forthis purpose, "shipping income" means income that is derived front:
(i) the use of ships:
(ii) the hiring or leasing of ships for use on a time, operating or bareboat charter basis:
(iii) the participation in a pool, partnership

<<<

, strategic alliance, joint operating agreement or otherjoint venture we directly or indirectly own or participate in that generates such income: or
(iv) the perfomiance of services directly related to those uses.
Under Section 883 ofthe Code

<<<

 and the regulations thereunder, we will be exempt front U.S. Federal income tax on our U.S. source gross transportation income if:
(i) we are organized in a foreign country (the "country of organization") that grants an "equivalent exemption

<<<

" to corporations organized in the United States: and
(ii) either
(a) more than 50% ofthe value of our shares is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are "residents" of our country of organization or of another foreign country that

<<<

 grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States (the "50% Ownership Test"), or
(b) our shares are "primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market" in our country of organization, in another

<<<

 country that grants an equivalent exemption to U.S. corporations, or in the United States (the "Publicly-Traded Test").
We are currently not entitled to this exemption under Section 883 for any tax year. As a result, we are subject to the 

<<<

4% U.S. Federal income tax under Section 887 on our U.S. source gross transportation income (subject to the discussion of "effectively connected income" below). For 2017, the U.S. source gross transportation tax was $0.7 million.
Because we

<<<

 are unable to qualify forthe exemption under Section 883, our U.S. source gross transportation income in future years that is considered to be "effectively connected" with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business is subject to the U.S. corporate

<<<

 income tax currently imposed at rate of up to 21% (net of applicable deductions). In addition, we may be subject to the 30% U.S. "branch profits" tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct o f such trade or business, as detemiined

<<<

 after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of our U.S. trade or business.
Our U.S. source gross transportation income would be considered effectively connected with the conduct

<<<

 of a U.S. trade or business only if:
(i) we had, or were considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning ofU.S. source gross transportation income: and
122

Table of Contents
(ii) substantially all

<<<

 ofourU.S. source gross transportation income was attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a ship that followed a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for

<<<

 voyages that begin or end in the United States.
We believe that we will not meet these conditions because we will not have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, such a fixed place of business in the United States or any ship

<<<

 sailing to or from the United States on a regularly scheduled basis.
In addition, income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the United States is not subject to the tax rules described above. Such income is subject to

<<<

 either a 30% gross-basis tax or to U.S. corporate income tax on net income at a rate of up to 21% (and the branch profits tax discussed above). Although there can be no assurance, we do not expect to engage in transportation that produces shipping

<<<

 income ofthis type.
Taxation o f Gain on Sale o f Shipping Assets
Regardless of whether we qualify for the exemption under Section 883 of the Code, we will not be subject to U.S. income taxation with respect to gain realized on a sale of a

<<<

 ship, provided the sale is considered to occur outside ofthe United States (as determined under U.S. tax principles). In general, a sale of a ship will be considered to occuroutside ofthe United States forthis purpose if title to the ship 

<<<

(and risk ofloss with respect to the ship) passes to the buyer outside ofthe United States. We expect that any sale of a ship will be so structured that it will be considered to occur outside ofthe United States.
Taxation o f United States Holders

<<<


You are a "U.S. holder" ifyou are a beneficial owner of our common shares or Preference Shares and you are a U.S. citizen orresident, a U.S. corporation (or other U.S. entity taxable as a corporation), an estate the income ofwhich is subject

<<<

 to U.S. Federal income taxation regardless of its source, ora trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration ofthe trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control

<<<

 all substantial decisions ofthe trust or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership holds our common shares or Preference Shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally

<<<

 depend upon the status ofthe partner and upon the activities ofthe partnership. Ifyou are a partner in a partnership holding our common shares or Preference Shares, you should consult your tax advisor.
Distributions on Our Common Shares and

<<<

 Preference Shares
Subject to the discussion of "passive foreign investment companies", or "PFICs", below, any distributions with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares that you receive from us generally will constitute dividends

<<<

 to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as detemiined under U.S. tax principles). Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be treated first as anontaxable return of capital to the extent of your tax

<<<

 basis in our common shares or Preference Shares (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) and thereafter as capital gain.
Because we are not a U.S. corporation, ifyou are a U.S. corporation (or a U.S. entity taxable as a corporation), you will not be

<<<

 entitled to claim a dividends-received deduction with respect to any distributions you receive from us.
123

Table of Contents
Dividends paid with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares will generally be treated as "passive category

<<<

 income" for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits forU.S. foreign tax credit purposes.
Ifyou are an individual, tmst orestate, dividends you receive front us should be treated as "qualified dividend income" taxed at a maximum

<<<

 preferential rate of 15% or 20%, depending on the income level of the individual, provided that:
(i) our common shares or Preference Shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE):
(ii

<<<

) we are not a PFIC for the tax year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding tax year (see the discussion below under"-- PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences"):
(iii) you own our common shares or Preference Shares

<<<

 for mote than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common shares or Preference Shares become ex-dividend:
(iv) you are not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially

<<<

 similar or related property: and
(v) certain other conditions are met.
Special mles may apply to any "extraordinary dividend". Generally, an extraordinary dividend is a dividend in an amount that is equal to (or in excess of) 10% of your adjusted

<<<

 tax basis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) in a share of our common shares (5% in the case of Preference Shares). If we pay an extraordinary dividend on our common shares or Preference Shares that is treated as "qualified dividend

<<<

 income" and ifyou are an individual, estate or tmst, then any loss derived by you from a subsequent sale or exchange of such common shares or Preference Shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.
There

<<<

 is no assurance that dividends you receive from us will be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Dividends you receive from us that are not eligible for the preferential tax rates will be taxed at

<<<

 ordinary income rates.
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition o f Common Shares and Preference Shares
Provided that we are not a PFIC for any tax year, you generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition

<<<

 of our common shares or Preference Shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by you from such sale, exchange or other disposition and your tax basis in such shares. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-temi

<<<

 capital gain or loss if your holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S. source income or loss, as applicable, forU.S. foreign tax

<<<

 credit purposes. Your ability to deduct capital losses against ordinary income is subject to limitations.
Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax
Each U.S. holder who is an individual, estate or tmst is generally subject to a 3.8% Medicare

<<<

 tax on the lesser of (i) such U.S. holder's "net investment income" for the relevant tax year, and (ii) the excess of such U.S. holder's modified adjusted gross income for the tax year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals

<<<

 will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual's circumstances). For this purpose, net investment income generally includes dividends on and capital gains from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares

<<<

 or Preference Shares, subject to certain exceptions. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicability of
124

Table of Contents
the Medicare tax to your income and gains front your ownership of our common shares

<<<

 or Preference Shares.
PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences
In General
Special U.S. income tax rules apply to you if you hold shares in a non-U.S. corporation that is classified as a PFIC forU.S. income tax purposes. In general, under

<<<

 Section 1297 of the Code, we will be treated as a PFIC in any tax year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, either:
(i) at least 75% of our gross income including our proportionate share of the gross income of our vessel-owning

<<<

 subsidiaries for such tax year consists ofpassive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived otherthan in the active conduct ofa rental business): or
(ii) at least 50% ofthe average value of our assets including our

<<<

 proportionate share ofthe assets of our vessel-owning subsidiaries during such tax year that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.
Income we earn, or are deemed to earn, in connection with the perfonuance of services will

<<<

 not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income will generally constitute passive income (unless we are treated under certain special mles as deriving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business).
There are legal

<<<

 uncertainties involved in detemiining whether the income derived front time chartering activities constitutes rental income or income derived front the perfonuance of services. In Tidewater Inc. v. United States, 565 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 200

<<<

9), the Fifth Circuit held that income derived front certain time chartering activities should be treated as rental income ratherthan services income forpurposes of a provision ofthe Code relating to foreign sales corporations. In recently published

<<<

 guidance, however, the IRS stated that it disagreed with the holding in Tidewater, and specified that time charters should be treated as service contracts. Since we have chartered all our ships to unrelated charterers on the basis of time charters

<<<

 and since we expect to continue to do so, we believe that we are not a PFIC. We have received an opinion front our counsel, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, that (i) the income we receive front time chartering activities and assets engaged in generating

<<<

 such income should not be treated as passive income or assets, respectively, and (ii) for the tax year during which our initial public offering occurred and each tax year thereafter, we should not be a PFIC. This opinion is based and its accuracy

<<<

 is conditioned on representations, valuations and projections provided by us regarding the nature of our assets, income and charters to our counsel. While we believe these representations, valuations and projections to be accurate, the shipping

<<<

 market is volatile and no assurance can be given that they will continue to be accurate. Moreover, we have not sought, and we do not expect to seek, an IRS ruling on this matter. As a result, the IRS or a court could disagree with ourposition

<<<

. No assurance can be given that this result will not occur. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a mannerto avoid, to the extent possible, being classified as a PFIC with respect to any tax year, we cannot assure you that

<<<

 the nature of our operations will not change in the future, or that we can avoid PFIC status in the future.
If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year, you generally would be subject to one of three different U.S. Federal income tax

<<<

 regimes, as discussed below, depending on whether or not you make certain elections. Additionally, for each year during which you own our common shares or Preference Shares, we are a PFIC and the total value of all PFIC stock that you directly

<<<

 or indirectly own exceeds certain thresholds, you will be required to file IRS Form 8621 with your U.S. Federal income tax return to report your ownership of our common shares or Preference Shares.

Taxation o f US. Holders

<<<

 Making a Timely QEFElection
If we were a PFIC and if you make a timely election to treat us as a "Qualifying Electing Fund" forU.S. tax purposes (a "QEF Election"), you would be required to report each yearyourpro rata share ofour ordinary

<<<

 earnings and ournet capital gain forourtax year that ends with orwithin your tax year, regardless of whether we make any distributions to you. Such income inclusions would not be eligible forthe preferential tax rates applicable to qualified

<<<

 dividend income (as discussed above under "Taxation of United States Holders--Distributions on Our Common Shares and Preference Shares"). Your adj usted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares would be increased to reflect such

<<<

 taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had previously been taxed would result in a corresponding reduction in your adj usted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares and would not

<<<

 be taxed again once distributed. You generally would recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition ofour common shares or Preference Shares. Even if you make a QEF Election for one of our tax years, if we were a

<<<

 PFIC fora prior tax year during which you held our common shares or Preference Shares and for which you did not make a timely QEF Election, you would also be subject to a mote adverse regime described below under "--Taxation ofU.S. Holders

<<<

 That Make No Election".
You would make a QEF Election by completing and filing IRS Form 8621 with your U.S. income tax return for the year for which the election is made in accordance with the relevant instmctions. If we were to become aware

<<<

 that we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year, we would notify all U.S. holders of such treatment and would provide all necessary information to any U.S. holder who requests such infomiation in order to make the QEF Election described

<<<

 above with respect to us.
Taxation o f U.S. Holders Making a Timely "Mark-to-Market"Election
Alternatively, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year and, as we believe, our common shares or Preference Shares are treated as "marketable

<<<

 stock", you would be allowed to make a "mark-to-market" election with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares, provided you complete and file IRS Fomi 8621 with your U.S. income tax return forthe year for which the election is made

<<<

 in accordance with the relevant instmctions. If that election is made, you generally would include as ordinary income in each tax year the excess, if any, ofthe fair market value ofour common shares or Preference Shares at the end ofthe tax

<<<

 year over your adjusted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares. You also would be pemiitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of your adjusted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares overits fair market

<<<

 value at the end ofthe tax year (but only to the extent ofthe net amount previously included in income as a result ofthe mark-to-market election). Your tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares would be adjusted to reflect any such

<<<

 income or loss amount. Gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition ofour common shares or Preference Shares would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition ofthe common shares

<<<

 or Preference Shares would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included by you.
Taxation o f U.S. Holders That Make No Election
Finally, if we were treated as a PFIC

<<<

 for any tax year and if you did not make either a QEF Election or a mark-to-market election for that year, you would be subject to special rules with respect to (i) any excess distribution (that is, the portion of any distributions received

<<<

 by you on our common shares or Preference Shares in a tax year in excess of 125% ofthe average annual distributions received by you in the three preceding tax years, or, if shorter, your holding period for our common shares or
126

Preference Shares) and (ii) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares. Under these special rules:
(i) the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over your

<<<

 aggregate holding period for our common shares or Preference Shares:
(ii) the amount allocated to the current tax year would be taxed as ordinary income: and
(iii) the amount allocated to each of the othertax years would be subject to tax at

 the highest rate oftax in effect forthe applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge forthe deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such othertax year.

 and Preference Shares
You generally will not be subject to U.S. income or withholding taxes on a distribution received from us with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares, unless the income arising from such distribution is effectively

<<<

 connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If you are entitled to the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty with respect to that income, that income generally is taxable in the United States only if it is

 attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States.
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition o f Our Common Shares and Preference Shares
You generally will not be subject to U.S. income tax or withholding tax on any

<<<

 gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares, unless:
(i) the gain is effectively connected with your conduct ofa trade orbusiness in the United States. Ifyou are entitled to the benefits

<<<

 of an applicable income tax treaty with respect to that gain, that gain generally is taxable in the United States only if it is attributable to a pemianent establishment maintained by you in the United States: or
(ii) you are an individual

<<<

 who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the tax year of disposition and certain other conditions are met.
Gain that is effectively connected with the conduct ofa trade orbusiness in the United States (or so treated)

<<<

 generally will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax (net of certain deductions) at regular U.S. Federal income tax rates. Ifyou are a corporate non-U.S. holder, your earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income

<<<

 (subject to certain adjustments) may be subject to an additional U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable tax treaty).
United States Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In General

<<<


In general, ifyou are a non-corporate U.S. holder, dividend payments (or other taxable distributions) made within the United States will be subject to information reporting requirements and backup withholding tax ifyou:
(i) fail to provide

<<<

 an accurate taxpayer identification number:
127

Table of Contents
(ii) are notified by the IRS that you have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on yourU.S. Federal income tax returns; or
(iii) in certain circumstances

<<<

, fail to comply with applicable certification requirements.
If you are a non-U.S. holder, you may be required to establish your exemption from infomiation reporting and backup withholding by certifying your status on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN

<<<

-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as applicable.
If you sell our common shares or Preference Shares to or through a U.S. office or broker, the payment of the sales proceeds is subject to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting unless you

<<<

 certify that you are a non-U.S. person, under penalties ofpetjury, oryou otherwise establish an exemption. If you sell our common shares or Preference Shares through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to

<<<

 you outside the United States, then infomiation reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment.
However, U.S. infomiation reporting requirements (but not backup withholding) will apply to a payment of sales proceeds

<<<

, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell our common shares or Preference Shares through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or has certain other connections with the United States.
Backup withholding

<<<

 tax is not an additional tax. Rather, you generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by accurately completing and timely filing a refund claim with the IRS.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board ofDirectors ofGasLog Ltd.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control

<<<

 over financial reporting ofGasLog Ltd and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

 Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013)

<<<

 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards ofthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,2017, ofthe Company

<<<

 and our report dated February 28,2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its

<<<

 assessment ofthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's

<<<

 internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the

<<<

 applicable rules and regulations ofthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards ofthe PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perfomi the audit to obtain reasonable assurance

<<<

 about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness

<<<

 exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a

<<<

 reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations o f Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability

<<<

 of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control overfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures

<<<

 that (1) pertain to the maintenance ofrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions ofthe assets ofthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
131

Table of Contents

<<<


recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management

<<<

 and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

<<<

.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become

<<<

 inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Differences Between Our Corporate Governance Practices and the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Standards for U.S. Non-Controlled Issuers
Overview
Pursuant to certain exceptions for foreign private issuers, we are not required to

<<<

 comply with certain ofthe corporate governance practices followed by U.S. companies underthe NYSE listing standards. However, pursuant to Section 303.A.11 ofthe NYSE Listed Company Manual and the requirements of Fomi 20-F, we are required to

<<<

 state any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ front the practices required by the NYSE for U.S. companies. We believe that our established practices in the area of corporate governance are in line with the spirit

<<<

 ofthe NYSE standards and provide adequate protection to our shareholders. The significant differences between our corporate governance practices and the NYSE standards applicable to listed U.S. companies are set forth below.
Independence o

<<<

 fDirectors
The NYSE mles do not require a listed company that is a foreign private issuer to have a board of directors that is comprised of a majority of independent directors. Under Bermuda law, we are not required to have a board of directors

<<<

 comprised of a majority of directors meeting the independence standards described in the NYSE mles. Accordingly, our board of directors is not required to be and is not comprised of a majority of independent directors. However, our board of

<<<

 directors has determined that half of our directors, specifically David P. Conner, William M. Friedrich, Dennis M. Houston, Donald J. Kintzerand Anthony S. Papadimitriou satisfy the independence standards established by the NYSE as applicable

<<<

 to us.
Corporate Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee
Pursuant to NYSE Rules 303A.04 and 303A.05, the NYSE requires that a listed U.S. company have a nominating/corporate governance committee and a compensation committee, each

<<<

 composed entirely of independent directors. As pemiitted under Bemiuda law, we have one or more
134

Table of Contents
non-independent directors serving as committee members on our compensation committee and our corporate governance and nominating

<<<

 committee.
NYSE Rules 303A.02 and 303A.05 contain independence requirements for compensation committee directors and compensation committee advisers for U.S. listed companies, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection

<<<

 Act of 2010. Bemiuda law does not have similar requirements therefore we may not adhere to these new requirements.

 compliance

The consolidated financial statements of GasLog and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (the "IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the

"IASB").

Basis o fpreparation and approval

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of

The financial statements are expressed in U.S

. dollars ("USD"), which is the functional currency of the Group's subsidiaries because their vessels operate in international shipping markets in which revenues and expenses are primarily settled in USD, and the Group's most significant assets

 and liabilities are paid for and settled in USD.
On February 26, 2018, the financial statements were authorized on behalf of GasLog's board of directors forissuance and filing.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Basis o f

<<<

 consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of GasLog and entities controlled by GasLog (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where GasLog:

· has power over the investee:

·

is exposed, or has

<<<

 rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and

· has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated

<<<

 financial statements from the date control is obtained and up to the date control ceases. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated

<<<

 in full on consolidation.
The other investors in subsidiaries in which the Group has less than 100% interest hold anon-controlling interest in the net assets of these subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest is stated at the non-controlling interest

<<<

's proportion of the net assets ofthe subsidiaries where the Group has less than 100% interest. Subsequent to initial recognition the carrying amount of non-controlling interest is increased or decreased by the non-controlling interest's share

<<<

 of subsequent changes in the equity of such subsidiaries. Total comprehensive income is attributed to a non-controlling interest even if this results in the non controlling interest having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group's ownership

<<<

 interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect

<<<

 the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and

<<<

 attributed to owners of the Group.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognized as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill

<<<

 is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of

<<<

 the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the Group's interest in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred

<<<

, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss

<<<

 as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies

<<<

 ofthe combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Ifthe recoverable amount of the cash-generating

<<<

 unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets ofthe unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset

<<<

 in the unit. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination ofthe profit or loss on disposal.
Investment in

<<<

 associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neithera subsidiary noran interest in ajoint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions

<<<

 ofthe investee but is not control orjoint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are included in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified

<<<

 as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. An impairment assessment ofinvestments in associates is performed when there is an indication that the asset has

<<<

 been impaired orthe impairment losses recognized in prior years no longer exist.
When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount ofthe investment, the investment is reported at nil value and recognition of losses is discontinued

<<<

 except to the extent ofthe Group's commitment.
Investment injoint ventures
Ajoint arrangement is an arrangement where two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is established by a contractual arrangement that requires unanimous

<<<

 agreement on decisions made on relevant activities. Without the presence ofjoint control, joint arrangements do not exist.

Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint

<<<

 arrangements are classified as eitherjoint operations orjoint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, ratherthan the legal structure of the joint arrangement. The arrangement is a joint

<<<

 operation when the contractual agreement provides rights to assets and obligations for liabilities for those parties sharing joint control. The joint arrangement is ajoint venture when the agreement grants rights to the arrangement's net assets

. The Cool Pool is a joint venture. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see Investment in associates above), after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Leases

<<<


Lease income from operating leases of vessels where the Group is a lessor is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on

<<<

 their nature under "Tangible fixed assets".
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the

<<<

 lease's inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease, if practicable, or else at the Group's incremental borrowing rate

<<<

. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in current and non-current liabilities as finance lease liabilities. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged

<<<

 to profit or loss overthe lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated overthe asset

<<<

's useful life or overthe shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease temi if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards

<<<

 of ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis overthe

<<<

 period of the lease.
Deferral and presentation ofgovernment grants
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in the profit or loss overthe period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate

<<<

. Government grants relating to income are included in non-current liabilities as deferred income and are credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis as costs are incurred overthe duration ofthe specific project.
Accounting for revenues

<<<

 and related operating expenses
The Group's revenues comprise revenues from time charters forthe charter hire ofits vessels, gross pool revenues, management fees, project supervision income and other income earned during the period in accordance

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Revenue from vessel management and vessel constmction project supervision contracts is recognized when earned and when it is probable that future economic benefits

<<<

 will flow to the Group and such a benefit can be measured reliably.
Pool revenues are recognized on a gross basis representing time charter revenues earned by GasLog vessels participating in the pool under charter agreements where GasLog contracts

<<<

 directly with charterers. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis, when the vessel is made available and services are provided to the charterer during the period, the amount can be estimated reliably and collection of the related revenue is

<<<

 reasonably assured.
A time charter represents a contract entered into for the use of a vessel fora specific period of time and a specified daily charter hire rate. Time charter revenue is recognized as earned on a straight-line basis overthe

<<<

 term ofthe relevant time charter starting from the vessel's delivery to the charterer, except for the off-hire period, when a charter agreement exists, the vessel is made available and services are provided to the charterer and collection ofthe

<<<

 related revenue is reasonably assured. Unearned revenue includes cash received prior to the balance sheet date relating to services to be rendered after the balance sheet date. Accmed revenue represents income recognized in advance as a result

<<<

 ofthe straight-line revenue recognition in respect of charter agreements that provide for varying charter rates.
Time charter hires received in advance are classified as liabilities until the criteria for recognizing the revenue as earned are

<<<

 met.
Under a time charter arrangement the vessel operating expenses such as management fees, crew wages, provisions and stores, technical maintenance and insurance expenses and broker's commissions are paid by the vessel owner, whereas voyage

<<<

 expenses such as bunkers, port expenses, agents' fees, and extra war risk insurance are paid by the charterer.
Accounting for voyage expenses and commissions
Vessel operating costs and voyage expenses and commissions are expensed as incurred

<<<

, with the exception of commissions, which are recognized on a pro-rata basis overthe duration ofthe period ofthe time charter. Bunkers' consumption represents mainly bunkers consumed during vessels unemployment and off-hire.

 expense, other borrowing costs and realized loss on interest rate swaps are recognized on an accrual basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the USD are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of

 consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Deferredfinancing costsfor undrawnfacilities
Commitment, arrangement, structuring, legal and agency fees incurred for obtaining new loans or refinancing existing facilities

Deferred financing costs are deferred and amortized to financial costs overthe term of the relevant loan, using the effective interest method. When the relevant loan is terminated or extinguished, the unamortized loan

<<<

 fees are written-off in the consolidated statement ofprofit or loss.
Vessels under construction
Vessels under construction are presented at cost less identified impairment losses, if any. Costs include shipyard installment payments and other

<<<

 vessel costs incurred during the construction period that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the vessels.
Upon completion ofthe construction, the vessels are presented on the statement of financial position in accordance

<<<

 with the "Tangible fixed assets: Property, plant and equipment" policy as described below.
Tangiblefixed assets: Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment

<<<

 loss. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition. The cost of an LNG vessel is split into two components, a "vessel component" and a "dry-docking

<<<

 component". Depreciation for the vessel component is calculated on a straight-line basis, after taking into account the estimated residual values, overthe estimated useful life ofthis major component ofthe vessels. Residual values are based

<<<

 on management's estimation about the amount that the Group would currently obtain from disposal ofits vessels, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the vessels were already ofthe age and in the condition expected at the end of

 their useful life.
The LNG vessels are required to undergo dry-docking overhaul every five years to restore their service potential and to meet their classification requirements that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating. The

the shipyard or acquisition from the previous owner and is measured based on the estimated cost of the

<<<

 first dry-docking subsequent to its acquisition, based on the Group's historical experience with similar types of vessels. For subsequent dry-dockings actual costs are capitalized when incurred. The dry-docking component is depreciated over

<<<

 the period of five years in case ofnew vessels, and until the next dry-docking for secondhand vessels (which is perfomied within five years from the vessels' last dry-docking).

Costs that will be capitalized as part of the future dry-dockings

<<<

 will include a variety of costs incurred directly attributable to the dry-dock and costs incurred to meet classification and regulatory requirements, as well as expenses related to the dock preparation and port expenses at the dry-dock shipyard

<<<

, dry-docking shipyard expenses, expenses related to hull, external surfaces and decks, and expenses related to machinery and engines ofthe vessel, as well as expenses related to the testing and correction of findings related to safety equipment

<<<

 on board. Dry-docking costs do not include vessel operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, lubricants consumption, insurance, management fees or management costs during the dry-docking period. Expenses related

<<<

 to regular maintenance and repairs of vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and repair occurs during the same time period as dry-docking.

The expected useful lives of all long-lived assets are as follows:

Vessel
LNG vessel

35 years 5 years 3 -5 years 12 years (or remaining temi ofthe lease)

Management estimates the useful life of its vessels to be

<<<

 35 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard. Secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life.

The useful lives of all assets and the depreciation method are

<<<

 reviewed annually to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items ofproperty, plant and equipment. The residual value is also reviewed at each financial period-end

<<<

. If expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for prospectively in profit or loss in the period ofthe change and future periods.

Ordinary maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life ofthe asset are

<<<

 expensed as incurred.

When assets are sold, they are derecognized and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is included in profit or loss.

exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and "value in use".

<<<

 The fair value less cost of disposal is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction less the costs of disposal, while "value in use" is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from

<<<

 the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if it is not possible, for the cash generating unit. Each vessel is considered to be a separate

<<<

 cash-generating unit. The fair values of the vessels are estimated from market-based evidence by appraisal that is normally undertaken by professionally qualified brokers.

Provisions

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present

<<<

 obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision

<<<

 is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end ofthe reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash

<<<

 flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or all ofthe economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable

<<<

 is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount ofthe receivable can be measured reliably.

Inventories

Inventories represent lubricants on board the vessel and, in the event of a vessel

<<<

's unemployment, the bunkers on board the vessel. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost calculated on a first in, first out basis, and net realizable value.

Financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the

<<<

 Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions ofthe instrument. All financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial

<<<

 liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value ofthe financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.

Trade receivables

Trade receivables are carried at the amount expected to be received from the third party to settle the obligation. Bad debts are written off during the period in which they are identified. An

Borrowings

Borrowings are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds

Derivative financial instruments

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments

<<<

 to economically hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps ("CCSs") and forward foreign exchange contracts.

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized

 at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement ofprofit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and

<<<

 effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing ofthe recognition in the consolidated statement ofprofit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. Derivatives are presented as assets when their valuation is favorable

<<<

 to the Group and as liabilities when unfavorable to the Group.

The Group's criteria for classifying a derivative instrument in a hedging relationship include: (1) the hedging instrument is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting

<<<

 changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk: (2) the effectiveness ofthe hedge can be reliably measured: (3) there is adequate documentation ofthe hedging relationships at the inception ofthe hedge: and (4) for cash

 hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group temiinates the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, temiinated or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

Any gain or loss

Finance lease liabilities

Finance lease liabilities are initially

 subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Finance charges in respect of finance leases are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under "Financial costs".

Segment Information

The

 infomiation provided to the Group's chief operating decision maker (the "CODM"), being the Chief Executive Officer, to review the Group's operating results and allocate resources is on a consolidated basis for a single reportable segment. Furthermore

, when the Group charters a vessel to a charterer, the charterer is free to trade the vessel worldwide and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic information is impracticable.

Share-based compensation

Share-based compensation to employees

 and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments on the grant date. Details regarding the detemiination ofthe fair value of share-based transactions are set out in Note 21.

The fair value detemiined

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Critical accounting judgments and key sources

<<<

 of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized

<<<

 in the consolidated financial statements. The Group's management evaluates whether estimates should be made on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods management considers reasonable in

<<<

 the particular circumstances. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities in the future. Critical accounting

<<<

 judgments are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.
Critical accounting judgments:
In the process of applying GasLog's accounting

<<<

 policies, management has made the following judgments, apart from those involving estimations, that had the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
Classification o f the non-controlling interests

<<<

: The non-controlling interests in the Partnership comprise the portion of the Partnership's common units that are not directly or indirectly held by GasLog (31,017,405 units as of December 31,2017). Under the temis of the partnership agreement

<<<

, the Partnership is required to distribute 100% of available cash (as defined in the partnership agreement) with respect to each quarter within 45 days ofthe end of the quarter to the partners. Available cash can be summarized as cash and cash

<<<

 equivalents less an amount equal to cash reserves established by the Partnership's board of directors to (i) provide for the proper conduct of the business of the Partnership (including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated

<<<

 future credit needs of the Partnership) subsequent to such quarter, (ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any Partnership member is a party

<<<

 or by which it is bound or its assets are subject and/or (iii) provide funds for certain distributions relating to future periods.
In reaching a judgment as to whetherthe non-controlling interests in the Partnership should be classified as

<<<

 liabilities orequity interests, management has considered the wide discretion ofthe board of directors ofthe Partnership to determine whether any portion ofthe amount of cash available to the Partnership constitutes available cash and that

<<<

 it is possible that there could be no available cash. In the event that there is no available cash, as detennined by the Partnership's board of directors, the Partnership does not have a contractual obligation to make a distribution. Accordingly

<<<

, management has concluded that the non-controlling interests do not represent a contractual obligation on the Partnership to deliver cash and therefore should be classified as equity within the financial statements.

2. Significant

<<<

 Accounting Policies (Continued)
Key sources o f estimation uncertainty are as follows:
Vessel lives and residual value: Vessels are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant

<<<

 effect on the vessel carrying amount relate to the estimation ofthe useful life of an LNG vessel of 35 years and the residual value. An increase in the estimated useful life o fa vessel orin its residual value would have the effect of decreasing

<<<

 the annual depreciation charge and an increase in the estimated useful life of a vessel would also extend the annual depreciation charge into later periods. A decrease in the useful life ofa vessel or its residual value would have the effect

<<<

 of increasing the annual depreciation charge.
Management estimated residual value ofits vessels to be equal to the product ofits lightweight tonnage ("LWT") and an estimated scrap rate perLWT. Effective December 31,2017, following management

<<<

's annual reassessment, the estimated scrap rate per LWT was decreased. This change in estimate is expected to increase the future annual depreciation by $873. The estimated residual value ofthe ships may not represent the fair market value

<<<

 at any time partly because market prices of scrap values tend to fluctuate. Management might revise its estimate ofthe residual values ofthe ships in the future in response to changing market conditions.
Ifregulations place significant limitations

<<<

 on the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, the vessel's useful life will be adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective.
Impairment o f vessels: The Group evaluates the carrying amounts of its vessels to detemiine

<<<

 whether there is any indication that those vessels have suffered an impairment loss by considering both internal and external sources of infomiation. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount ofvessels is estimated in order to determine

<<<

 the extent ofthe impairment loss, if any.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount

<<<

 rate that reflects current market assessments ofthe time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. The projection of cash flows related to vessels is complex and

<<<

 requires management to make various estimates including future charter rates, vessel operating expenses and the discount rate. All ofthese items have been historically volatile, fn assessing the fairvalue less cost to sell ofthe vessel, the

<<<

 Group obtains vessel valuations from independent and internationally recognized ship brokers on a semi-annual basis or when there is an indication that an asset or assets may be impaired. If an indication of impairment is identified, the need

<<<

 for recognizing an impairment loss is assessed by comparing the carrying amount ofthe vessel to the higher ofthe fairvalue less cost to sell and the value in use.
The Group's estimates ofrecoverable value assume that the vessels are all in

<<<

 seaworthy condition without need forrepairand certified in class without notations of any kind. The Group's estimates are based on approximate charter free market values for its vessels that have been received from shipbrokers, which are also

<<<

 commonly used and accepted by the Group's lenders for detemiining compliance with the relevant covenants in its credit facilities. Vessel values can be highly volatile, so the estimates may not be indicative ofthe current orfuture market value

<<<

 ofthe Group's vessels orprices that could be achieved if it were to sell them.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
As of December 31,2017, the carrying amounts of each often vessels were higher than the charter free

<<<

 market values estimated by shipbrokers and the Group concluded that events and circumstances triggered the existence ofpotential impairment of these vessels. As a result, the Group performed the impairment assessment ofthese vessels by comparing

<<<

 the discounted projected net operating cash flows forthese vessels to their carrying values. The assumptions which the Group has used in its discounted projected net operating cash flow analysis included, among others, operating revenues, utilization

<<<

, dry-docking costs, operating expenses (including management fees), residual values and the discount factor.
Forthose vessels operating under long-term time charters, revenue assumptions were based on contracted time charter rates up to the

<<<

 end oflife ofthe current contract of each vessel, as well as the estimated average time charter rates forthe remaining life ofthe vessel afierthe completion of its current contract. The revenue assumptions exclude days of scheduled off-hire

<<<

 and assume a utilization rate of 99.5% based on the fleet's historical perfonuance and internal forecasts. The estimated daily time charter rates used for non-contracted revenue days after the completion of the current time charter are based

<<<

 on a combination of (i) recent charter market rates, (ii) conditions existing in the LNG market as of December 31,2017, (iii) historical average time charter rates, based on publications by independent third party maritime research services

<<<

 ("maritime research publications"), and (iv) estimated future time charter rates, also based on maritime research publications that provide such forecasts. More specifically, forthe non-contracted period starting upon the expiration ofthe firm

<<<

 charter period of each vessel and up to December 31,2022, the Group used the most recent charter market rates fora 5-year time charter agreement based on available data from maritime research publications which is $52 per day for steam-powered

<<<

 ("Steam") vessels and $67.5 per day for tri-fuel diesel electric ("TFDE") vessels. Forthe remaining period from January 1,2023 through the end of each vessel's useful life, the estimated average time charter rates for Steam and TFDE vessels

<<<

 were based on analysis of future supply and demand for LNG, analysis of future LNG shipping supply and demand balances, internally estimated and market-derived costs of building and financing newbuild LNG vessels, the technical characteristics

<<<

 of each vessel and 5-year historical average 5-year time charter rates based on maritime research publications.
For vessels operating in the spot market and employed through the Cool Pool, the estimated charter rates and utilization forthe

<<<

 first year from the reporting date were based on the latest available maritime research publications from ship brokers for short-term (less than 12 months) employment of a vessel operating in the spot market on less than 1-year time charter

<<<

 contracts (in line with the Cool Pool strategy). The estimated charter rates are also based on existing charter contracts and forecasts generated by the Cool Pool directly, which reflect conditions existing in the LNG current spot market. For

<<<

 the remaining period and through the end of each vessel's useful life, the Group assumes that all vessels are operating under multi-year time charters, as a result of which the revenue assumptions were the same as the forecasted rates used

<<<

 forthe remaining vessels ofthe fleet as discussed above. Recognizing that the LNG industry is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond the Group's control, management believes the use ofrevenue estimates discussed

 above to be reasonable as ofthe reporting date. The Group does not take into account any growth rate assumptions or inflation factors for detemiining forecasted time charter rates beyond the contracted charter rate period through the end of

 a vessel's useful life. In assessing the factors mentioned above

In addition, the Group used an annual operating expenses escalation factor equal to 1% based on its historical data and performance, as well as expectations

<<<

 of future inflation and operating and dry-docking costs. Estimates forthe remaining useful lives ofthe current fleet and residual and scrap values are the same as those used forthe Group's depreciation policy.
In the Group's impairment assessment

<<<

, the weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") used to discount future estimated cash flows to theirpresent values was approximately 8% as of December 31,2017. This was based on the calculated cost of equity and cost of debt components. All

<<<

 estimates used and assumptions made were in accordance with the Group's internal budgets and historical experience ofthe shipping industry.
The value in use forthe ten vessels calculated as per above was higher than the carrying amount of these

<<<

 vessels and, consequently, no impairment loss was recognized.
Measurement o fshare-based compensation: Share-based compensation to executives and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value ofthe equity instruments on the

<<<

 grant date. Details regarding the detemiination ofthe fair value of share-based transactions are set out in Note 21.
The fair value detemiined at the grant date ofthe equity-settled share-based compensation is expensed over the vesting period

<<<

, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate ofthe number of equity instruments expected to vest

<<<

. The impact ofthe revision ofthe original estimates, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based compensation

<<<

 reserve.
Impairment ofgoodwill: The Group reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually. Forthe purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the cash-generating unit representing the management company, GasLog LNG Services

<<<

 Ltd., which was acquired by the Group in 2005.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation ofthe recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, ofthe cash-generating units to which

<<<

 goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit(s) and a suitable discount rate in orderto calculate present value. Details ofthe

<<<

 assumptions used in our impairment analysis are set out in Note 3. No impairment loss was recognized for any ofthe periods presented.
Fair value o f derivativefinancial instruments: The Group's risk management policies permit the use of derivative

<<<

 financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in the consolidated statement

<<<

 of profit or loss.

, except share and per share data)
2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
A substantial majority ofthe Group's derivative instruments activity relates to the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value ofthe Group's interest rate swap

<<<

 agreements is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to temiinate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of both the Group and the swap counterparties

<<<

. The estimated amount is the present value of estimated future cash flows, being equal to the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the fixed rate in the interest rate swap agreement, multiplied by the notional principal amount

<<<

 ofthe interest rate swap agreement at each interest reset date.
The fair value ofthe Group's interest and currency swap agreements at the end of each period are most significantly affected by the interest rate implied by market-observable data

<<<

 such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") yield curve and forward foreign exchange rates. While the fair value ofthe Group's interest and currency swap agreements are typically more sensitive to changes in short-term rates, significant

<<<

 changes in the long-temi benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates also materially impact interest and currency swap agreements.
The fair value ofthe Group's interest rate and currency swap agreements are also affected by changes in its

<<<

 specific credit risk and counterparties' risk included in the discount factor. The estimate ofthe Group's credit risk is based on the credit rating of other companies in the LNG industry where publicly available, the rating ofthe global transportation

<<<

 industry where the shipping industry is included and the feedback that the Group receives from its lenders as part ofthe margin setting forthe new loan agreements. The counterparties' credit risk is estimated either by using the credit default

<<<

 swap rates obtained from public information or, if not available, by using the credit rating ofthe counterparties.
The LIBOR yield curve and the Group's specific credit risk are expected to vary overthe life ofthe interest rate swap agreements

<<<

. The largerthe notional amount ofthe interest rate swap agreements outstanding and the longerthe remaining duration ofthe interest rate swap agreements, the largerthe impact of any variability in these factors will be on the fair value ofthe

<<<

 Group's interest rate swaps. The Group economically hedges the interest rate exposure on a significant amount of its long-term debt and for long durations. As such, the Group has historically experienced, and expects to continue to experience

<<<

, material variations in the period-to-period fair value of its derivative instruments.
Although the Group measures the fair value ofits derivative instruments utilizing the inputs and assumptions described above, ifit were to temiinate the

<<<

 agreements at the reporting date, the amount the Group would pay or receive to temiinate the derivative instruments may differ from the estimate of fair value. Ifthe estimated fair value differs from the actual termination amount, an adjustment

<<<

 to the carrying amount ofthe applicable derivative asset or liability would be recognized in profit or loss forthe current period. Such adjustments could be material. See Note 25 forthe effects on the change in fair value ofits derivative instruments

<<<

 on the consolidated statements of profit or loss.
Adoption o fnew and revised IFRS
(a) Standards and interpretations adopted in the current period
In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 7 Statement o f Cash Flows introducing an

<<<

 additional disclosure that will enable users offinancial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
arising from financing activities. The amendments are part of the IASB's Disclosure

<<<

 Initiative, which continues to explore how financial statement disclosure can be improved. Entities will be required to disclose changes arising from cash flows, such as drawdowns and repayments of borrowings and also non-cash changes, such

<<<

 as acquisitions, disposals and unrealised exchange differences. Even though a specific fomiat is not mandated, where a reconciliation is used, the disclosure should provide sufficient infomiation to link items included in the reconciliation

<<<

 to the statement of financial position and statement of cash flows. The amendments, which were effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,2017, had a disclosure impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements; please

<<<

 referto Note 26.
(b) Standards and amendments in issue not yet adopted
At the date of authorization of these financial statements, the following standards and amendments relevant to the Group were in issue but not yet effective:
In May 201

<<<

4, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which applies to all contracts with customers: the main exceptions are leases, financial instruments and insurance contracts. IFRS 15 specifies how and when an IFRS reporter will

<<<

 recognize revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users offinancial statements with more infomiative, relevant disclosures. The standard supersedes IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and a number of revenue-related

<<<

 interpretations. The standard was amended in September 2015 to delay the effective date to annual periods beginning on or after January 1,2018 but early adoption is permitted. In addition, the standard was further amended in April 2016 to clarity

<<<

 the guidance on identifying perfonuance obligations, accounting for licenses of intellectual property and the principal versus agent assessment (gross versus net revenue presentation), as well as to give new and amended illustrative examples

<<<

 and practical expedients. The Group will adopt the standard as of January 1,2018 and is expecting that the adoption will not have a material effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements, otherthan additional disclosure requirements

<<<

 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, since the Group has chartered its vessels undertime charter agreements and a bareboat agreement, and in this respect, revenue is accounted for under the leases standard.
In July 2014, the

<<<

 IASB issued the complete version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard requires all financial assets to be subsequently measured

<<<

 at amortized cost or fair value depending on the business model ofthe legal entity in relation to the management ofthe financial assets and the contractual cash flows ofthe financial assets. The standard also requires a financial liability

<<<

 to be classified as either at fair value through profit or loss or at amortized cost. In addition, a new hedge accounting model was introduced, that is designed to be mote closely aligned with how entities undertake risk management activities

<<<

 when hedging financial and non-financial risk exposures. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1,2018 but early adoption is permitted. The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting on its cross-currency

<<<

 swaps in relation to its NOK denominated bonds (Note 25) (but does not apply hedge accounting on its cash flow interest rate swaps in relation to its floating debt) and management anticipates that the new mles under IFRS 9 on hedge accounting

<<<

 are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

<<<

31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 (All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)
2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, which sets out the principles forthe

<<<

 recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure ofleases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer ("lessee") and the supplier ("lessor"). IFRS 16 eliminates the classification ofleases by lessees as either operating leases or

<<<

 finance leases and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Applying that model, a lessee is required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a temi of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of

<<<

 low value: and (b) depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the statement of profit or loss. Lessors continue to classify their leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account forthose two types

<<<

 ofleases differently. IFRS 16 supersedes the previous leases Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations. The standard is effective from January 1,2019, with early adoption pennitted only with concurrent adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue

<<<

 from Contracts with Customers. Management anticipates that the implementation ofthis standard will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements, since the changes for lessors are fairly minor.
The impact of all

<<<

 other IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet adopted is not expected to be material on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
3. Goodwill
Goodwill resulted from the acquisition in 2005 of Ceres LNG Services Ltd., the vessel

<<<

 management company, which represents a cash-generating unit. On September 30, 2011, Ceres LNG Services Ltd. was renamed "GasLog LNG Services Ltd." As of December 31,2017, the Group assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill, and concluded

<<<

 that goodwill associated with the Group's vessel management company was not impaired. The recoverable amount ofthe vessel management operations is detemiined based on a value-in-use calculation which uses cash flow to be generated based on

<<<

 financial budget forthe year ending December 31,2018, approved by management.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations (2018 and beyond) are as follows:
(i) Average inflation of 1.0% per annum:
(ii) A pre-tax discount rate

<<<

 of 12.2% per annum:
(iii) Annual growth rate of 1.0%: and
(iv) 1 Euro = USD 1.20.
Growth is based on the number of vessels expected to be under management based on the shipbuilding contracts in place at the end ofthe year and the long-temi

<<<

 strategy ofthe Group. Management believes that any reasonably possible further change in the key assumptions on which recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount ofthe cash-generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount

<<<

.

In accordance with the temis ofthe Plan

, there are only service condition requirements. The awards will be settled in cash or in shares at the sole discretion ofthe compensation committee ofthe board of directors. These awards have been treated as equity settled because the Group

 has no present obligation to settle in cash. The amount to be settled for each SAR exercised is computed in each case, as the excess, if any, ofthe fair market value (the closing price of shares) on the exercise date over the exercise price

 ofthe SAR.

Fair value

The fair value ofthe SARs has been calculated based on the Modified Black-Scholes-Merton method. Expected volatility was based on historical share price volatility forthe period since the Group's initial public offering

<<<

. The expected dividend is based on management's expectations of future payments on the grant date. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value ofthe SARs are set out below:

23. Financial Risk Management
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management

<<<

 program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group makes use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to moderate

<<<

 certain risk exposures.
Market risk
Interest rate risk: The Group is subject to market risks relating to changes in interest rates because it has floating rate debt outstanding. Significant increases in interest rates could adversely affect

<<<

 the Group's results of operations and its ability to service its debt. The Group uses interest rate swaps to reduce its exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates. The principal objective of these contracts is to minimize risks

<<<

 associated with its floating rate debt and not for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 31,2017, the Group has economically hedged 53.92% of its variable rate interest exposure relating to its existing loan facilities and the bonds

<<<

 by swapping the variable rate to a fixed rate (December31,2016: 37.77%).

017 (All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)
23. Financial Risk Management (Continued)
The aggregate principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt as of December 31,2017 was $1,077,016. As

<<<

 an indication of the extent of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, an increase in LIBOR by 10 basis points would increase the interest expense on the un-hedged portion of the Group's loans by approximately $1,264 (December 31,2016: $

<<<

1,433 and December31,2015: $1,315).
Interest rate sensitivity analysis: The fair value of the interest rate swaps as of December 31,2017 was estimated as a net asset of $10,325 (December 31,2016: net asset of $1,796). The effective movement

<<<

 in the fair value of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments (Note 25) amounting to $0 (December 31,2016: $4,922 loss and December 31,2015: $979 loss) was recognized directly in equity.
The interest rate swap agreements

<<<

 described below are subject to market risk as they are recorded at fair value in the statement of financial position at year end. The fair value of interest rate swap liabilities increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest

<<<

 rates increase. As of December 31, 2017, if interest rates had increased or decreased by 10 basis points with all other variables held constant, the positive/(negative) impact, respectively, on the fair value of the interest rate and cross

<<<

 currency swaps would have amounted to $4,724 (December 31,2016: $4,526 and December 31,2015: $3,349). This amount would have affected other comprehensive income by $308 (December 31,2016: $499 and December 31,2015: $1,483) and the gain/loss

<<<

 on swaps by $4,416 (December31,2016: $4,027and December 31,2015: $1,866).
Otherprice risk: The decrease in the fair value of Egypt LNG Shipping Ltd., in response to unfavorable market conditions resulting in a decrease in charter rates and

<<<

 vessel values, could negatively impact the value of the Group's investment in associate. Therefore, management might conclude that impairment is necessary in the future.
Currency risk: Currency risk is the risk that the value offinancial instruments

<<<

 and/orthe cost of commercial transactions will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the

<<<

 Group's subsidiaries' functional currency. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to general and crew costs denominated in Euros ("EUR"). Specifically, for the year ended

<<<

 December 31,2017, approximately $87,400 of the operating and administrative expenses were denominated in EUR (December 31,2016: $85,777 and December 31,2015: $78,131). As of December 31,2017, approximately $14,743 of the Group's outstanding

<<<

 trade payables and accruals were denominated in EUR (December 31,2016: $12,799).
The Group has entered into cross currency swaps (Note 25)to hedge its currency exposure from the NOK2021 Bonds and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge

<<<

 its currency exposure from payments in EUR and GBP. In addition, management monitors the exchange rate fluctuations on a continuous basis. As an indication of the extent ofthe Group's sensitivity to changes in exchange rate, a 10% increase

<<<

 in the average EUR/USD exchange rate would have decreased the Group's profit and cash flows during the year ended December 31,2017 by $8,740, based upon its expenses during the year (December 31, 2016: $8,578 and December 31,2015: $7,813).

23. Financial Risk Management (Continued)

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that arises when the maturity of assets and liabilities does not match. An unmatched position potentially enhances profitability, but can

<<<

 also increase the risk of losses. The Group minimizes liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and by having available adequate amounts of undrawn credit facilities. The Group is not significantly exposed to liquidity

<<<

 risk resulting from the commitments underthe vessel constmction contracts as bank facilities have been contracted to meet a significant proportion of the obligations.

The following tables detail the Group's expected cash flows for its non

<<<

-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal

 cash flows. Variable future interest payments were detennined based on an average LIBOR plus the margins applicable to the Group's loans at the end of each year presented.

 significant credit losses on its accounts receivable portfolio during the three years ended December 31,2017. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements represents the Group's maximum exposure

 because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Fair value measurements
The fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying amounts at the reporting date.
The fair

<<<

 value of the interest rate swaps at the end of reporting period was determined by discounting the future cash flows using the interest rate yield curves at the end of reporting period and the credit risk inherent in the contract. The fair value

<<<

 of the CCSs at the end ofthe reporting period was detemiined by discounting the future cash flows that are estimated based on forward exchange rates and contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk ofthe counterparties

<<<

. The Group uses its judgment to make assumptions that are primarily based on market conditions forthe estimation ofthe counterparty risk and the Group's own risk that are considered forthe calculation ofthe fair value ofthe interest rate and

<<<

 cross currency swaps. The interest rate swaps, the forward foreign exchange contracts and the CCSs meet Level 2 classification, according to the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. There were no financial instruments

<<<

 in Levels 1 or 3 and no transfers between Levels 1,2 or 3 during the periods presented. The definitions ofthe levels, provided by IFRS 13 are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

·

Level 1 fair value measurements are

<<<

 those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities:

·

Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs otherthan quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable forthe

asset or liability

<<<

, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices): and
