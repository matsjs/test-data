(c) the Loan shall continue to bear interest at a rate equal to the coupon rate of 25 per cent, p.a., such interest to be paid in full by the Borrower

<<<

 on the new Maturity Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the proposals set forth in this and the preceding paragraphs, involve that no default interest shall be payable in respect of the Loan or the Due Interest Amount if the Loan and the interest

<<<

 accrued thereon is paid in full on the new Maturity Date;
(d) that the requirement in the Loan Agreement for the creation of the Loan Security (ia a Share Pledge over all the Borrower's shares in Davie Yards Inc ("Davie")) shall be deleted

<<<

. The same applies to all provisions related to the sale of such shares and mandatory prepayments etc in respect of such sales; and
(e) that the Loan is converted to a subordinated loan (No: ansvarlig lån).
In order to obtain the requested Proposal

<<<

, Cecon has requested that the Trustee summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider whether the Proposal should be approved.
The Borrower's evaluation of the Proposal and additional comments
Given Cecon's current liquidity position, a successful

<<<

 completion of the Proposal will be necessary for Cecon to continue its operations and further explore alternatives in relation to the on-going restructuring process of Davie. Although potential outcomes of such alternatives are highly uncertain

<<<

, a failure to complete the Proposal would, in the Borrower's opinion, significantly deteriorate values for the Bondholders, as well as other stakeholders.
Further to the proposed deletion of the Loan Security (as set out in paragraph (d) in

<<<

 the Proposal), and taking into account Davie's current financial situation and on-going restructuring process, it seems reasonable to attribute little or no value to the Borrower's shares in Davie. Furthermore, Cecon will have to incorporate

<<<

 a new Norwegian limited liability company to create such a share pledge, which will cost the Borrower approx NOK 120,000. Hence, and in light of the Borrower's current liquidity situation, it does not appear to be in the interest of neither

<<<

 Cecon nor the Bondholders to create such a share pledge.
For the avoidance of doubt, the additional Bonds issued upon the effectuation of the Payment In Kind shall have the same rights as the existing Bonds as of the registration of the additional

<<<

 Bonds in the Securities Depository. The Payment In Kind involves that the amount of the Loan, and thereby the basis for the calculation of interest during the period from the Bondholders' approval and granting of the Proposal to the new Maturity

<<<

 Date, will increase from USD 10 million to USD 12.5 million.
The Trustee's evaluation of the Proposal
The Bondholders must themselves evaluate whether the Proposal should be granted. It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with their

<<<

 own advisors and tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences of the Proposal.

<<<

 three vessels for Cecon ASA ("Cecon" and "the Company") and has indicated that delays in delivery and increased costs which may be significant for Cecon may be expected.
On March 15, 2010 Cecon initiated a rapid and detailed assessment of the

<<<

 performance on Cecon's three vessels under construction at the Davie yard. Cecon engaged companies with specialized capability In the marine industry and shipbuilding to support this external assessment process. These companies ("the Alliance

<<<

") included, Upper Lakes Marine & Industrial Inc., SNC-Lavalin Defence Contractors inc., DRS Technologies Inc., and Fincantieri SPA.
On April 15, 2010 Davie Yards announced that the Corporation is taking further steps to preserve its working

<<<

 capital while restructuring it operations and financing.
Davie will suspend further production activities on board the first vessel to be delivered, starting Monday, April 19, 2010. Shipbuilding activities will continue in engineering and planning

<<<

Going forward
Since the announcement of Davie filing for CCAA protection

<<<

 Cecon has been very active in searching for possible solutions in order to ensure delivery of its vessels and minimize cost. Through this work, Cecon has concluded that teaming up with the Alliance is the preferred strategy,
However, in the

<<<

 ongoing CCAA process at Davie will at least last until 25 May, and Cecon still consider it to be significant uncertainty regarding completion of the vessels and Davie Yards' financing situation.
As a result of the delays on Davy Yard and the

<<<

 limited current cash liquidity of Cecon, It is uncertain whether Cecon will be able to meet the upcoming interest payments to its bondholders, Cecon and the Alliance together with its financial advisors are currently investigating different

<<<

 options to meet Upcoming payments and will provide updates as soon as possible.
