 specific requirements.

Marketing Update:
Marketing efforts have intensified since January. There are more than 15 independent enquiries. This includes short-term contracts (less than six months) for wind farms in Europe, and longer-term contracts

<<<

 (six months to three years) in Africa and Mexico. Some of the enquiries were from operators and rig management companies who expressed interest in the areas of crewing and management.
Most of the enquiries led to them visiting and inspecting

 the Troll Solution. Many who visited Troll Solution gave positive feedbacks that Troll Solution meet the requirements. Among them were prospective clients in Africa, Mexico and UK..

Rig Manager:
We have reviewed seven potential rig managers

<<<

 and some have indicated willingness to manage Troll Solution on our behalf. Not all of them can operate in the areas we are looking to contract to and therefore our selection of the rig manager is subject to location and client. One rig manager

<<<

 has been appointed for Mexico and approved by Pemex.

M arketing Brokers:
We have interviewed ten brokers and none of them have been given exclusive contracts since each of them have limited area of operations or client base. We have, however

<<<

, nominated some brokers specifically for certain clients that they have proven to perform best with. All other brokers are to deal with us on a subject-to confirmation basis.
