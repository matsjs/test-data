 to the Loan Agreement

1 INTRODUCTION

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the bond issue "FRN Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012" with ISIN NO 001 036172.8 (the "Loan

<<<

") where Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd (the "Company") is the issuer and borrower.

All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Loan (the "Loan Agreement") between

<<<

 the Company and the Loan Trustee dated 11 April 2007.

The information in this summons regarding the Company has been provided by the Company, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.



<<<

2 BACKGROUND

Since commencing operations in 2007, the Company has experienced several operational challenges which have materially impacted its profitability and cash flow. These operational challenges include overruns on capital expenditure

<<<

 on their vessel conversions, marine issues due to weather and currents, and incidents that have led to significant repair costs. Day rates and unit utilization have also been below expectation for the MSV Rubicon Maverick. In addition, vessel

<<<

 operating expenses, as well as sales, general and administrative costs have been higher than expected.

Given the above background, in addition to making some important management changes, including the previously announced appointment of a

<<<

 new CEO and a new COO, the Company has sought to amend the terms of the Loan Agreement and, to this end, has been in discussions with an ad hoc group of bondholders owning USD 125.5 million in aggregate of the Bonds (amounting to 69.7% of the

<<<

 Bonds) (collectively, the "Ad hoc Group"). Members of the Ad hoc Group have retained Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP as bondholder counsel ("Bondholder Counsel") at the Company's cost to assist with restructuring discussions. The Company has

<<<

 informed the Loan Trustee that the members of the Ad hoc Group have entered into voting agreements with the Company agreeing to vote their Bonds in favour of the Proposal as set forth in paragraph 3 {Proposal) below and Schedule 1 {Amended

<<<

 and Restated Loan Agreement).

During the discussions with the Ad hoc Group, in September and October 2010, the Company gave a presentation to those bondholders which contained certain material non-public information on the Company. A copy

<<<

 of this presentation (with some additional information provided to the Ad hoc Group) is available for viewing on the website maintained by the Loan Trustee, www.stamdata.no.
