 2017/2020

Oslo, 18 October 2017

NOTICE OF A WRITTEN BONDHOLDERS' RESOLUTIONS - WAIVER REQUEST AND PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE BOND AGREEMENT

Nordic Trustee AS (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in

<<<

 the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") with NSA Bondco Limited as issuer (the "Issuer").

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Bond Issue dated 27 September 2017 (the

<<<

 "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein.

The Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to issue this request for a written Bondholders' resolution pursuant to Clause 16.5 (Written Bondholders' Resolutions) of the Bond Agreement to consider

<<<

 the approval of the Proposed Resolution (including the waiver request in respect of the Insurance Breach (as defined below)), as further set out below.

The information in this notice regarding the Issuer and market conditions isprovided by

<<<

 the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.

1.

BACKGROUND

Pursuant to clause 13.6(d) (Vessel covenants) of the Bond Agreement the Issuer is required to, among

other things,

<<<

 ensure that the Vessel at all times shall be adequately insured (including war risk) against

Hull & Machinery risks of at least 120% of the outstanding amount under the Existing Finance

Documents.

As at the date of this notice, the current

<<<

 aggregate amount outstanding under the Existing Finance Documents is c.$138 million. However, the level of insurance coverage in place totals $160 million which is well in excess of the aggregate amount outstanding, but c.$5 million less than

<<<

 the 120% requirement under clause 13.6(d) (Vessel covenants) of the Bond Agreement. Consequently, there is a technical breach under the Bond Agreement (the "Insurance Breach"). However, considering that the Vessel is currently in lay-up, the

<<<

 risk of a Total Loss is remote.

The commercial advisors (AMA) have sourced replacement insurance coverage with the intention of remedying the Insurance Breach as soon as reasonably practicable. The new insurance will be in an amount of $1

<<<

00 million against Hull & Machinery risks and a third party liability insurance as per industry standards.

Accordingly, the Issuer has requested the Bondholders consent to:

<<<

) of the Bond Agreement as a result of the Insurance Breach by no later than 28 October 2017 (the "Waiver").

2.2 Amendment to the Bond Agreement To implement the Proposed Resolution (as defined below) the Bond Agreement will need to be amended

<<<

 (the "Amendment") as follows:

Clause 13.6(d) (Vessel covenants) will be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

"The Issuer shall ensure that the Vessel at all times shall be adequately insured (including war risk) against

<<<

 Hull & Machinery risks o f an amount o f $100m and a thirdparty liability insurance as per industry standards, as well as any additional insurance required under any other contracts.

The Bond Trustee shall be entitled to take out a Mortgagee

<<<

's Interest Insurance and a Mortgagee's Additional Perils (Pollution) Insurance (or similar insurances) at the cost o f the Issuer.

The insurances and Loss Payee Clause shall be in accordance with the Nordic Marine Insurance Plan or other insurances

<<<

 with at least similar terms. "

2.3 The Proposed Resolution The Issuer requests that the Bondholders adopt the following resolutions (the "Proposed Resolutions"):

A. approve the Waiver.

B. approve the Amendment.

The members of the Advisory

<<<
