<<<

 Series of Index Linked Bonds interest shall be calculated based on a period from and including the Issue Date for such Series and to, but excluding the first Interest Payment Date for such Series. The calculation shall promptly and no later

 the Issuer and the Bond Trustee together shall seek to agree for the purpose of the Index Linked Bonds one or more adjustments to the Index or a substitute index (with or without adjustments) with the intention that the same should leave the

<<<

, the Issuer and the Bondholders and the Issuer shall give notice of such amendments to the Bondholders as promptly as practicable following such notification.
If at any time and from time to time the Index is changed by the substitution of

 a new base therefore then, with effect from the calendar month from and including that in which such substitution takes effect, the Applicable Base CPI Figure for each Series of Index Linked Bonds shall be changed to the product of the Applicable

 calculation of interest for Nominal Bonds
Interest due on any Nominal Bonds on each Interest Payment Date shall be calculated by the Securities Register on the basis of the aggregated principal amount of the outstanding Nominal Bonds. The Issuer

<<<

 shall pay interest in an amount equal to the Applicable Interest Rate applied to the aggregated principal amount of the outstanding Nominal Bonds for the period from, and including, one Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next following

 applicable Interest Payment Date. For the first Interest Payment Date for each Series of Nominal Bonds interest shall be calculated based on a period from and including the Issue Date for such Series and to, but excluding the first Interest
