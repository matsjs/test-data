 Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010 with Warrants

Oslo, 28 May 2010
Sale of subsidiary, etc - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned bond issue with ISIN N0001037392.1 (the "Loan

<<<

") issued by Camo AS (the "Borrower") formerly incorporated as Camo ASA. The Loan is issued on terms set out in a loan agreement dated 4 June 2007 and subsequent amendment agreements (the "Loan Agreement"). Capitalized terms used herein shall

<<<

 have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement, or in this summons.
The information in this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever

<<<

 related to such information.

1. Background

Reference is made to the attached Company Presentation from the Borrower where the Borrower describes the situation in more detail. The summons and the Company Presentation should be read together

<<<

.

The Borrower has two 100% owned subsidiaries, Proteans Software Solutions Pvt ltd ("Proteans") a company incorporated in Bangalore India and Camo Software AS ("Camo Software") a company incorporated in Norway, with company registration number

<<<

 983 522 955. Unaudited financial figures for 2009 show that Proteans contributed revenue of approximately USD 8 200 000 while the consolidated figures for the group show total revenue of approx USD 10 500 000 Proteans had a net income of approximately

<<<

 USD 690 000 for the year 2009, compared to a net loss of approximately USD - 825 000 for the group on a consolidated basis.

According to the Borrower, the market shows signs of improving. Further, Camo Software has recently launched a new

<<<

 product The Uscrambler X . The development of the product has contributed to the cost, and may now contribute to the revenue growth going forward. Combined, these factors contribute positively to the income potential of the remaining subsidiary

<<<

 of the Borrower going forward.

According to the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is restricted from selling substantial parts of its assets. A Bondholders Meeting held 15.05.2009 granted a time limited permission to sell the Proteans subsidiary

<<<

, which has now expired.

NO RSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' Meeting to approve the sale of the subsidiary Proteans, and certain other amendments to the terms of the Loan. The Borrower has a concrete offer

<<<

 for the subsidiary, and is in the final stages of implementing the sale.

2. The Proposal
The Borrower proposes that the Bondholders approve the sale of Proteans as set out in this summons, and waive any clauses of the Loan Agreement restricting

<<<

 the sale.
The Borrower proposes that the net sale proceeds after deducting transaction cost, tax related to the transaction, approximately NOK 5 000 000 for servicing due obligations of the Borrower, and approximately NOK 5 000 000 of working

<<<

 capital for Camo Software (the "Redemption Amount") shall be employed for a partial early redemption of the Loan (the "Early Partial Redemtion"). It is expected that the Redemption Amount will be approximately NOK 30 000 000 The amounts are

<<<

 approximate, as the net amount will vary with transaction and tax costs, and the NOK amount will vary with the USD/NOK fx rate. The Early Partial Redemption shall be carried out pro rata between the bondholders, at 102.5% of par plus accrued

<<<

 interest on the redeemed Bonds, which corresponds to the redemption price at Maturity approved in connection with the previous waiver for the sale.
The Early Partial Redemption shall be carried out without undue delay after the Borrower receives

<<<

 the sale proceeds and at the latest before end of June 2010. The Bondholders give the Loan Trustee the authority to extend this deadline at the discretion of the Loan Trustee.
The Borrower proposes that the Maturity Date of the Loan is extended

<<<

 from 15.12.2010 to 15.06.2012 for the Bonds remaining after the Early Partial Redemption.
The Interest payment that was due 15.12.2009 was added to the principal amount to be paid/redeemed at the Maturity Date. The current proposal includes

<<<

 a postponement of the Maturity Date, which implies that this interest amount will not be redeemed on 15.12.2010 as earlier described.
The Loan shall continue with Interest payment dates on the 15 December each year. Consequently, Interest accrued

<<<

 for the period 15.12.2009 until 15.12.2010 on the bonds that are not redeemed shall be due 15.12.2010. The Borrower shall have the option to make the Interest payments in the form of new Bonds (Payment in kind), or in the form of cash at the

<<<

 Borrowers discretion.
The Loan Agreement shall be amended to include a call option for the Borrower giving the Borrower the right to Call the Loan (in full or partially) at any time at 102.5% of par plus accrued interest. Redemption by exercise

<<<

 of the Call option shall be carried out Pro-rata between the Bondholders.
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether

<<<

 the proposed changes are acceptable.

 Update in connection with a Bondholders' Meeting in the "10,5 % CAMO AS Senior Unsecured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010 with warrants between" CAMO AS and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA.
Introduction
CAMO AS (CAMO) has for some time been working to divest

<<<

 one of its two subsidiaries Proteans Software Solution Ltd (Proteans). CAMO has signed a Share Purchase Agreement with a Indian based Buyer on the terms and conditions listed below. In order to formally comply with the terms in the Loan agreement

<<<

, CAMO will arrange for a bondholders meeting to get an approval for the divestment.
The major reason for the divestment of Proteans is to secure funding to reduce the CAMO debt, and also provide for working capital for the growth of the CAMO

<<<

 subsidiary CAMO Software AS.
The divestment
The 1st of February 2010 a LOI was signed with a potential buyer of Proteans. The Due Diligence is now completed, and CAMO will sign a SPA with closing and payment shortly thereafter.
The Terms and

<<<

 Conditions for the sale of all the shares of Proteans are as follows:
· Up front Purchase consideration of USD 7,5 mill · USD 1 mill Earn Out commission, based on Total Sales for the Indian financial year
31.04.2010-01.05.2011. · The first

<<<

 USD 250,000,- of the commission will be earned in a total sales bracket from USD 9
mill to USD 9,75 mill pro rata. · The remaining USD 750,000 of the commission will be paid pro rata of total sales starting
from USD 9,75 mill up to USD 10,

 USD 714,000 (USD 829,000), 2008 figures in brackets.

The estimated investment cost for the more than 2 year project was about USD 1 mill. These investment costs and the negative cash flow from the 2009 operation of about USD 300,000 resulted in a negative

Despite a 50% reduction in CAMO operating expenses and the freeze of the bond interest payments for the year, another USD 450K in negative cash flow accumulated during 2009 at holding

<<<

 company level.

With Proteans generating about USD 500,000 in net operating cash flow, consolidated cash outflow for the CAMO Group mounted to around USD 750,000,- for the year.

NOK 3,5 mill (USD 550) was raised in equity in July 2009, and

 cash flow late fall was very tight. Since December 2009 Proteans has repaid most of their intercompany debt to CAMO to provide funding for CAMO SW and CAMO .

CAMO Software has made a strong recovery from Q1 2009 with a 60% increase in total

<<<

 sales for Q1 2010. The sales for the division is well ahead on budget, and is expected to continue the positive progress of outperforming budget figures for 2010 and generate positive cash flow for the year 2010. The release of The Unscrambler

 X and a planned new range of products is expected to have a positive effect on total sales for the rest of the year.
