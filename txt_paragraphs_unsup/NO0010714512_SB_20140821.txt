Oslo, 21 August 2014
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Trustee") for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue ISIN NO 001 071451.2 (with total outstanding amount

<<<

 of NOK 700 million) (the "Bond Issue") issued by EXMAR NV (the "Issuer").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 4 July 2014 and made between the Trustee and the Issuer (the "Bond

<<<

 Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. References to Clauses and paragraphs are references to Clauses and paragraphs in the Bond Agreement.
The information in this summons regarding the legal, operational and financial status of the Issuer

<<<

 is provided by the Issuer. The Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information given from the Issuer.
1. BACKGROUND
The Issuer is a leading independent LNG and LPG carrier owner and operator listed on

<<<

 NYSE Euronext Brussels. The Issuer raised its first bond issue of NOK 700 million in July 2014 with the purpose of financing new investments in LNG infrastructure assets and offshore assets as well as for general corporate purposes.
According

<<<

 to Belgium tax legislation, interest income from a company incorporated in Belgium is subject to 25 per cent withholding tax (the "Withholding Tax"). However, a domestic exemption from the Withholding Tax exists for nominative bonds for interest

<<<

 paid to non-resident investors (the "Exemption"). The Exemption only applies if the non-resident is not subject to notably more advantageous income tax regime than in Belgium. Furthermore, the bondholders must hold the nominative bond during

<<<

 the entire interest period in order to benefit from the Exemption. The company issuing the bonds should hold a register of the nominative bondholders, such register to contain accurate information with respect to the identity of the bondholders

<<<

, the number of securities held and the period of holding. Following the close of the Bond Issue, the Issuer became aware that such information cannot be provided by the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) and the Exemption as such

<<<

 will not be applicable.
According to clause 14.5 (a) and clause 14.5 (b) (i) of the Bond Agreement the Issuer is required to gross up the payments due under the Bond Agreement to such amount which is necessary to ensure that the Bondholders

<<<

 receive a net amount which is equal to the payment that would have been due if no Withholding Tax had been applicable.
With the current applicable Withholding Tax, the effective interest rate payable under the Bond Agreement for the Issuer

<<<

 will be significantly higher, and the cash position and credit quality of the Issuer will be negatively affected going forward. To avoid such negative effects, the Issuer requests to amend the issuer under the Bond Agreement. For further information

<<<

, please see section 2 below.
2. PROPOSAL
In accordance with Clause 17.1 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has approached the Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting in order to obtain the Bondholders' approval to the proposed amendments to

<<<

 the Bond Agreement as described below, pursuant to the authority given to the Bondholders' Meeting under Clause 16.1 of the Bond Agreement.
The Issuer proposes the following (the "Proposal"):
2.1 Amendment of Issuer
Based on the background

<<<

 information set out above, the Issuer proposes to change the issuer under the Bond Agreement from EXMAR NV to EXMAR Netherlands BV (the "New Issuer"). EXMAR Netherlands BV is a 100% owned subsidiary of EXMAR NV domiciled in the Netherlands

<<<

, a jurisdiction where there is no applicable Withholding Tax. The sole purpose of the New Issuer is Group financing activities.

NORDIC TRUSTEE
2.2 Guarantee from EXMAR NV
The Issuer will issue an irrevocable guarantee (Norwegian: "selvskyldnerkausjon

's obligations under the amended Bond Agreement, including payment obligations at such times and in such amounts as it would have been liable for as Issuer under the current Bond Agreement.
2.3 Amendments to the Bond Agreement

<<<

<<<

 as Parent and Guarantor;
the Guarantee as described above will be included in the Bond Agreement;
amendments will be made to ensure conformity to the current structure and terms and conditions of the Bond Issue (other than as described above

<<<

), hereunder to ensure that representations, covenants, undertakings, restrictions, exceptions and baskets will be applicable on the Parent and the Group similar to what it would have been if EXMAR NV remained as Issuer under the Bond Agreement

<<<

. This will include, but not be limited to:
o the definition of Group to include the Parent and its Subsidiaries; o change of control provisions on both the Parent and the New Issuer; o representations from both the Parent and the New Issuer

<<<

 as applicable; o information- and financial covenants applicable on the Parent (consolidated as in the current Bond

To enable the Issuer to conduct the proposed change of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has requested the Trustee to summon

 a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes.
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed

<<<
