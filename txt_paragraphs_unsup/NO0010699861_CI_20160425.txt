BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT - 2015

The company

The North Alliance AS (NOA) is a group of companies offering services within

<<<

 marketing communication, design and technology. The family of companies operates in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, and Singapore.

The group was founded on January 23, 2014 when NOA acquired the following companies:

Making Waves Group (NO

<<<

, SE and PL) Akestam Holst Group
o Akestam Holst (SE) o Bold (SE, DK) o StudioNOC (SE) o Promenad (SE) Great Works (SE, DK) AndCo (DK)

Design & Technology
Advertising Design Brand Experience Action Marketing and CRM Digital communication Advertising

<<<



In addition, Anorak (NO, Advertising) was acquired in October 2014 and in January 2015 NOA established the advertising company Acoustic in Singapore, a digital centric company that will work in the cross section between communication and technology

<<<

. During Q4 2015, Bold has established operations in Oslo, in addition to the current locations in Stockholm and Copenhagen.
In January 2016 NOA acquired the Swedish/American digital development and communication company Nansen. Nansen has over

<<<

 100 employees in Stockholm, Chicago and New York. The acquisition of Nansen will strengthen the Groups digital offering in the Swedish market and will together with Making Waves become a strong entity in the Nordics.

Financial results

Total

<<<

 operating revenue for the year amounted to 761.7 MNOK. Total net revenue for the year amounted to 534.4 MNOK. This represents 19,5 % growth compared to the 2014 group revenue figures. Group EBITDA for the year came in at 20.7 MNOK. Adjusted

<<<

 for transaction costs and one-offs, EBITDA for the year was about 29 MNOK. Exchange rate fluctuations have also had impact of the reported profits.
The North Alliance has seen a good operational cash conversion. The cash flow has been affected

<<<

 by financing and investing activities. Main effect is paid in capital due to issuance of shares related to the acquisition of Nansen January 2016. In total this amounts to 31,7 MNOK. Finance cost, depreciations and changes in working capital

<<<

 have been the most important elements affecting the cash flow from operating activities.
The group has a very strong cash position at 31.12.2015.

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements

The Company's (holding) income in

<<<

 2014 was MNOK 15,2 and is solely related to inter company management services (2014: MNOK 14,2). The operating loss was MNOK -2,4 (2014: 16,5) and the annual result aftertax was MNOK- 2 ,2 (2014: -9,3).

It is proposed that NoA's loss for the

<<<

 year after tax should be allocated as follows (MNOK):

Dividend Transferred from other equity

20^,02

Total allocated

2,2

Total equity for the NoA Group per 31.12.2015 was MNOK 399.1 and total assets were 790.6 MNOK.

Going concern

The

<<<

 financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern assumption. This assessment is based on the group's expectations for 2016, a satisfactory liquidity position and undrawn credit facilities. The Board of Directors believes

<<<

 that the financial statements provide a fair presentation of NoA's assets and liabilities, financial position and results.
Subsequent events

In January 2016 NOA acquired the Swedish/American digital development and communication company Nansen

<<<

. Nansen has over 100 employees in Stockholm, Chicago and New York.

External environment
The group does not produce goods or services that use environmentally hazardous input factors. The environmental awareness of the group's main suppliers

<<<

 is being assessed as part of the group's procurement process.

Employees and working environment
The group attaches great importance to health, safety and environment, and activities in this area are organised by the working environment committee

<<<

, the sports and recreation organisation and HR. Cooperation with the employees' organisations has been satisfactory. The sickness absence rate for the group was in average 6% during 2015. The group is constantly working to reduce the sickness

<<<

 absence rate. One minor accident (sprained leg) was reported during 2015. Many nationalities are represented both in Norway and abroad, and the employees work well together. The group has a recruitment and HR policy that ensures equal opportunities

<<<

 and rights, while preventing discrimination.
Equal opportunities
In 2015, NoA had an average of 561 employees, 34% of them women. At the end of 2015 the group's Board of Directors had five members elected by shareholders, all men. The

3



<<<

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
group's administrative management consisted of one woman and two men in 2015. In the subsidiaries, 33% are headed by women and 67% by men.
Research and development
The group does not

<<<

 have any costs that are classified as research and development. It nevertheless commits substantial resources to developing its activities in digital technologies platforms. This is a constant area of focus but all of these costs have currently

<<<

 been expensed in the income statement.
Corporate governance and company management
NoA aims to follow the recommendations of the Oslo Stock Exchange with regard to good corporate governance and company management. A good reputation and good

<<<

 financial development are prerequisites for building and maintaining confidence among important target groups such as shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, partners and public authorities. This requires that the company will be managed

<<<

 using good control and management mechanisms. Open, honest communication and equal treatment of the company's share- and bondholders are also important when it comes to increasing value and inspiring confidence. The company has rules and guidelines

<<<

 for the Board of Directors and the CEO.
Work of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors regularly receives a group-reporting package containing financial information on the group and the individual group companies. The Board also regularly

<<<

 receives management's comments on developments during the year. The company's strategy is discussed on a broad basis at an extended Board Meeting every year. There is also a rotating review of subsidiaries at individual Board Meetings. The

<<<

 Board of Directors evaluate their work annually.
Risk management and internal control
The group is exposed to various types of financial risk linked to ordinary operations. In the short term this involves unpredictable advertising markets in

<<<

 particular, but also technical business interruptions and distribution. The group therefore has comprehensive systems in place for monitoring and dealing with such situations. The group is exposed to risks associated with operations in several

<<<

 foreign currencies. This risk is assessed continuously. The group focuses on outstanding receivables and the Board of Directors judges the risk of significant losses to be relatively small. Historically losses have been insignificant. Through

<<<

 the listed bond with floating rate the group is exposed to interest rate risk that may affect the cash flow.
Remuneration of senior employees
NoA attaches importance to being an attractive employer. The company wants to attract skilled employees

<<<

 with relevant experience. The company therefore aims to have a competitive remuneration system.
Auditor The company uses the same audit firm for all its major subsidiaries in all the markets where it is active. The overall auditing quote is

<<<

 discussed and approved by the Board of
4

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements Directors and CEO. The auditor is not used as a consultant for strategic matters. The CFO approves any consultancy assignments. The auditor

<<<

 attends the Board Meeting at which the financial statements are discussed. The board of directors of The North Alliance AS, Oslo April 19, 2016.

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes 1 - Accounting Principles
General information
The North Alliance

<<<

 AS is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Norway with offices at Kristian IV's gate 15 in Oslo.
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements for The North Alliance AS ("the Group") are prepared in accordance

<<<

 with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and required for the financial year beginning 1 January 2015 or later, as well as Norwegian disclosure requirements pursuant to the Accounting Act per

<<<

 31 December 2015.
Comparative figures for the income statement have also been prepared for 31 December 2014.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation

<<<

 of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through equity or the statement of income.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions

<<<

 and events under similar conditions.
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from

<<<

 its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the

<<<

 date that control ceases.
The group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred

<<<

 to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred includes the air value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired

<<<

 and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition

<<<

 basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved

<<<

 in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognized in the

<<<

 income statement.
11

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent

<<<

 consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in the income statement or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured

<<<

, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the

<<<

 acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognized and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of

<<<

 the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognized directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are

<<<

 eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. When necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the group's accounting policies.
(b) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

<<<


Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions - that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration

<<<

 paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
(c) Disposal of subsidiaries
When the group

<<<

 ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is re- measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognized in the income statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount

<<<

 for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for

<<<

 as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.
Foreign currency translation
a) Functional

<<<

 and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The functional

<<<

 currency is mainly NOK, SEK and DKK. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Norwegian Kroner ("NOK"), which is the group's presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into

<<<

 the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
12

The

<<<

 North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive

<<<

 income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within 'finance income or costs'. All

<<<

 other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within 'Other (losses)/gains - net'.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or

<<<

 loss are recognized in the income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available for sale, are included in other comprehensive income.
(c

<<<

) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the

<<<

 presentation currency as follows:
assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange

<<<

 rates;
all resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.
Revenue recognition
The group sells services within marketing communication, design and technology. For sales of services, revenue is recognized in the

<<<

 accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction and assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total service to be provided.
Revenue is measured

<<<

 at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, adjusted for any trade discounts or volume rebates allowed by the group. Revenue is recognized only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction

<<<

 will flow to the Group.
When the outcome of a transaction involving rendering of services can be measured reliably, revenue associated with the transaction is recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end

<<<

 of the reporting period. The outcome of a transaction is considered to be reliably measured when all of the following conditions are met;
(a) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
(b) it is probable that future economic benefits will

<<<

 flow to the entity;
(c) stage of completion can be measured reliably; and
(d) the costs incurred and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
13

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
Segment reporting

<<<


Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of

<<<

 the operating segments, has been identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions.
The steering committee considers the business from a geographic perspective. This is the performance of the segment Norway, Sweden and Denmark

<<<

. Holding companies are included as they are administrative centers
Income tax
Tax expense recognized in the statement of income comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity

<<<

.
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claim from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. The calculation of current tax is based

<<<

 on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Management continuously reviews the positions that are claimed in the tax returns where the applicable tax regulation is subject to

<<<

 interpretation. Based on these evaluations, provisions for anticipated tax payments are made, as necessary.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and

<<<

 liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided ion the initial recognition of goodwill, or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or

<<<

 accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in

<<<

 the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be utilized against future taxable income, based on the Group's forecast of future operating results which are adjusted for significant

<<<

 non-taxable income and expenses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group has a right and intention to set off current tax assets and liabilities from the same taxation authority.
Fixed assets
Property, plant and equipment

<<<

 (PPE) is recognized when the cost of an asset can be reliably measured and it is probable that the entity will obtain future economic benefits from the asset.
All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation

<<<

. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that

<<<

 future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the
14

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
replaced part is derecognized

<<<

. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost

<<<

 or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Machinery and equipment: 3-8 years
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting

<<<

 period.
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds

<<<

 with the carrying amount and are recognized within "Other operating expenses" in the income statement.
Investment in associates
Companies over which the Group has a significant but not controlling influence (20-50% of shares or votes) are classified

<<<

 as investment in associates and are accounted for using the equity method. This means that the investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the Group's share of the profit

<<<

 or loss of the associated company after the date of acquisition.
Leased assets
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk of ownership is retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. The Group has no capital

<<<

 leases. Where the Group is a lessee, payments on operating lease agreements are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Associated costs, such as maintenance and insurance, are expensed as incurred.
Trade and

<<<

 other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business

<<<

 if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables

 is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account

<<<

 Financial Statements
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 'other operating expenses' in the income statement.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises at the acquisition of subsidiaries

<<<

 and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over The North Alliance AS's interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling

<<<

 interest in the acquiree. Goodwill is not depreciated and is recognized in the statement of financial position at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination

<<<

 is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the

<<<

 goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential

<<<

 impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognized immediately as an expense and is not subsequently

<<<

 reversed.
(b) Tradenames
Separately acquired tradenames are recognized initially at cost. The purchase price of a separately acquired intangible asset incorporates assumptions about the probable economic future benefits that may be generated

<<<

 by the asset. Tradenames acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Tradenames are not depreciated and are recognized in the statement of financial position at cost less any accumulated impairment

<<<

 losses.
(c) Research and development
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Expenses relating to development are capitalized and reported as intangible assets in

<<<

 the balance sheet if the following criteria are met in full:
- the product or process is clearly defined and its cost can be identified and measured reliably - the technical solution for the product has been demonstrated - the product or process

<<<

 will be sold or used in the company's operations - the asset will generate future economic benefit; and - sufficient technical, financial and other resources for completing the project are present
The directly attributable costs that are capitalized

<<<

 as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of the relevant overheads.
Amounts invested in product development are capitalized and depreciated under the straight line method over

<<<

 the expected useful life of the product.
16

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
(d) Non-contractual customer relationships
Non- contractual customer relationship represents intangible assets purchased through the effect

<<<

 of business combinations. Non- contractual relationships are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. They have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using the straight

<<<

-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful lives.
(e) Order backlog
Order backlog represents intangible assets purchased through the effect of business combinations. Order backlog relationships are recognized at fair value

<<<

 at the acquisition date. They have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over the estimated useful lives.
Impairment of non

<<<

-financial assets
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment

<<<

 whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount

<<<

 is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units).

<<<

 Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
Financial assets
Classification
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value

<<<

 through profit or loss, and loans and receivables, The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Financial

<<<

 assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in

<<<

 the short term. Derivatives are also categorized as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as

<<<

 non-current.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater

<<<

 than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The group's loans and receivables comprise "trade and other receivables" and "cash and cash equivalents" in the balance sheet.

 Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade-date - the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are

<<<

 initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value, and transaction

<<<

 costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards

<<<

 of ownership. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' category

<<<

 are presented in the income statement within Other (losses)/gains - net' in the period in which they arise. Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in the income statement as part of other income

<<<

 when the group's right to receive payments is established.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid

<<<

 investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity

<<<

. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration

<<<

 paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued

<<<

, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the company's equity holders.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration

<<<

, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognized when: the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount

<<<

 can be reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood

<<<

 that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations

<<<

 may be small.
18

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market

<<<

 assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services

<<<

 that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not

<<<

, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred

<<<

.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest

<<<

 method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw

<<<

-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it

<<<

 relates.
Employee benefits
Pension obligations
The Group has defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. After the contribution has been made

<<<

 the company has no further legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The contribution

<<<

 is recognized as personnel expenses.
When an employee has rendered service, the contribution payable to the defined contribution plan is recognized as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting contribution already paid. If the contribution

<<<

 due for service before the end of the reporting period, the excess is recognized as an asset (prepaid expense) to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.
Interest income
Interest income is

<<<

 recognized using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate

<<<

 of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loan and receivables is recognized using the original effective interest rate.
19

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements

<<<


Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognized as a liability in the group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company's shareholders.
Contingent liabilities

<<<

 and assets
Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements. In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, no liability is recognized

<<<

. A contingent asset is not recognized in the financial statements but disclosed if it is probable that the benefit will flow to the Group.
Changes in accounting policies
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting

<<<

 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the requirements relating to the offset of financial assets and financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments clarify the meaning of "currently has legally enforceable

<<<

 right of set-off" and "simultaneous realization and settlement". The amendments have been applied retrospectively. As the Group does not have any financial assets and financial liabilities that qualify for offset, the application of the amendments

<<<

 has had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognized in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amounts Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets The amendment removed certain disclosures of the

<<<

 recoverable amount of cash-generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives had been allocated when there has been no impairment or reversal of impairment of the related CGU. Furthermore, the

<<<

 amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements applicable to when the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is measured at fair value less costs of disposal. These new disclosures include fair value hierarchy, key assumptions and

<<<

 valuation techniques used which are in line with the disclosure required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements. The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures in the Group's consolidated financial statements

<<<

.
Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting The amendment considers legislative changes to 'over-the-counter' derivatives and the establishment of central counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives

<<<

 to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria. The Group has applied the amendment

<<<

 and there has been no significant impact on the Group consolidated financial statements as a result.
IFRIC21 Levies The interpretation sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37 

<<<

'Provisions'. The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognized. The amendments have been applied retrospectively. The Group is not currently subjected to significant

<<<

 levies so the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements is not material.
20

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
Standards, amendments and interpretations of existing standards that have not come into force

<<<

 and where the Group has not chosen early implementation
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2015, and have not been applied in preparing these

<<<

 consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The standard addresses the classification

<<<

, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments

<<<

. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification depends on

<<<

 the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to

<<<

 present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement

<<<

 except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge

<<<

 effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ""hedged ratio"" to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation

<<<

 is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9's full impact

<<<

.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue

<<<

 and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard

<<<

 replaces IAS 18 'Revenue' and IAS 11 'Construction contracts' and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted. The Group is assessing the impact

<<<

 of IFRS 15.
There are no other IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations that have not yet come into effect that are expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements There are no other standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that are

<<<

 expected to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant management judgment in applying accounting policies When preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management undertakes a number of judgments

<<<

, estimates and assumptions about the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities

<<<

 within the next financial year are discussed below. Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The Group tests for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as necessary, or at a minimum annually (note 5). The recoverable

 amount of cash-generating units is based on the valuein-use calculation. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 5).

Goodwill The Group's goodwill per 31 December 2015 amounts to NOK 271 m illion. This amount is related to the acquisitions of all the companies m adejointly in 2014. All companies acquired jointly in 2014 are defined in four cash-generating

<<<

 units (CGU) used in the valuation of goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated by management per CGU and monitored based on the performance of theCGUs. The recoverable amount of each CGU is calculated based on a value in use method.

The present value

<<<

 of the expected cash flows of each segment was determined using an average discount rate of 9,3 %. after tax. This is based on a risk free interest rate of 1 %, plus a risk premium and small business premium totaling to 8,3 % in average. The

<<<

 risk is based on observations of sim ilar companies. The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on the following estimates: · Future sales are estimates based on budget and long term plans · Long-term average growth rate is

<<<

 set at 2,1%. · Today's co sta s a percentage of Income is considered to reflect future projections · For goodwill testing, management has used a 5 year period with a terminal value growth rate beyond this period of 2,1% in average. Terminal

<<<

 growth rate is set pr CGU. · Risk-free interest rate is based on the 10-year government bond yield · Beta Value is based on figures from international companies listed on the stock exchange

No Impairment of goodwill was necessary in 2015.

(Amounts in NOK l 000)
Financial risk The Group uses financial instruments such as

<<<

 bond loans. The purpose of these financial instruments is to raise capital for investments that are necessary for the Group's business. In addition, the Group has financial instruments such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, etc. which

<<<

 are directly related to its d aily operations. For commercial hedging purposes, the Group uses derivatives. The Group does not apply hedge accounting. The Group does not use financial Instruments, including derivatives, for revenue purposes

<<<

. Procedures for risk management are adopted by the Board. The main financial risks that the Group is exposed to are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and credit risk. The Group's management regularly evaluates these risks and

<<<

 establishes guidelines for how they are handled. The Group uses derivatives to hedge risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. In accordance with the Group's strategy for interest rate exposure, the Group uses derivatives to mitigate

<<<

 this risk. The accounting treatment of derivatives is explained in notex.
Credit risk The Group is m ainly exposed to credit risk for trade and other receivables. The Group mitigates its exposure to credit risk by ensuring that all parties

<<<

 requiring credit, such as customers, are approved and subject to a credit check. The Group does not have significant credit risk associated with a single counterparty or counterparties which can be viewed as a Group due to sim ilar credit risk

<<<

. The Group has policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers who have not had significant problems with payment and the outstanding amount does not exceed the established credit limits.
Maximum risk exposure is represented by

<<<

 the carrying amount of the financial assets in the balance sheet. The Group considers its maximum risk exposure to be the carrying amount of accounts receivable and accrued income (see note 10).
Market risk - interest rate sensitivity The Group

<<<

 is exposed to interest rate risk through its financial activities (see note 14). Part of the interest-bearing debt has floating rates, which means it is affected by changes in interest rates. The purpose of the Group's interest rate risk management

<<<

 is to reduce interest costs and at the same time keep the volatility of future interest payments within acceptable limits.

Based on the financial instruments that existed per 31 December 2015, an increase of 0.5% would reduce the Group's profit before tax by TNOK 750 (2013: TNOKO).

The average effective interest rate of financial instruments wereas follows

Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's strategy for managing liquidity risk is to m aintain sufficient

<<<

 liquid funds at all times to meet its financial obligations, both under normal and extraordinary circumstances, without risking unacceptable losses or damaging its reputation. The Group has large fluctuations related to restricted working capital

<<<

 due to seasonality and the timing of deliveries and payments.

Market risk - foreign currency sensitivity Exposures to currency exchange rates arise from the Group's overseas sales, which are prim arily denominated in SEK, DKK and PLN.
Furthermore

<<<

, the carrying amount of its net investments in foreign companies fluctuates in Norwegian kroner compared to the local relevant currencies. Profit after tax for the Group is also affected by changes in exchange rates, as the results of foreign

<<<

 companies are translated into Norwegian kroner at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The Group commercial hedges its foreign currency in the form of flexible forward contracts. Hedge accounting has not been applied. These contracts

<<<

 will take effect if the exchange rate fluctuates outside the strike rate and a maximum rate. The contracts are settled annually and if the contract goes over the period end, this is recognized in the financial statements at fair value. For

<<<

 2015, these contracts a mount to 0, and are therefore not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Determination of fair value The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts approximates fair value because

<<<

 these instruments havea short-term maturity date. Sim ilarly, the carrying amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value as the impact of discounting is not significant. The fair value of capital leases is calculated

<<<

 as the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the interest rate applicable for the corresponding assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of long-term debt is sim ilar to the par value plus accrued interest

<<<

.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using the forward exchange rate at the balance sheet date. For the derivative, the fair value is calculated by the financial institution that the company has entered into an agreement with

<<<

.
There are no material differences between the fair value and book value of the financial instruments in excess of liabilities to credit institutions where the book value is NOK 335.684 (current asset), while the fair value is NOK 335.684.

<<<


The fair value hierarchy The Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used In making the measurement. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: - Level 1: quoted

<<<

 prices (unadjusted) In active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie a s prices) or indirectly

<<<

 (ie derived from prices); and - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes 1 - Accounting Principles
General information
The North Alliance AS is a limited liability company incorporated

<<<

 and domiciled in Norway with offices at Kristian IV's gate 15 in Oslo.
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements for The North Alliance AS ("the company") are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS

<<<

) as adopted by the European Union and required for the financial year beginning 1 January 2015 or later, as well as Norwegian disclosure requirements pursuant to the Accounting Act per 31 December 2015. The explanations of the accounting principles

<<<

 for the Group also apply to The North Alliance AS, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in some cases cover The North Alliance AS . Ownership interests in subsidiaries are presented at cost.
The Financial Statements have been

<<<

 prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through equity or the statement of income.
The Financial Statements

<<<

 are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events under similar conditions.
The financial statements of the holding company The North Alliance AS cover all head office activities. Activities at head office include

<<<

 the Group's executive management and the corporate development, HR, accounting/finance, and risk management. The corporate function staff largely carries out assignments for the Group's other companies, and charges the companies for these services

<<<

. The Group Treasury acts as an internal bank and is responsible for the Group's external financing, management of the Group's liquid assets and overall management of the Group's currency and interest risks. Interest from the Group's internal

<<<

 bank and dividends and contributions to the Group from investments in subsidiaries are presented as finance items and specified in the income statement.
Classification
Assets and liabilities related to the normal operating cycle are classified

<<<

 as current assets and current liabilities. Receivables and liabilities not related to the normal operating cycle are classified as current if they are of a short-term nature, normally due within one year. Shares and other investments not intended

<<<

 for continued use or ownership are classified as current assets. Other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet

<<<

. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported in the income statement in the lines Financial income and Financial expenses respectively.
7

The North Alliance AS --2015 Annual Financial Statements
Shares in subsidiaries
Shares are measured

<<<

 at cost and impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The impairment is reversed if the basis for the write-down is no longer present. Group contributions received are included in financial income

<<<

 provided that the Group contribution received does not represent a repayment of capital invested. Group contributions that represent a repayment of capital invested are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of investments in subsidiaries

<<<

. Net Group contributions payable (gross Group contributions less the associated tax effect) are included in the cost of investments in subsidiaries. Dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are included in financial income.
Fixed

<<<

 assets
Fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortization and impairment. Fixed assets with limited economic lives are depreciated over the expected economic life. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying

<<<

 amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of net sales value and the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated. Impairment losses are reversed if the basis for the impairment is no longer

<<<

 present.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value including allowance for bad debt.
Taxes
Income taxes are calculated from the profit (loss) before tax and comprise taxes payable and the change in deferred taxes. Deferred

<<<

 tax assets and liabilities are calculated in accordance with the liability method without discounting and provided for all differences between the carrying amount in the balance sheet and the tax base of assets and liabilities, and for unused

<<<

 tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is expected that the benefit can be utilized through sufficient taxable profits from expected future earnings.
Revenue recognition
Operating revenues are recognized when the services

<<<

 are rendered.
Interest income
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted

<<<

 at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loan and receivables is recognized using the original effective interest rate.
Dividend distribution

<<<


Dividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognized as a liability in the group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company's shareholders.
8

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial

<<<

 Statements
Contingent liabilities and assets
Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements. In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable

<<<

 or remote, no liability is recognized. A contingent asset is not recognized in the financial statements but disclosed if it is probable that the benefit will flow to the Group.
Changes in accounting policies
New and amended standards adopted

<<<

 by the Group
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the requirements relating to the offset of financial assets and financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments clarify

<<<

 the meaning of "currently has legally enforceable right of set-off" and "simultaneous realization and settlement". The amendments have been applied retrospectively. As the Group does not have any financial assets and financial liabilities that

<<<

 qualify for offset, the application of the amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognized in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amounts Disclosures for Non-Financial

<<<

 Assets The amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of cash-generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives had been allocated when there has been no impairment or reversal

<<<

 of impairment of the related CGU. Furthermore, the amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements applicable to when the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is measured at fair value less costs of disposal. These new disclosures

<<<

 include fair value hierarchy, key assumptions and valuation techniques used which are in line with the disclosure required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements. The applications of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures

<<<

 in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Fledge Accounting The amendment considers legislative changes to 'over-the-counter' derivatives and the establishment of central

<<<

 counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets

<<<

 specified criteria. The Group has applied the amendment and there has been no significant impact on the Group consolidated financial statements as a result.
IFRIC21 Levies The interpretation sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay

<<<

 a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37 'Provisions'. The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognized. The amendments have been applied retrospectively

<<<

. The Group is not currently subjected to significant levies so the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements is not material.
Standards, amendments and interpretations of existing standards that have not come into force and where

<<<

 the Group has not chosen early implementation:
9

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January

<<<

 2015, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statement. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 Financial

<<<

 Instruments The standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the

<<<

 classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through OCI and fair value

<<<

 through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit

<<<

 or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities

<<<

 there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements

<<<

 for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ""hedged ratio"" to be the same as the one management actually use

<<<

 for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is

<<<

 permitted. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9's full impact.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements

<<<

 about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the

<<<

 use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 'Revenue' and IAS 11 'Construction contracts' and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017

<<<

 and earlier application is permitted. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
There are no other IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations that have not yet come into effect that are expected to have a significant impact on the Group's

<<<

 consolidated financial statements.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not vet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group
There are no other standards or interpretations that are not yet effective

<<<

 that are expected to have a significant impact on the Financial Statements.
10

The North Alliance AS - 2015 Annual Financial Statements Significant management judgment in applying accounting policies When preparing the Financial Statements

<<<

, management undertakes a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions about the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment

<<<

 to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The Group tests for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as necessary

<<<

, or at a minimum annually (note 5). The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is based on the valuein-use calculation. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 5).
