 PTE LTD CALLABLE BOND ISSUE 2008/2009

Oslo, 18 September 2009

Reference is made to the loan agreement for the "ISIN NO 001 043911.0 - FRN Bluestone Offshore Pte Ltd Callable Bond Issue 2008/2009" with ISIN NO 001 043911.0 dated 30 May 20

<<<

09 (the "Loan Agreement") and made between Bluestone Offshore Pte Ltd (the "Company") and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, acting as loan trustee (the "Trustee") for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders").

Unless the context requires otherwise, words

<<<

 and expressions defined or construed in the Loan Agreement which are not defined or construed in these summons shall bear the same meanings when used in these summons.

The information in this summons regarding the Company and market conditions

<<<

 is provided by the Company, and the Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.

In May 2008, the Company issued the Loan with the proceeds mainly to be used to convert the Bluestone Topaz ("Topaz") into

<<<

 a deepwater geotechnical vessel. At time of issuance of the Loan, the Company's current vessel, the Topaz, was expected to be generating cash flow for almost the whole of 2009. Due to the shortfall in revenues and unforeseen costs related to

<<<

 delays, maintenance and repair work on the Topaz, The Company has not been able to repay the Loan including accrued interest on the Maturity Date. Following a technical review, the Company has also concluded that it cannot guarantee the reliability

<<<

 and availability of the Topaz for the work that is contracted and that it will require significantly more investment to bring the vessel up to a reliable standard. The Company believes that the only viable option for the Company is to replace

<<<

 the Topaz with a newer and more reliable vessel.

The Company is an imminent need of new funding. Through a successful restructuring of the Loan, new equity injection and a new short-term bridge loan, the Company expects to establish a solid

<<<

 financial platform for continued operations both short-term and long-term. The Company has prepared a restructuring proposal for the Loan which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 (the "Term Sheet"). The Company has received the necessary pre commitments

<<<

 for the Bondholder meeting to vote in favour of the proposal. When the refinancing is committed by the lenders and subject to certain conditions as set out in the Term Sheet, GC Rieber Shipping will provide a bridge loan of up to approximately

<<<

 USD 3 million to keep the Company afloat until the new share issue can be completed and also contract in the New Vessel and manage the mobilisation.
For further information on the restructuring proposal for the Loan and the background and situation

<<<

 of the Company, please refer to the Term Sheet, the Company Update attached to the summons sent to Bondholders dated 21 August 2009 and the Company presentation that was distributed to the Bondholders on 10 September 2009.

THE PROPOSED

<<<

 REFINANCING

a)

On 31 August 2009 a Bondholders' meeting was held pursuant to the summons

dated 21 August 2009 regarding an extension of the term of the Loan. Pursuant

to such Bondholders' meeting, the Maturity Date of the Loan was postponed

<<<

 to

16 September 2009.

b)

The Loan and accrued interest have not been repaid on the Maturity Date, but

the Company has been negotiating for a refinancing of the Loan and certain

other debt, and have proposed a refinancing solution (the

<<<

 "Proposed

Refinancing") to the Bondholders as set out in the Term Sheet.

2

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

2.1 The Company's evaluation

The Company is in a difficult financial position and the value of the assets of the Company would only give

<<<

 the Bondholders a very limited repayment on their Bonds. The Proposed Refinancing will ensure the continued operations of the Company and will give the Bondholders a possibility to receive a payment of 60% of par value of their Bonds as full

<<<

 settlement of the Bonds and accrued interest if and when the derrick on the Vessel has been successfully moved to a new vessel to be used in the operations of the Company.

The Company is of the opinion that the Proposed Refinancing is progressing

<<<

 well and all parties involved seem to be committed to ensure a positive outcome, and the

_ NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
www. trustee, no
preparation for contracting and mobilisation of the New Vessel is moving along as expected.
2.2 The Trustee

<<<

's evaluation The Trustee is not in a position to make any recommendation with regard to the Proposed Refinancing, and the Proposed Refinancing is therefore put forward without any further evaluations or recommendation from the Trustee.
The

<<<

 Bondholders who have not provided Pre-Commitments must independently evaluate, based on available information, whether the Proposed Refinancing is acceptable. It is recommended that these Bondholders seek counsel from tax and other advisors

<<<

 regarding the effects and possible consequences of the Proposal.
