1 PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING
In the Bondholders' Meeting held on 5 August 2011 for the Secured Bonds and the Unsecured Bonds, the Secured Bondholders and the Unsecured Bondholders voted in favour of a proposal to, among other things, defer payments

<<<

 of interest and to introduce a stand-still period until 30 September 2011 in order to allow the Issuer to continue its operations in the short term while seeking to reach agreement with its major stakeholders on a long-term restructuring solution

<<<

 for its business. Today, 18 October 2011, the Issuer published an announcement setting out the main terms of a proposal for the acquisition by Teekay Corporation ("Teekay") of the Issuer's FPSOs and the restructuring of the Bonds and the Issuer

<<<

's share capital (the "Restructuring"). A copy of the Issuer's announcement has been attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
The key elements of the Restructuring comprise, inter alia:
(i) an acquisition of the Issuer's three FPSOs (the "FPSO Transactions

<<<

") for a total cash amount of USD 668 million, which shall be utilised to settle certain of the Issuer's external debt in full, including through the redemption of the Secured Bonds at less than par value, and the payment of fees due to the

<<<

 Bond Trustee's advisers and certain advisers to the Issuer in connection with the Restructuring (the "Advisory Fees");
(ii) funding by Teekay of the completion of the upgrade of the FPSO Voyageur (prior to Teekay's acquisition of that FPSO

<<<

) through a bridge loan to the Issuer;
(iii) full settlement of the Unsecured Bonds by transfer of the Issuer's 96,000,000 shares in Sevan Drilling ASA (the "Drilling Shares") to a company owned by the Unsecured Bondholders (the "Unsecured SPV

<<<

") and the issue to the Unsecured Bondholders of 10% of the pro forma share capital of the Issuer on a fully diluted basis following the Restructuring (the "Unsecured Equity") by way of a debt for equity conversion;
(iv) an increase of the Issuer

<<<

's equity by an amount of USD 50 million through a USD 25 million cash subscription of new shares by Teekay, giving Teekay an ownership of 40% of all outstanding shares in the Issuer after the Restructuring on a fully diluted basis (assuming

<<<

 full subscription), and a USD 25 million cash subscription for new shares by the shareholders and the Unsecured Bondholders as at a record date to be determined by the Issuer, giving the shareholders and the Unsecured Bondholders (in addition

<<<

 to the shares already owned by the shareholders and the Unsecured Equity to be issued to the Unsecured Bondholders in accordance with paragraph (iii) above) an ownership of 40% of all outstanding shares in the Issuer after the Restructuring

<<<

 on a fully diluted basis (assuming full subscription).
2

The Restructuring has received the support of the board of directors of the Issuer and more than 2/3 of the outstanding Bonds in each class of the Bonds, but the completion of the Restructuring

<<<

 remains subject to a number of conditions, as further set out in the Issuer's announcement.

2

INTRA-BONDHOLDERS ARRANGEMENTS

In order to achieve the requisite support from the Bondholders in all of the Bonds, an informal group of institutions

<<<

 that are understood to be the largest Bondholders across all classes of the Bonds (the "Restricted Bondholders") have separately negotiated and agreed on certain intra-bondholders arrangements (the "Intra-Bondholders Arrangements"). The key

<<<

 terms of the Intra-Bondholders Arrangements, which in more detail have been set out in a bondholder term sheet attached hereto as Exhibit 2 (the "Bondholder Term Sheet"), can be summarised as follows:

(a) If the completion of the acquisition

<<<

 by Teekay of the FPSO Piranema and the FPSO Hummingbird (the "First Completion") occurs, and the Drilling Shares have been sold during the period of 21 clear days following the extraordinary general meeting (the "EGM") of the Issuer's shareholders

<<<

 to be held to approve the various resolutions required to implement the Restructuring (the "Interim Completion Period") for a consideration of USD 75 million or more, then:

(i) the Secured Bondholders shall in aggregate contribute an amount

<<<

 of approximately USD 6.5 million for distribution to the Unsecured Bondholders, provided that such payment shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis, but not below zero, to the extent that the consideration received by the Unsecured SPV

<<<

 in connection with the sale of the Drilling Shares exceeds USD 75 million; and

(ii) if the Bond Trustee has, at any time prior to the date of the EGM, received an irrevocable notice in writing from Unsecured Bondholders holding more than 

<<<

50% of the outstanding Unsecured Bonds indicating that the Unsecured Bondholders wish to transfer all of the Unsecured Equity to the Secured Bondholders (an "Unsecured Equity Notice"), the Secured Bondholders shall acquire all of the Unsecured

<<<

 Equity from the Unsecured Bondholders in consideration for an aggregate cash payment of USD 6.25 million.

(b) If First Completion occurs and prior to or during the Interim Completion Period, the Drilling Shares have either not been sold or

<<<

 have been sold for less than USD 75 million, then:

(i) the Secured Bondholders shall in aggregate contribute an amount of approximately USD 18.2 million for distribution to the Unsecured Bondholders (subject to certain adjustments for the

<<<

 allocation of Advisory Fees as set out below), provided that such payment shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis, but not below zero, to the extent that the consideration received by the Unsecured Bondholders in connection with the sale

<<<

 of the Drilling Shares exceeds USD 63.3 million; and

(ii) if the Drilling Shares have been sold for at least USD 63.3 million but less than USD 75 million prior to or during the Interim Completion Period and the Bond Trustee has,

3

at any

<<<

 time prior to the date of the EGM, received an Unsecured Equity Notice, the Secured Bondholders shall acquire all of the Unsecured Equity from the Unsecured Bondholders in consideration for an aggregate cash payment of USD 6.25 million.
(c

<<<

) If First Completion occurs and prior to or during the Interim Completion Period, the Drilling Shares have not been sold, then in order to ensure that the Bridge Loan Bonds are either repaid in full or acquired by the Unsecured Bondholders

<<<

 (or the Underwriting Bondholders (as defined below)):
(i) an amount of approximately USD 10.5 million of the proceeds payable to the Unsecured Bondholders at the end of the Interim Completion Period will be applied as a partial repayment of

<<<

 the Bridge Loan Bonds held by Secured Bondholders;
(ii) the Secured Bondholders holding Bridge Loan Bonds have agreed to undertake to tender their Bridge Loan Bonds for sale to the Unsecured Bondholders and certain underwriting Bondholders

<<<

, who have agreed to provide an aggregate subscription commitment of USD 18 million (the "Underwriting Bondholders") at a purchase price equal to the outstanding indebtedness (including, without limitation, principal, call premium and accrued

<<<

 interest) under the Bridge Loan Bonds as at the date of settlement of the tender (the "Bridge Loan Bond Tender");
(iii) the Bridge Loan Bond Tender will be allocated amongst subscribing Bondholders (including the Underwriting Bondholders) on

<<<

 a pro rata basis (calculated by reference to their respective subscriptions for Bridge Loan Bonds against the aggregate amount of subscriptions received in the Bridge Loan Bond Tender), provided, however, that the allocation of Bridge Loan

<<<

 Bonds shall be adjusted to ensure that if a subscribing Bondholder has submitted a subscription for Bridge Loan Bonds at least equal to their pro rata percentage holding of Unsecured Bonds, such subscribing Bondholder shall not receive an allocation

<<<

 of Bridge Loan Bonds which is less than their pro rata percentage o f the Bridge Loan Bonds, calculated by reference to their holding of Unsecured Bonds; and
(iv) after completion of the Bridge Loan Bond Tender, the Unsecured Bondholders and

<<<

 the Underwriting Bondholders participating in the Bridge Loan Bond Tender shall be paid out of the proceeds payable to the Unsecured Bondholders, on a pro rata basis by reference to the amount of Bridge Loan Bonds acquired by them, an amount

<<<

 equal to USD 3.2 million plus an amount equal to the interest accrued on the Bridge Loan Bonds from 29 September 2011 until the completion of the Bridge Loan Bond Tender.
The Advisory Fees shall initially be borne by the Secured Bondholders

<<<

, but once the total gross recoveries of the Unsecured Bondholders have been ascertained (on the basis of whether or not (and at what price) the Drilling Shares have been sold prior to or during the Interim Completion Period), then the allocation

<<<

 of the Advisory Fees shall be recalculated by reference to the total gross recoveries of the Unsecured Bondholders measured against the total gross recoveries of all the Existing Bondholders.
4

Please note that any monies to be paid or securities

<<<

 to be received by any individual Bondholder in any of the classes of the Bonds in connection with the Restructuring shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the Bondholders in that class of Bonds by reference to each relevant Bondholder's holding

<<<

 of Bonds in that class of Bonds (based on the amount of principal, default premium and accrued interest not being overdue) and/or holding of claims for overdue interest in respect of such Bonds as at the relevant record date.
***
Further information

<<<

 about the resolutions that will be required from the Bondholders to implement the Restructuring and the Intra-Bondholders Arrangements will be provided in the summons for the Bondholders Meetings to be held in each of the Bonds, which summons

<<<

 will be distributed by no later than 21 October 2011.

 the same terms as Teekay in the Stakeholder Placement.

<<<

. The completion of the Teekay Placement will trigger a mandatory offer obligation for Teekay on the existing share capital of Sevan Marine. The Stakeholder Placement will be completed after expiry of the acceptance period for a mandatory offer

<<<

 launched by Teekay.
Further information related to the Placements will be published in due course. The Company will publish a prospectus in connection with the Placements which will be approved by the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority

<<<

 of such projects which will obligate Sevan Marine to offer any FPSO or other offshore projects and associated charter contracts to Teekay at fair market value. However, Sevan Marine will be free to offer such projects to third parties should

<<<

 Teekay decide not to accept the offer. The cooperation agreement will only relate to lease contracts. Sevan Marine will be free to enter into contracts relating to licensing of the Company's offshore unit design and technology.
Teekay and Sevan

<<<

 Marine will also enter into reciprocal service agreements for access to each other's resources related to engineering, project and technology development, assistance with redeployment and other FPSO-related work, subject to availability and

<<<

 a new "asset-light" structure with reduced capital requirements. Sevan Marine will be a substantially net debt free company consisting of: · two partially completed hulls (#4 and #5) currently located at the COSCO Shipyard in China (which will

<<<

 facility (of which USD 37.9 million principal amount is outstanding as at the date hereof), which is serviced in full by revenue earned under an existing licensing arrangement.
Together with Teekay, as a strong industrial partner, the Company

<<<

 will be well positioned to benefit from opportunities in a growing FPSO market. Going forward, Sevan Marine will focus on applying its engineering, project development, and marketing capabilities to develop new offshore projects, and developing

<<<

 opportunities to earn fees from licensing its intellectual property rights.

Teekay shall

<<<

 appoint two Directors to the Board of Directors of the Company.
Financial data in respect of the transactions: The assets being divested through the transactions have been part of the Floating Production reporting segment of Sevan Marine, but

<<<

 have not been subject to separate financial reporting. Pro forma financial data illustrating the effects of the restructuring will be provided in an information memorandum/prospectus prepared in accordance with applicable rules in conjunction

<<<

 with the restructuring and the Placements.
Off-balance sheet obligations relating to the divested business: As parent company of the Sevan Marine Group, Sevan Marine has guaranteed for correct fulfillment of various contracts entered into by

<<<

 its subsidiaries in respect of the FPSOs, including, but not limited to, charter contracts for the FPSOs, upgrade contracts for the Voyageur, loan agreements, performance guarantees towards technical managers of the units. The transactions

<<<

 contemplate that Sevan Marine will be released from such obligations as a result of the transactions.

<<<

 operation of the FPSOs as required by law or as further agreed.
