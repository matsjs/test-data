Dear Sirs,

12.00 per cent Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue

<<<

 2013/2018 - ISIN NO 001 0691116

We refer to the Bond Agreement for the abovementioned Bond Issue made between Norsk Tillitsmann ASA as Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders (the "Bond Agreement"). Capitalised terms used herein shatl have

<<<

 the same meaning as in this Bond Agreement.

We further refer to the letter from Norsk Tillitsmann ASA to us dated 18 February 2014. In this let ter we have been asked to provide information about certain events, and please note as follows

<<<

 in this respect:

(a)

The Parent has been contacted by, and conducted informal telephone conversations

and calls with, certain bondholders in a corporate bond issued by the Parent in the amount

ofUSD $335,000,000 with Citibank N.A., as trustee

<<<

 (the "Parent Bond"). The Parent is further

in the process of engaging a financial advisors for the restructuring of the Parent Bond.

Formal negotiations for rescheduling of indeptendness has not been initiated, and we do

not believe that

<<<

 the present contact between the Parent and certan bondholders in the

Parent Bond constitute an Event of Default under Clause 15.1 (e) (i) of the Bond Agree

ment.

(b)

An interest payment in the amount of USD$ 18,843,750 was due under the

<<<

 Parent

Bond on 15 January 2014 and the Parent failed to make the said interest payment on that

date and within the applicable remedy period. Certain commitments under existing credit

facilities of the Parent have also been suspended. No

<<<

 event of default has been declared

thereunder, but we appreciate that this qualify as an Event of Dealt under Clause 15.1 (c)

under the Bond Agreement if not remedied.

(c)

The Issuer intent to employ the Vessel on a new Charter Contract

<<<

 outside of Mexico

following completion of the present Charter Contract contract with Pemex on or about

april 14, 2014 We do accordingly not believe that it will be necessary to postpone the

next interest payment due in June 2014 under the

<<<

 Bond Agreement. We fail to see how it

at this stage could constitute an Event of Default under Clause 15.1 (e) (i) of the Bond

Agreement.

(d)

On February 11, 2014 the Minister of Public Function of Mexico issued a order prov

ing that the

<<<

 Federal Dependencies and Entities, the General Federal Attorney and Mexican

States must not accept or propose any contract with Oceanografia for a period of one

year, nine months

<<<

 12 days, The Parent intents to challenge this deception in appropriate Mexican courts, but this is likely to take some time. The Parent will immediately start to market its fleet for operations world wide,. It is accordingly too early to conclude

<<<

 that this event will cause a Material Adverse Change under Clause 15.1 (i) of the Bond Agree ment.

(e)

Please also be advised that the bareboat hire for the month of February was due on 1 Feb

ruary 2014, but has not been paid by the Parent

<<<

. This hire will be paid by the Parent with

in 20 days, and the Parent intent to pay the monthly bareboat hire until the Vessel is em

ployed on a new contract.

In respect of the unfortunate circumstances mentioned above, the Issuer and the

<<<

 Parent wilt engage Kennedy Marr to market Vessel for operations world wide - and are confident that a Charter Con tract will be secured in time and at rates in order to avoid any payment default under the Bond Agreement..

If the Issuer and

<<<

 the Parent are unable to obtain employment for the Vessel acceptable to the Bond Trustee before the next Payment Date, the Issuer is prepared to discuss other alternatives with the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders to secure the Bondholders

<<<

 rights.

At this stage, we kindly request that the Bond Trustee does not declare an Event of Default based on the circumstances mentioned in (a) through (e) above until after 1 april 2014.

We will in the period up to 1 april 2014 in consultation

<<<

 with yourselves and the Bondholders work out a restructuring plan, and on that basis make a new waiver request to be presented for approval by a Bondholders Meeting as appropriate.

Please confirm your agreement to this in a response to this

<<<

 letter.

We look forward to hearing from you in this respect.

Yours faithfully,
