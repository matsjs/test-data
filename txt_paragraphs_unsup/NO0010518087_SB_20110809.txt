(i) ISIN NO 001 051808.7, with current outstanding

 amount of NOK 20,165,048 (the "Second Priority II Bond Issue".
(ii) ISIN NO 001 059727.1 with current outstanding amount of NOK 53,000,000 (the "Second Priority I Bond Issue", and
(iii) ISIN NO 001 040401.5, with current outstanding amount

 of NOK 40,000,000 (the "Third Priority Bond Issue")
(each of (i) to (iii) a "Bond Issue" and the Second Priority I Bond Issue and the Second Priority II Bond Issue together the "Second Priority Bond Issues" ), where Krillsea Group AS (formerly

<<<

 Krill Seaproducts AS) (the "Issuer") is the issuer.
Unless otherwise defined herein, or the context otherwise requires, capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the respective loan agreements for the Bond Issues

<<<

 between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee (for and on behalf of the Bondholders in each Bond Issue) (each a "Loan Agreement" and together, the "Loan Agreements").
The information in this summons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status

<<<

 o f the Issuer is provided by the Issuer. The Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information givenfrom the Issuer.
1 BACKGROUND
The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee of the following:
Due to

<<<

 poor krill harvesting and technical difficulties reducing the operations of the vessel M/S Thorshovdi (the "Vessel"), the Issuer is once again facing a critical liquidity situation.
Despite the recent efforts to financially restructure the

<<<

 company the Issuer's operations do not generate cash flow sufficient to service the Issuer's obligations going forward, and continued operations are dependent on new funds being made available.

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
The existing shareholders have declined to contribute new funds, and the Issuer is currently engaged in discussions with Innovasjon

<<<

 Norge and Norsk Tillitsmann, representing the Issuer's major creditors, in order to resolve the situation. Assuming no new equity can be raised the solution is likely to entail a sale of the Issuer's assets and a distribution to creditors in

<<<

 order of priority.
In the ongoing discussions the major stakeholders have indicated to the Issuer that they would prefer to see a solution whereby a sale of the Issuer's assets and the winding-up of the company are controlled outside of bankruptcy

<<<

 in order to maximize recovery for creditors.
The Issuer is currently in the process of selling the Vessel, and has prepared for a due diligence investigation to be made followed by an indicative offering which is anticipated to be concluded

<<<

 on or about 15 August 2011. It is expected that a sale of the Vessel may be completed within 15 September 2011 (the "Sales Period"), although this is not certain.
A sale of the Vessel as a going concern is assumed to return the highest possible

<<<

 proceeds, and the transaction is likely to be completed in a time and cost efficient manner, without the procedural and commercial risks related to bankruptcy or a forced sale on assets. Consequently a voluntary sale of the Vessel and the Issuer

<<<

's assets is considered to be in the best interest of the Issuers secured and unsecured creditors.
As an initial step to facilitate the ongoing sales process, the Issuer and Norsk Tillitsmann have agreed that the Issuer may covers certain costs

<<<

 incurred in relation to its continued operations in the Sales Period by applying receivables and sales proceeds from the sale of stock included in the existing Loan Security for the Second Priority Bond Issues. This has been agreed on the condition

<<<

 that the Issuer will procure that any cash proceeds from the sale of the secured assets are placed in a bank account pledged on first priority in favour of the Bond Trustee, and any payments from the pledged account shall be subject to the

<<<

 written approval of the Bond Trustee.
As a further step to address the Issuer's short term liquidity situation and facilitate a solution whereby the Issuer arranges for a voluntary sale of the Vessel, the Issuer has filed a loan application

<<<

 for a short term loan from Innovasjon Norge in the nominal amount of up to NOK 12,000,000 plus interest and expenses, established on market terms, (the "Additional Loan"). The proceeds from the Additional Loan will, subject to the terms and

<<<

 conditions of the short term loan agreement expected to be entered into between the Issuer and Innovasjon Norge, be applied to cover all or parts of the Issuer's costs incurred in relation to the continued operations of the Issuer in the Sales

<<<

 Period. The Additional Loan will be secured on first priority ranking ahead of the Loan Security as defined in the Loan Agreements, and the Issuer requests the Bondholders in each of the Bonds to approve the increase of the better ranking loan

<<<

 obligations and the subordination of priority (as applicable) within the aggregate maximum amount of the Additional Loan.
The short term liquidity may also be provided from other sources than Innovasjon Norge, and the same priority and subordination

<<<

 issues will then apply, and such other financing may then also be covered by the definition of Additional Loan.
Furthermore, to facilitate the ongoing sales process, the Issuer has requested that the Bondholders in each of the Second Priority

<<<

 Bond Issues agree to a standstill in the Sales Period, and agree that the Issuer covers costs incurred in relation to its continued operations in the Sales Period by applying receivables and sales proceeds from the sale of stock, included by

<<<

 the existing Loan Security for the Second Priority Bond Issues.
The effect of the proposed standstill is that Norsk Tillitsmann (on behalf of the bondholders) will, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the proposal below, be unable

<<<

 to exercise any default or terminations rights or enforce the Loan Security, including the pledge of trade receivables and the pledge over inventory/stock, during the Sales Period. The Issuer will, however, procure that any cash proceeds from

<<<

 the sale of the secured assets are placed in a bank account pledged on first priority in favour of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders in the Second Priority Bond Issues), and any payments from the pledged account shall be subject

<<<

 to the written approval of the Bond Trustee.

(B) The Bondholders in the Second Priority

<<<

<<<

 any enforcement or similar action against the Issuer or any of its assets, pursuant to or in connection with any of the Loan Agreements; provided however that the foregoing shall not apply, and the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the respective

<<<

 Bondholders) shall be at liberty to exercise any and all rights afforded under any Loan Agreements (and the Sales Period for the purposes of this summons shall end) in the event that
(i) a request with a competent court for the opening of insolvency

<<<

 proceedings in the Issuer is filed and sustained; or
(ii) any holder of a secured claim against the Issuer notifies the Issuer that an event of default has occurred which is continuing and has not been remedied within the applicable remedy
