All capitalized terms used

<<<

 and not otherwise defined herein (including any attachment hereto) shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Bond Loan dated 8 September 2010 (as amended) (the "Bond Agreement").

The information in this summons

1.

BACKGROUND

1.1 Intra group restructuring

To create a more flexible holding structure

<<<

 for Interoil's activities in Columbia and Peru, Interoil is in the process of carrying out an intra-group restructuring (the "Restructuring"). The proposal described in this Summons is a result of an internal review process since completion

<<<

 of the private placement in March 2013, with the aim of optimising the group structure.

Under the old group structure, Interoil Exploration & Production Latin America AS ("LATAM") has been the holding company for the activities in both Columbia

<<<

 and Peru.

Under the new group structure, Interoil Peru Holding AS ("IPH") is incorporated as a 100 % owned subsidiary of Interoil and holding company for the shares in Interoil Peru S.A. (Peru) ("IOP") and North Oil Services S.A.C. (Peru)

<<<

 ("NOSP") (the two latter jointly the "Peruvian Companies").
LATAM will continue to be the holding company for the activities in Columbia through Interoil Columbia Exploration & Production Inc. (British Virgin Island).

 in relation to the Proposal, without any obligation to notify the Bondholders as provided fo r in Clause 16.2 o f the Bond Agreement. Further, the Bond Trustee is given power o f attorney to enter into the necessary agreements in connection

 the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 1/2 o f the voting Bonds must be represented

<<<

 at the meetings.
Attached hereto is a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at

<<<

 the Bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account

<<<

 number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond

<<<

 Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page o f this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred

<<<

 to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the

<<<

 Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (as set out at the first page of

<<<

 this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
