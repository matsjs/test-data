Dear Bondholders:
As you heard from Nordic Trustee, the Company did not make an interest payment that was scheduled to be paid on September 30, 2015. We wanted to give you some background on

<<<

 the Company's decision, as well as an update on our discussions with Pemex regarding the execution of a potential contract for the Impetus.
Like every business in our industry, Oro Negro is facing significant challenges. Our challenges are

<<<

 a direct result of the challenges our only customer, Pemex, also faces. We continue to partner with Pemex to address the collective issues we face, but these challenges directly and negatively impacted our liquidity, which remains extremely

<<<

 limited. As a result, the Company must continue to make difficult choices on the timing for paying its commercial and financial obligations, while simultaneously ensuring that our rigs are operating safely and consistent with the expectations

<<<

 o f Pemex. Guided by this goal, we made the decision to protect our collective investment in the rigs, including the Impetus. To be clear, the Company has invested approximately US$76 million in the Impetus to date and its budget includes funding

<<<

 approximately additional $3 million for the costs of maintaining the current state of the Impetus and getting it ready for operations through the end o f the year, even though the asset has not generated any revenue yet.
We continue to believe

<<<

 the best path to maximize the value of our collective investment in the Impetus is to secure a contract with Pemex. We are in active discussions with Pemex on the timing and content o f the contract. Pemex continues to tell us that the contract

<<<

 timing is scheduled between November and early December. We are pleased with the progress to date, and are working closely with Pemex to secure the contract as soon as possible. Any other course of action would, in our opinion, significantly

<<<

 reduce the value o f the rig, and materially jeopardize the likelihood of securing the contract.
We appreciate the opportunity to discuss these important issues with you. We are available if you have any questions.
Very tru|v vnnrc
Integradora
