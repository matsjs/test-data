About this document
This drawdown prospectus (including

<<<

 the information incorporated by reference herein) constitutes a prospectus (the "Drawdown Prospectus") in respect o f the Notes and has been prepared in accordance with the Prospectus Rules of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority

<<<

. This Drawdown Prospectus comprises a prospectus for the purposes of Article 5.3 of the Directive 2003/71/EC, as amended, to the extent that such amendments have been implemented in the relevant Member State of the European Economic Area (the

<<<

 "Prospectus Directive") and for the purpose of giving information with regard to the Issuer which, according to the particular nature o f the Notes is necessary to enable investors to make an informed assessment of the assets and liabilities

<<<

, financial position, profit and losses and prospects o f the Issuer. Application will be made for the Drawdown Prospectus to be passported to Sweden and for the Notes to be listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm AB, the regulated market of Nasdaq Stockholm

<<<

. The Notes will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of IPF Holdings Limited, International Personal Finance Investments Limited, IPF International Limited and MCB Finance Group Limited (each a

<<<

 "Guarantor", together the "Guarantors" and their respective guarantee in respect o f the Notes, the "G uarantee"). "unconditionally" means that, if the Issuer hasn't paid the relevant amount due, there is no further condition to be fulfilled

<<<

 before the Guarantee can be called on, and "irrevocably" means that the Guarantors can't revoke their Guarantee at a later date. The reference to "on a joint and several basis" means that any person owed money under the Guarantee may pursue

<<<

 the obligation against all the Guarantors together, or any one Guarantor as if that Guarantor were liable for the whole guaranteed amount. The Issuer and its subsidiaries (including the Guarantors) taken as a whole are referred to in this Drawdown

<<<

 Prospectus as the "Group".
This Drawdown Prospectus also describes the risks relevant to IPF and its business and risks relating to an investment in the Notes generally. An Investor should read and understand fully the

contents of this Drawdown

<<<

 Prospectus before making any investment decisions relating to the Notes.
Prospective investors in the Notes should ensure that they understand the nature of the Notes and the extent of their exposure to risks and that they consider the suitability

<<<

 of the Notes as an investment in the light o f their own circumstances and financial condition.
It is the responsibility of prospective investors to ensure that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and professional advice to make their

<<<

 own legal, financial, tax, accounting and other business evaluation of the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and are not relying on the advice of the Arranger, the Trustee or the Dealer in that regard.
Important - EEA Retail Investors

<<<


The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). For these purposes, a retail investor means

<<<

 a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) o f Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU ("MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC ("Insurance Mediation Directive"), where that customer

<<<

 would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) o f MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the "Prospectus Directive"). Consequently no key information

<<<

 document required by Regulation (EU) No. 128612014 (the "PRIIPS Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or

<<<

 otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.
MiFID II product governance/target market
Solely for the purposes o f the m anufacturer's product approval process, the target market

<<<

 assessment in respect o f the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution o f the Notes

<<<

 to

2

eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration the m anufacturers target market assessment; however

<<<

, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer`s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution

<<<

 channels.
Responsibility for the information contained in this Drawdown Prospectus
The Issuer and the Guarantors accept responsibility for the information contained in this Drawdown Prospectus. To the best o f the knowledge of the Issuer and

<<<

 the Guarantors (each having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this Drawdown Prospectus is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information

<<<

.
Where information has been sourced from a third party, this information has been accurately reproduced and, as far as the Issuer is aware and is able to ascertain from the information published by that third party, no facts have been omitted

<<<

 which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. The source o f third party information is identified where used.
Credit Rating Agency Regulation notice
The Issuer has been given a long-term issuer default rating of BB

<<<

 and a short-term issuer default rating of B by Fitch Ratings Ltd. Fitch Ratings Ltd is established in the EU and is registered as a credit rating agency under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (the "CRA R e g u la tio n " ).
A security rating is

<<<

 not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
"BB" ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to default risk, particularly in the

<<<

 event o f adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists which supports the servicing of financial commitments. The modifier "+" is appended to a rating to denote relative status

<<<

 within the major rating category.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the "Benchmark Regulation") Amounts payable under the Notes

<<<

<<<

 on 30 June 2016 have until by 1 January 2020 to apply for authorisation or registration in accordance with Article 34 (Authorisation and registration of an administrator) of the Benchmark Regulation and may continue to provide such an existing

<<<

 benchmark until 1 January 2020 or, where the index provider submits an application for authorisation or registration, unless and until such authorisation or registration is refused. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalised terms used in

<<<

 this Drawdown Prospectus have the meanings set out in the terms and conditions of the Notes set out in the Base Prospectus, as amended by this Drawdown Prospectus.

 changes in political, economic, and financial market conditions, such as a global or local recession, inflation and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. Change to the political landscape in one of the Group's geographic markets

 could undermine general demand for loans, lead to labour unrest, or, if capital controls are imposed, restrict the ability of a Group subsidiary to remit funds to the United Kingdom holding company. A recession could reduce demand for the Group

 lead to higher costs of Group borrowing, reducing profitability. The Group reports results in sterling, but the majority of its assets are denominated in foreign currencies, so exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the Group's income

 are emerging economies and so are subject to greater volatility in economic, political and financial market conditions. Changes in the economic and political climate both globally and locally, as well as changes in market conditions generally

<<<

 could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition.
· The proposed withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union ("B re x it") may bring potential economic and political uncertainty

<<<

 for the United Kingdom and European Union member states. Initial market reaction to the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has resulted in volatility in currency and equity markets, and a reassessment of the United Kingdom

<<<

 Sovereign's credit worthiness by the major external rating agencies. The United Kingdom government served a notice under Article 50 of The European Union Lisbon Treaty on 29 March 2017 of the intention to withdraw from the European Union, thus

<<<

 triggering the two-year period for withdrawal. Negotiations have begun to determine future relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union, particularly in terms of commercial, financial and legal agreements. The nature, timetable

<<<

 as well as the economic and political impacts of a potential Brexit are still highly uncertain and will depend on the outcome of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. However, a prolonged lack of clarity on the

<<<

 details of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and uncertainty over trade arrangements, market access and legislative and regulatory frameworks has resulted in continued market volatility on the European markets, and more broadly

<<<

 on the global economic and financial markets, and may continue to do so, potentially harming the credit rating, activity, results and financial position of the Group.
· The Group is at risk from regulation and litigation (including the effects

<<<

 of changes in law or interpretation of the law in the Group's operating markets) associated with the fact that the Group operates in a highly regulated industry. Any change such as the introduction of statutory caps on loans charges, could

<<<

 affect the Group's profitability, solvency and capital requirements and may give rise to increased costs of compliance. Litigation on the basis that the G roup's charges are unfair or usurious could compel a change in the Group's business model

<<<

.
· There could be challenges to the tax treatment of certain transactions and arrangements between the companies in the Group. Although the Group is headed by a United Kingdom holding company, the Group does not have substantial operations

<<<

 in the United Kingdom. This exposes the Group to the United Kingdom's international tax regime. The treatment of such international groups under United Kingdom tax law may be subject to significant change. Changes in accounting rules could

<<<

 also significantly impact the Group's tax liabilities. Changes in tax or accounting rules could damage the Group's financial position.
· The Group sees less clarity in tax legislation in its overseas markets than in the United Kingdom, and

<<<

 some uncertainty generally arising from the fact that court decisions are often not binding as precedents. In the overseas markets in which the Group operates, certainty of tax treatment may be obtained only once the operation has been subject

<<<

 to tax audit and these take place irregularly, typically on an annual basis. A home credit business has a number of unusual features which may make it unclear how overseas tax authorities will tax certain aspects of the operations. Adverse

<<<

 changes in, or conflicting interpretations of, tax legislation and practice in the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates may lead to an increase in the Group's taxation liabilities and effective tax rate.
· Risks arise from the

<<<

 implementation of the business strategy of the Group, both in respect o f existing markets and new markets. In particular, the Group's focus on the provision of home credit increases the Group's exposure to competitive and regulatory threats

<<<

. The
28

Group may misjudge its entry into a new geographic market, potentially leading to a loss during its time in, and on withdrawal from, the market.
· Loss may arise from the failure to ensure employee and agent safety, which could lead

<<<

 to agents or managers being harder to retain or being unwilling to make home visits, as well as personal injury claims and reputational damage, and the loss of key people, which could disrupt the Group's business.
· The Group is at risk of

<<<

 losses or liabilities incurred as a result o f the business failure o f a counterparty (for example, major IT suppliers, funding banks and retail banking facilities). Failure o f an IT services outsourcer could significantly disrupt the business

<<<

 operation, and failure of a bank with which the Group has a cash balance on account could lead to loss of the deposit or lack of sufficient cash to fund short term business operations in the market where such bank is based.
· There is a risk

<<<

 o f damage to the Group's brands or reputation or a decline in customer confidence in the Group or its products. Adverse publicity could affect customer willingness to take Group products or make repayments, or make it more difficult for the

<<<

 Group to recruit. Unfavourable publicity could in turn lead to increased pressure for changes to regulation of the consumer credit industry in the relevant market.

D.3

Key

Summary o f general risks affecting the Notes:

Information on the

<<<

 Key Risks which are specific to the Securities:

· The Notes are not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the "FSCS") or any equivalent scheme in another jurisdiction. As a result, neither the FSCS nor anyone else will pay

<<<

 compensation to Investors upon the failure of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Group as a whole.

· The Issuer may be expected to redeem Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an Investor

<<<

 generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an interest rate as high as that on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate.

· Investors who hold through CREST through the issuance

<<<

 of CDIs ("CDI H o ld e rs ") hold or have an interest in a separate legal instrument and will have only indirect interests in the underlying Notes. This could potentially lead to the CDI Holders having different rights and returns in respect

<<<

 o f such underlying Notes as against those Investors who have a direct interest in their Notes.

· Defined majorities may be permitted to bind all Noteholders with respect to modification and waivers of the Conditions of the Notes, even if

<<<

 some Noteholders did not attend or vote.

· Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop, or may develop and be illiquid. Investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide

<<<

 them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market.

· In respect of Notes tradable on the ORB, a market-maker may not continue to act as a market-maker for the life of the relevant Notes and a replacement

<<<

 market-maker may not be appointed, impacting the ability to sell the relevant Notes.

Summary o f issue specific risks affecting the Notes:

· An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of Notes. During any period when

<<<

 the Issuer may elect to redeem Notes, the market value of those Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.

· The market values of securities

<<<

 issued at a substantial discount or premium to their nominal amount tend to fluctuate more in relation to general changes in interest rates than do prices for conventional interest-bearing securities. Generally, the longer the remaining term

<<<

 of the securities, the greater the price volatility as compared to conventional interest-bearing securities with comparable maturities.

29

· The indication of yield stated within the Final Terms of the Notes applies only to investments made

<<<

 at the issue price of the Notes. If an Investor invests in Notes issued under the Programme at a price other than the issue price o f the Notes, the yield on that particular Investor's investment in the Notes will be different from the indication

<<<

 of yield on the Notes as set out in the Final Terms of the Notes.

GENERAL INFORMATION
(1) Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm AB, the regulated market of Nasdaq Stockholm. Nasdaq Stockholm AB is a regulated market for the purpose of

<<<

 Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and o f the Council on markets in financial instruments, including under any applicable implementing measure in each relevant jurisdiction ("MiFID").
(2) The Issuer and the Guarantors have obtained

<<<

 all necessary consents, approvals and authorisations in the United Kingdom in connection with the establishment of the Programme. The establishment and update of the Programme was authorised by resolutions of the Board of IPF passed on 12 March

<<<

 2010 and 22 February 2018, respectively and by the Executive Committee of IPF on 19 April 2010 and 19 April 2018, respectively. The issue and performance of Notes was authorised by resolutions of the Executive Committee of IPF on or about the

<<<

 date of this Drawdown Prospectus.
(3) There has been no significant change in the financial or trading position of the Issuer, any of the Guarantors or of the Group and no material adverse change in the prospects of the Issuer, any of the Guarantors

<<<

 or o f the Group since 31 December 2017.
(4) Save as disclosed below, there have been no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened) of which the Issuer is aware during the

<<<

 12 months preceding the date of this Drawdown Prospectus, which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on the Issuer and/or the Guarantors and/or the Group's financial position or profitability.
(a) On 24 December 20

<<<

13 the Group announced that Provident Polska had received a notice from the Office, stating that the way Provident Polska calculates APR amounts to an infringement o f consumer interests and subjected it to a fine of 12.4 million Polish Zloty

<<<

 (approximately £2.4 million). The Office believes that the fee for the optional home collection service and an associated preparatory fee should be included in the total cost o f credit and, therefore, the APR figure. The Group disagrees with

<<<

 the Office's decision and has a legal opinion supporting the view that the way the fees are currently calculated is correct. The Group submitted its appeal and entered into further discussion with the Office following changes in its product

<<<

 structure to be compliant with the new legislation that came into force in March 2016 (referred at Section 2 "Risk Factors The Group is, and in the future may be, subject to regulatory and legal actions or intervention in the ordinary course

<<<

 of its business" of the Base Prospectus). Following various interlocutory hearings a verdict was issued by the court of first instance in November 2017 a significantly reduced fine. The ruling has been appealed and a hearing date for the appeal

<<<

 remains pending.
(b) In early 2017, the home credit company in Poland, Provident Polska, appealed decisions received from the Polish Tax Chamber (the upper tier of the Polish tax authority) with respect to its 2008 and 2009 financial years

<<<

. The decisions for both years are the same and involve a transfer pricing challenge relating to an intra-group arrangement with a United Kingdom entity together with a challenge to the timing of taxation o f home collection fee revenues. As

<<<

 stated in the announcement at the time of the 2008 decision (issued on 6 January 2017), the Group disagrees with the interpretation of the tax authority and will defend its position robustly. In that announcement the Group also stated its intention

<<<

 to initiate a process with the UK tax authority aimed at ensuring that the intra-group transaction is not subject to double taxation but is taxed in accordance with international tax principles. This process involves a negotiation between the

<<<

 UK and Polish tax authorities to determine the correct pricing of the intra-group transaction. The process was initiated during 2017 and in response the Polish court has stayed the hearings of the 2008 and 2009 appeals pending resolution of

<<<

 this process. In order to make the appeals, the Group paid the amounts assessed which total £37 million comprising tax and associated interest. The 2010 and 2011 financial years are currently being audited by the tax authorities in Poland.

<<<

 In the event that the Polish tax authorities were to issue decisions following the
31

same reasoning as the decisions for 2008 and 2009, a further payment of approximately £44 million would become payable. All subsequent financial years remain

<<<

 open to future audit.
(c) In December 2015, an amendment to the Civil Code in Slovakia came into law which prohibits separate contracts for `ancillary' services linked to the provision of consumer credit. The home collection service in Slovakia

<<<

 fell into this category. In addition, all costs associated with a loan, whether mandatory or not, must now fall within the existing remuneration cap which is currently approximately 26.5% per annum of issue value for loans greater than one

<<<

 year and 37% for shorter durations. As a result, the Group took the decision to suspend the issuing of new loans in Slovakia from 18 December 2015 and the Slovak subsidiary is now in formal liquidation. The Group has since run-off the agent

<<<

-delivered home credit operations in Slovakia. In December 2016, the National Bank of Slovakia notified the Group's Slovak subsidiary of the commencement of official proceedings against it with respect to the exclusion of fees relating to its

<<<

 home collection service from the APR and remuneration cap (as outlined above). The Group submitted a response on 29 February 2017 but received an unfavourable decision in August 2017. The Group intends to appeal this decision and believes it

<<<

 has a strong defence based on a legal opinion and previous court decisions. If the National Bank's decision is confirmed a fine of Euro 90,000 will be payable and the decision that home collection fees should have been included in the APR calculation

<<<

 could be used by the court in hearings of claims brought by customers and could increase the number of customer claims initiated.
(5) Amounts payable under the Notes may be calculated by reference to STIBOR which is provided by the Swedish

<<<

 Bankers' Association (the "S B A "). As at the date of this Drawdown Prospectus, the SBA does not appear on the register of administrators and benchmarks established and maintained by the European Securities and Markets Authority pursuant to

<<<

 Article 36 of the Benchmark Regulation.
(6) IPF and Provident Financial plc ("P ro vid e n t F in a n cia l") entered into a demerger agreement on 25 June 2007 to effect the demerger of IPF from the Provident Financial group and govern the

<<<

 relationship between their respective groups following the demerger. Pursuant to the demerger agreement, IPF became the owner o f the entire issued share capital of Provident International Holdings Limited (which was the then holding company

<<<

 o f Provident Financial's international division) and, thereby, its operating subsidiaries. The dem erger agreement contains mutual indemnities under which IPF indemnifies the Provident Financial group against certain tax liabilities and liabilities

<<<

 arising in respect o f the IPF business and Provident Financial similarly indemnifies the Group against certain tax liabilities and liabilities arising in respect of the businesses carried on by the Provident Financial group. These mutual indemnities

<<<

 are unlimited in terms of amount or duration and are customary for an agreement of this type.
(7) Save as disclosed above, there are no material contracts entered into other than in the ordinary course o f the Issuer's or any of the Guarantors

<<<

' business, which could result in any member of the Issuer's Group being under an obligation or entitlement that is material to the Issuer's ability to meet its obligations to Noteholders in respect of the Notes being issued.
(8) Each Bearer

<<<

 Note having a maturity of more than one year and any Coupon and Talon with respect to such a Bearer Note will bear the following legend: "Any United States person who holds this obligation will be subject to limitations under the United States

<<<

(9) The Notes have been accepted for clearance through the Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg systems (which are the entities

<<<

 in charge o f keeping the records). Interests in the Notes may also be held through the issuance o f CDIs representing the underlying Notes. The Common Code, the ISIN and (where applicable) the identification number for any other relevant clearing

<<<

 system for each Series o f Notes will be set out in the Final Terms.
32

<<<
