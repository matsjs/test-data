 Oro Negro, S. de R.L. de C.V. (together with Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and its subsidiaries, the "Company"), are currently negotiating with Petroleos Mexicanos ("Pemex") certain adjustments to the current

<<<

 Mexican Drilling Contracts with respect to the Rigs. As a result of such adjustments, the Company expects lower revenues and projects significantly depressed cash flows in the near- to medium-term. The Company is in discussions with an ad hoc

<<<

 committee of Bondholders (the "Ad Hoc Bondholder Committee") with regards to certain modifications to the Bond Agreement to address the modifications to the said Mexican Drilling Contracts with Pemex and medium-term operational liquidity requirements

<<<

. As the Company's working capital is constrained, the Company will need an extension of the current liquidity access provisions in order to continue operations while it concludes the negotiations with the Ad Hoc Bondholder Committee. The Proposal

 (as defined below) is intended to address the short-term operational liquidity requirements up until 20 October 2016.

This summons is issued, inter alia, in order to seek approval from the Bondholders to extend the period related to the Interim

<<<

 Budget Period and waive temporarily the requirement to make deposits into the Issuer Debt Service Account, as further set out below.
