<<<

 Krill Seaproducts AS) (the "Issuer") is the issuer.
Unless otherwise defined herein, or the context otherwise requires, capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the respective loan agreements for the Bond Issues

<<<

 between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee (for and on behalf of the Bondholders in each Bond Issue) (each a "Loan Agreement" and together, the "Loan Agreements").
1. Sale of Vessel
Reference is made to the Bondholders meeting 16 September 20

<<<

11, where the Bondholders rejected an offer to sell the vessel M/S Thorshovdi (the "Vessel") for NOK 130 000 000 to Aker BioMarine Antarctic II AS ("ABMA").
No other buyer for the Vessel has materialized, and a group of Bondholders, representing

<<<

 more than 2/3 of the Bonds in each of the Bond Issues, have accepted a sale of the Vessel to ABMA on the terms that NOK 20 million (the "Sale Proceeds") will be distributed to the Bondholders. In addition, ABMA will pay an amount of NOK 44

<<<

2,129.33 as partly repayment of funding extended by Bondholders, see item 2 below. The mortgages over the Vessel in favour of the Bondholders are to be discharged accordingly.
The sale has been completed, but, for the sake of order, the acceptance

<<<

 of the sale will formally be reconfirmed at this Bondholders' meeting.

2. Bondholder

<<<

 Funding
A funding arrangement, accepted by a group of Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Bonds in each of the Bond Issues, has been established by the Bondholders in the Second Priority Bond I Issue, whereas an amount up to NOK 

<<<

3 mill of the proceeds from the first priority inventory claim has been placed as disposal for expenses necessary to, inter alia, keep minimum administration of the Issuer. This funding shall be repaid with 150 % from the Sale Proceeds.
For

<<<

 the sake of good order, the terms of the funding will formally be reconfirmed at this Bondholders' meeting.
3. Allocation
A group of Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Bonds in each of the Bond Issues have furthermore accepted a

<<<

 pro rata distribution with 85 % of the remaining net proceeds of the Sale Proceeds to the Second Priority Bond Issues, and the rest of the net Sale Proceeds (15 %) to the Third Priority Bond Issue.
For the sake of good order, the allocation

<<<

 will formally be reconfirmed at this Bondholders' meeting
The Bondholders in the Second Priority I Bond may in addition receive proceeds from sale of inventory included in the existing Loan Security for this Bond.
4. Enforcement and stand still

<<<


In order to establish a basis for receiving the Sale Proceeds, all the Bond Issues have been declared in default and accelerated. However, in order to avoid bankruptcy proceedings in the Issuer, a standstill has been given related to further

<<<

 enforcement, except regarding the claim over the inventory and receivables for the Second Priority I Bond Issue, see also item 5 below.
5. Proceeds
The proceeds to the Bondholder will be paid out when the calculation is finalized, whereafter

<<<

 all the Bond Issues will receive their pro rata share of the Sale Proceeds, less cost.
The proceeds from the claim over the inventory and receivables, established for the Second Priority I Bond Issue, will be paid out when all the revenues

<<<

 of the proceeds have been received, less cost. A partial payment may be carried out if any disputes etc. arise which may postpone finalization of the sale of the inventory. The claim over the inventory and receivables may be discharged when

<<<

 all inventories are sold.
An amount may be held back from the proceeds by the Bond Trustee in order to meet potential future cost.
6. Write down of claims
When the Vessel is sold, and the claim over the inventory and receivables is enforced

<<<

, the Issuer may have no more value, and no further proceeds may be expected for the Bondholders. In order to avoid bankruptcy proceedings, a controlled winding-up of the Issuer may take place; alternatively, this process may formally be accomplished

<<<

 by a sale of the Issuer. In case of a voluntary winding upsituation, it may be necessary for the Bondholders to accept a write-down of the remaining Bond claims against the Issuer. It is proposed that the Bond Trustee should, in cooperation

<<<

 with major Bondholders, be given the authority to make such write down, without further approval from the Bondholders' meeting.
