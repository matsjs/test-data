If the Shares are split into more than one class of shares, the Share Settlement Right shall be adjusted

 so that Bondholders' interest in the separate share classes remains unchanged, regardless of whether the Issuer elects to exercise its Share Settlement Option prior to, or after the date on which the Shares are quoted post-split.

 which are unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to the shareholders, the Bond Trustee and the Issuer shall agree on a new Share Settlement Price. This also applies to other transactions, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders compared

The Share Settlement Price shall not in any event be reduced to below the nominal value of the Shares

 and the Issuer undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Share Settlement Price to below such nominal value.
Without prejudice to Clause 12.

 of the Share Settlement Price requires a conversion to NOK, the exchange rate shall be the Prevailing Rate on the date triggering such

 of Shares in issue immediately before

such consolidation or subdivision, as the case may be; and

 of profits or reserves (including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) other than (i) where any such Shares are issued instead of the whole or part of a Dividend in cash which the shareholders would or could otherwise have

 received or (ii) where the shareholders may elect to receive a Dividend in cash in lieu of such Shares, the Share Settlement Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Share Settlement Price in force immediately prior to such issue by the following

 fraction:

is the aggregate nominal amount of the Shares in issue

immediately after such issue.

of the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer, by the number of

 "Dividend" and in the definition of "Fair Market Value") be determined as at the first date on which the Shares are traded ex- the relevant Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange, and in the case of a Non-Cash Dividend, the Fair Market Value

 of the relevant Dividend shall be the Fair Market Value of the relevant Spin-Off Securities or, as the case may be, the relevant property or assets.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, where the events or circumstances giving rise to

 any adjustment pursuant to this Clause 13 have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the Share Settlement Price or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other events or circumstances

 which have already given or will give rise to an adjustment to the Share Settlement Price or where more than one event which gives rise to an adjustment to the Share Settlement Price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion

 Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended result.

13.7

On any adjustment

<<<

, the resultant Share Settlement Price, if not in an integral multiple of NOK 0.0001, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of NOK 0.0001. No adjustment shall be made to the Share Settlement Price where such adjustment (rounded

 down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. (1%) of the Share Settlement Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the Share Settlement Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward

<<<

 and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time.

13.8

Notice of any adjustments to the Share Settlement

 Price shall be given by the Issuer to Bondholders and the Bond Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.

13.9

If changes are made in the share capital other than those mentioned above, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders compared

 to the shareholders, the Bond Trustee and the Issuer shall agree on a new Share Settlement Price. This also applies to other transactions, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders.
