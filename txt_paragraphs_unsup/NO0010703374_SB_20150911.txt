 Holding Corp. Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2014/2016

Oslo, 11 September 2015

SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - REQUEST FOR WAIVER FROM OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS AND TO FUND THE INTEREST RESERVE ACCOUNT
Nordic Trustee ASA

<<<

 (the "Bond Trustee") is appointed as bond trustee for the bond issue with ISIN NO 001 070337.4 (the "Bonds") issued by Metro Exploration Holding Corp. (the "Issuer" or "Metro Ex") pursuant to the terms of the bond agreement (the "Bond Agreement

<<<

") dated 13 February 2014 between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee.
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement unless otherwise stated.
The purpose of this summons is for the Issuer to present

<<<

 to the Bondholders a proposal for waivers in respect of:
(i) the Issuer's obligation (the "Interest Payment Requirement") under clause 9 o f the Bond Agreement to make Interest Payments from (and including) the August 2015 Interest Payment

<<<

 Date onwards (the "Interest Payment Waiver"); and
(ii) the Issuer's obligation (the "IRA Funding Requirement") to fund the Interest Reserve Account as required by clause 13.3.15 (ii) of the Bond Agreement (so as to ensure that there are sufficient

<<<

 funds in the Interest Reserve Account to pay two Interest Payments) (together with the Interest Payment Waiver, the "Waivers").
1. Background
The Issuer's business has faced the same challenges as the oil and oil services industry in general

<<<

, and the drilling segment in particular, due to the recent fall in oil prices with resulting reduction in business activity and rates. In connection with such challenging conditions, and in anticipation of potential enforcement action in respect

<<<

 of the Bonds, settlement arrangements were reached in May 2015 between the ultimate equity owners of Metro Ex and the Bond Trustee (for and on behalf of the Bondholders), under which, amongst other things, the shares in Metro Ex's parent, Metro

<<<

 Drilling Holding Corp., were transferred into the beneficial ownership of the Bondholders. The broader arrangements constituting the settlement are detailed in the summons dated 13 May 2015 to a bondholders' meeting in respect of the Bonds

<<<

 (the "Metro Ex Settlement"). Following the Metro Ex Settlement, the Bonds remain outstanding.
Further to the Metro Ex Settlement, certain of the largest Bondholders have been in discussions with the holders of the two bonds issued by Metro

<<<

 Ex's indirect subsidiaries, Chloe Marine Corporation Ltd. and Golden Close Maritime Corp. Ltd. (the "Chloe Marine Bondholders" and the "Golden Close

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

Bondholders"

<<<

, respectively) with a view to cooperating together to preserve their respective rights and interests.
In view of the continuing nature of those discussions, it is proposed that a suspension of the Issuer's obligations to satisfy the Interest

<<<

 Payment Requirement and the IRA Funding Requirement would be appropriate, in order to preserve the cash held in the Issuer's accounts.
Accordingly, the purpose of this summons is to seek approval of the Waivers, subject to the Waiver Termination

<<<

 Events (as defined below).
Each of the Waivers will be subject to, and will terminate immediately on the occurrence of, any of the following events:
(i) a decision to terminate that Waiver is reached in a Bondholders' Meeting convened and held

<<<

 in accordance with the terms o f the Bond Agreement; or
(ii) an "Insolvency" Event of Default occurs with respect to the Issuer, as described in more detail in Clause 15.1.5 of the Bond Agreement
(together, the "Waiver Termination Events")

<<<

.

2. The Proposal

The Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee with a request to convene a Bondholders' Meeting in order to put forward a proposal comprising the following elements (the "Proposal") to the Metro Ex Bondholders:

(a) approve and

<<<

 authorise the Waivers;

(b) approve and authorise the Waiver Termination Events; and

(c) instruct the Bond Trustee (in consultation with its advisers) to do all things and take such steps on behalf of the Bondholders as may be necessaiy or

<<<

 desirable in connection with the matters referred to in section 2(a) and (b) above, including, without limitation negotiating and approving the final terms of, and entering into, any and all documentation and agreements deemed necessary or

<<<

 desirable by the Bond Trustee.

3. Non-reliance

The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee and nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the

<<<

 Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate the Proposal and vote accordingly. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal, financial and tax advisers regarding the effect of the Proposal. The Bond Trustee

<<<

 expressly disclaims all liability related to information concerning Metro Ex and market conditions.

4. Bondholders' Meeting:

Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' Meeting:

"The Bondholders' Meeting approves the Proposal as described in section 2 in the summons to this Bondholders 'Meeting."
The above mentioned resolutions will, according

<<<

 to the Bond Agreement, require a 2/3 majority of the Voting Bonds represented at the Bondholders' Meeting voting in favour and a minimum 5/10 of the Voting Bonds being represented at the meeting. Bondholders may be represented in person or

<<<

 by proxy.
-oOoPlease find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depositoiy (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the

<<<

 Bondholders' Meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number

<<<

 in VPS on which the bonds are registered.) The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Nordic Trustee

<<<

 ASA to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post). In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the

<<<

 new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds. For practical puiposes, we request those who intend

<<<

 to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking
