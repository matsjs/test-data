 with Catena Media's ambitious growth targets, Catena Media is continuously exploring acquisition opportunities and reviewing its financing options for such acquisitions. In this regard, a mandate has been given to Carnegie Investment Bank AB

<<<

 (publ) and Danske Bank A/S, Danmark, Sverige Filial (the "Managers") to explore the possibilities of an early redemption of the Existing Bonds through a re-financing by issuance of a new bond loan with greater financial flexibility and a larger

<<<

 Offer"). Only the principal (and not accrued but unpaid interest) of Existing Bonds may be used as payment for Bonds. The principal of one (1) Existing Bond (EUR 100,000) makes up for payment of one (1) Bond with a principal of EUR 100,000

Applicants delivering Existing Bonds as payment for Bonds will receive, in cash, on or about the early redemption date of the Existing Bonds, (i) Interest on the delivered Existing Bonds for the period beginning on (but excluding) the Interest

<<<

 Payment Date of the Existing Bonds falling immediately prior to the issue date for the Bonds and ending on (and including) the early redemption date of the Existing Bonds and (ii) a premium of 3.38 per cent. of the Nominal Amount of the delivered

<<<

 Existing Bonds to reflect the premium of the applicable Call Option Price of the Existing Bonds.
The Exchange Offer will commence on 7 February 2018 at 09.00 CET and will expire on 16 February 2018 at 15.00 CET, unless the application period

<<<

 is shortened, extended or deferred, in the discretion of Catena Media, or the contemplated Bond Issue is cancelled by Catena Media.
Completion of the Exchange Offer is subject to all corporate resolutions of the Issuer required to implement

<<<

 the Exchange Offer and the Bond Issue (including approving the issuance of the Bonds) being validly made.
