4. In connection with the Transaction the Issuer and the Sponsor have requested that the Agent provides a waiver, in accordance with Clause 19(a)(i) of the Terms and Conditions, of certain terms under the Terms

 and Conditions as set out in further detail below.
5. In connection with the Transaction a Group Company has entered into a working capital facility with Nordea Bank AB (publ) at a total amount of SEK 75 million. Such facility falls within

<<<

 the definition of Working Capital Facility under the Terms and Conditions and constitutes Permitted Debt provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. A requirement for constituting Permitted Debt is that the amount of the Working Capital

<<<

 Facility which exceeds SEK 50 million is guaranteed by the Sponsor for the benefit of Nordea Bank AB (publ) and the Bondholders in accordance with the terms of an Intercreditor Agreement. The Sponsor and the Issuer have requested that Nordic

 Trustee & Agency AB (publ), as agent for the Bondholders shall consent to a waiver regarding the requirement that Nordea Bank AB (publ) has to enter into an Intercreditor Agreement provided that the Sponsor (i.e. Volati AB (publ)) issues a

<<<

 separate guarantee at an amount of SEK 25 million to the Bondholders for the Issuer's obligations under the Terms and Conditions (and certain other related obligations) and that the Issuer has undertaken to comply with certain undertakings

 in relation to the Working Capital Facility. Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) has, on behalf of the Bondholders, approved such waiver request considering that Volati AB (publ) has entered into the abovementioned guarantee and the undertakings

 made by the Issuer

2 (2)

<<<

 waiver described in item 5 above is effective as of 3 July 2017. 7. This notice is sent to the Bondholders pursuant to Clause 19(c) of the Terms and Conditions.
Yours faithfully, The Trustee NORDIC TRUSTEE & AGENCY AB (PUBL)
