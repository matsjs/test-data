As the Original Power of Attorney was approved at the Bondholders' Meeting held on 24 August 2009 by at least 50% of the Bondholders in each of the Bonds, the Trustee regarded such

<<<

 approval as satisfying its obligations to obtain written consent under the Original Power o f Attorney from Bondholders for the deferral of interest under each of the Bonds for the remainder of August and for the month of September and, accordingly

<<<

, the Trustee has agreed to a further deferral of the interest payments for each of the two Bonds for a period until 30 September and 1 October respectively.
Whilst the Original Power of Attorney provides for deferrals of the outstanding coupon

<<<

 payments originally due on 7 June 2009 and 25 June 2009 respectively, the Board of Nexus is now requesting a solution in respect of the coupon payments due on 7 September 2009 in respect of the USD 175 million Bond and 25 September 2009 in

<<<

 respect of the USD 75 million Convertible Bond.
As noted at the Bondholders' Meeting held 24 August 2009, additional time will be needed to resolve the challenges currently facing the Company and its stakeholders. Accordingly, it is anticipated

<<<

 that as well as the deferral of the outstanding interest payments contemplated by the Original Power of Attorney, extensions may be required in the future in relation to the deferral of interest payments due under the USD 175 million Bond on

<<<

 7 September 2009 and due under the USD 75 million Convertible Bond on 25 September 2009 respectively.
The First Proposal
The Company therefore proposes the following (the "First Proposal"):
For the USD 175 million Bond:
· The interest payment

<<<

 due 7 September 2009 to be deferred to 30 September 2009.
For the USD 75 million Convertible Bond:
· The interest payment due 25 September 2009 to be deferred to 1 October 2009.
The Second Proposal
In addition to the further extensions of the

<<<

 deferral of interest payments under the Bonds in respect of the payments due on 7 September 2009 and 25 September 2009, the Company is also asking Bondholders to amend the Original Power of Attorney granted to the Trustee at the Bondholders

<<<

' Meeting held 24 August 2009, so as to give the Trustee a power of attorney to agree to further deferrals of the interest payments due on 7 June 2009 and 7 September 2009 respectively for the USD 175 million Bond and 25 June 2009 and 25 September

<<<

 2009 respectively for the USD 75 million Convertible Bond, on the basis that such interest payments will be deferred on a monthly basis from the last Banking Day of the current month to the last Banking Day of the following month (or in the

<<<

 case o f the USD 75 million Convertible Bond, the immediately following Banking Day) (the "Amended Power of Attorney"). Such decision for further interest payment

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA www.mistec.no
deferrals by the Trustee shall be in agreement

<<<

 with a majority of the Bondholders (for the avoidance of doubt this consent shall not be required to be given in a Bondholders' meeting) in each of the USD 175 million Bond and the USD 75 million Convertible Bond, and subject to the lenders

<<<

 (the "Banks") under the working capital facility put in place by the Company under its existing term loan facility having agreed to release sufficient amounts from the proceeds account pledged in favour of the Banks in connection with such

<<<

 working capital facility (the "Proceeds Account") for the month in question, following a satisfactory review of the status of the project.
The Company therefore proposes the following (the "Second Proposal"):
For the USD 175 million Bond:


<<<

· The Original Power of Attorney granted to the Trustee at the Bondholders' Meeting held 24 August 2009 be terminated and the Trustee be given the Amended Power of Attorney on behalf of the Bondholders to agree to further deferrals of the interest

<<<

 payments originally due on 7 June 2009 and 7 September 2009 for periods running from the last Banking Day of the current month to the last Banking Day of the following month, provided that there may be no extension beyond the effective delivery

<<<

 date o f the Vessel under the Samsung Contract (as amended). Such decision for further interest payment deferrals by the Trustee shall be (a) subject to the Trustee obtaining written consent from Bondholders representing a minimum of 50% of

<<<

 the Bondholders in the USD 175 million Bond (for the avoidance of doubt this consent shall not be required to be given in a Bondholders' meeting), (b) subject to the Banks having agreed to release sufficient amounts from the Proceeds Account

<<<

 for the month in question, following a satisfactory review of the status of the project, and (c) subject to the interest payments originally due 25 June 2009 and 25 September 2009 related to the USD 75 million Convertible Bond being further

<<<

 deferred at the same time by the same number of days as the USD 175 million Bond (or otherwise to a date which shall be at least one Banking Day later than the deferred date for the interest payment on the USD 175 million Bond).
For the USD

<<<

 75 million Convertible Bond:
· The Original Power of Attorney granted to the Trustee at the Bondholders' Meeting held 24 August 2009 be terminated and the Trustee be given the Amended Power of Attorney on behalf of the Bondholders to agree

 which is no earlier than 2 Banking Days prior to the deferred date for the interest payment on the USD 75 million Convertible Bond).
