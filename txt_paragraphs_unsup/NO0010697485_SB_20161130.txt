SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - PROPOSAL FOR AMENDMENT AND WAIVERS

1.

INTRODUCTION

Nordic Trustee ASA, formerly known as Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above

<<<

-mentioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") of USD 400 million issued by Bluewater Holding B.V. ("Bluewater" or the "Issuer") and guaranteed by its parent Aurelia Energy N.V. (the "Parent") and various subsidiaries (together with

<<<

 the Parent, the "Guarantors").

The Bond Issue is regulated by the bond agreement entered into between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee on 9 December 2013 (the "Bond Agreement"). Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall

<<<

 have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement.

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and the described transactions and the proposal set out in Section 3 (The Proposal) below is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond

<<<

 Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons letter in its entirety.

2.

BACKGROUND

The Issuer specialises in the design, development, leasing and operation

<<<

 of floating production, storage and offloading ("FPSO") systems as well as a provider of single point mooring ("SPM") systems. Despite the headwinds the Issuer has been faced with during the recent downturn in the oil and gas market, the Issuer

<<<

 has been and continues to be engaged in discussions focused on securing new contracts as well as achieving extensions of existing contracts. Earlier this year, the Issuer embarked on a strategic review process to explore options to ensure sufficient

<<<

 liquidity remains available in the near and mid-term in order to sustain current activities and to fund any investments that may be necessaiy to redeploy the FPSO vessels for new contracts.

The Issuer has recently achieved progress with respect

<<<

 to the redeployment of its fleet by securing an exclusivity agreement for the FPSO Aoka Mizu, as announced on 29 November.

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

As part of the strategic process, the Issuer

<<<

 is in close dialogue with all of its stakeholders, including an ad hoc group of Bondholders, which together hold more than 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Bonds (the "AHC"). The strategic review process may lead to the implementation of certain

<<<

 solutions which may involve a range of components, such as potential equity or other transactions.

3.

THE PROPOSAL

The Issuer is proposing an amendment and waiver of certain provisions in the Bond Agreement and the Debt Service Reserve Account

<<<

 Pledge on the terms set out below. In addition, the Issuer proposes to introduce written resolutions as an alternative decision-making process for future amendments to and waivers of the Bond Agreement. The Issuer has been informed by the AHC

<<<

 that they support the Proposal (as defined below).

3.1 The Waivers
Specifically, the Issuer requests the following waivers (the "Waivers") in relation to its obligation to replenish the Debt Service Reserve Account and any potential Event

<<<

 of Default that may arise under the Bond Agreement in connection with the above mentioned discussions.

(a)

Release of funds from and suspension of requirement to transfer funds to the Debt Service

Reserve Account

The Issuer requests that

<<<

 an amount equivalent to the interest payment which is due under the Bond Agreement on 10 December 2016 (the "December Coupon"), is released to the Issuer from the Debt Service Reserve Account to be applied in accordance with this summons letter

<<<

 to pay the December Coupon.

Pursuant to the terms of clause 13.4.9 (Debt Service Reserve Account) of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer was obligated to make monthly payments into the Debt Service Reserve Account resulting in a total retained

<<<

 balance equivalent to at least six months' interest on the Bonds (the "Retention Amount"). Moreover, pursuant to the terms o f the Debt Service Reserve Account Pledge, the Issuer is obligated to maintain an amount equivalent to the Retention

<<<

 Amount in the Debt Service Reserve Account at all times during the term of the Bonds. The Issuer proposes that the requirement to replenish the Debt Service Reserve Account is suspended until 10 February 2017, i.e. the Issuer will on such date

<<<

 have an obligation to inject funds into the Debt Service Reserve Account resulting in a balance equal to the Retention Amount.

Upon a Bondholders' Meeting approving the Proposal, the Issuer shall sign and deliver an irrevocable instruction

<<<

 to the Bank (as defined in the Debt Service Reserve Account Pledge) to apply the Retention Amount in payment of the December Coupon, such instruction to be countersigned by the Bond Trustee to authorise the release of the Retention Amount 

<<<

(along with any other documentation necessary to release the Retention Amount, in all cases in a form satisfactory to the Bond Trustee) (the "Interest Payment Instruction"). The Issuer shall deliver the Interest Payment Instruction as soon as

<<<

 practicably possible, however, no Event of Default shall occur under the Bond Agreement (nor shall any additional amounts be payable in respect of the December Coupon under clause 11.5 {Interest in the event o f late payment) of the Bond Agreement

<<<

) provided that the December Coupon is received within five (5) Business Days of the date of the Bondholders' Meeting.

2

(b) Discussions with creditors
Further, the Issuer requests a waiver in relation to clause 16.1.5 (Insolvency) of the

<<<

 Bond Agreement such that the Bondholders waive any right to declare the Bonds to be in default and due for payment as a consequence of any breach of paragraph (i) of clause 16.1.5 {Insolvency) of the Bond Agreement insofar as any prior or future

<<<

 discussions up to 10 Februaiy 2017 held by the Issuer or other Obligors with Bondholders, the Bond Trustee, any other of its creditors or any of their respective advisors with regard to its financial position constitute a breach of such provision

<<<

. Such waiver under this Proposal shall not extend to any such discussions which may take place after 10 February 2017.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer has emphasised to the Bond Trustee that this Proposal does not mean or imply that

<<<

 there has been, is or will be an Event of Default under paragraph (i) of clause 16.1.5 {Insolvency) of the Bond Agreement as a result of the discussions referred to in this summons.
3.2 The Amendment The Issuer proposes to include provisions

<<<

 in the Bond Agreement to allow matters which may be resolved in a Bondholders' Meeting to be resolved by way of a written resolution procedure (the "Amendment" and together with the Waivers, the "Proposal"):

If the Proposal is approved by

<<<

 the Bondholders' Meeting:

(a)

the following definition shall be added as a new definition in clause 1.1 {Definitions) of the

Bond Agreement:

<<<

 in accordance with Clause 17.5 (Written Resolution)."
