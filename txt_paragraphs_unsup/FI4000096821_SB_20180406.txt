ISIN FI400009682.1 - ELEMATIC OYJ (PREVIOUSLY ELEMATIC OY AB) EUR 35,000,000 SENIOR SECURED CALLABLE BONDS 2014/2019

Summons for written resolution on proposed amendments of the Terms and

<<<

 Conditions and offering of warrants

We refer to Elematic Oyj (previously Elematic Oy Ab) (the "Issuer") EUR 35,000,000 Senior Secured Callable Bonds 2014/2018 (FI4000096821) (the "Bonds"). Nordic Trustee Oy (the "Bonds Agent") is under the

<<<

 terms and conditions of the Bonds originally dated 28 May 2014 and as amended and restated on or around 27 December 2016 (the "Terms and Conditions") appointed as trustee with respect to the Bonds.

Capitalised terms used herein, unless the

<<<

 context otherwise requires, shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Terms and Conditions.

The information provided in this letter regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by other parties than the Bonds Agent, and

<<<

 the Bonds Agent expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

This letter is presented to the Bondholders without evaluation or recommendations from the Bonds Agent. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether

<<<

 the requests and offerings set out in this letter are acceptable or not.

1. BACKGROUND

The Issuer has been engaged in negotiations with a view of rescheduling its Financial Indebtedness with certain Bondholders (the "Bondholder Committee

<<<

 Members"). The Bondholder Committee Members have in parallel agreed on a proposal with certain other Bondholders (together with the Bondholder Committee Members in total representing approximately 80 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount

<<<

, the "Major Bondholders") and the Issuer's other main creditors by reason of the Issuer's financial difficulties.

In relation thereto the Issuer and the Major Bondholders have also addressed certain related steps and amendments of the Terms

<<<

 and Conditions set out in a proposal by the Major Bondholders.

Such proposal reflects, among other things:

(a)

Termination of the Parent's shareholding in the Issuer in full by means of (i)

assignment and transfer of all its shares, other

<<<

 rights entitling to shares, any loans

C41515574.2

2 (8)

granted by the Parent to the Issuer and other claims against the Issuer, against a nominal total consideration of 1 euro to a company nominated by the Bondholder Committee Members

<<<

 (or the Bonds Agent acting on their behalf) ("Holdco") so that each Bondholder shall have a right to subscribe for or acquire shares in Holdco pro rata to the Adjusted Nominal Amount of the Bonds held by him/her, possibly combined with (ii

<<<

) a transfer to the Issuer and cancellation of the Parent's shares in the Issuer, so that the Bondholders (indirectly through Holdco) will as a consequence of measures under points (i) and (ii) hold 100 per cent. of the shares in the Issuer

<<<

 (the "Equity Transfer"). If one or several Bondholders do not exercise their right to subscribe for or acquire such shares, the remaining shares in Holdco shall be distributed to a trustee and sold to the benefit of these Bondholders pro rata

<<<

 to the Adjusted Nominal Amount of the Bonds held by them in an open auction process run by such trustee on account of such Bondholders within 3 months after the implementation of the amendments contemplated in the Request (as defined below

<<<

) and not later than 31 July 2018.

(b)

Assignment and transfer, against a nominal total consideration of 1 euro to Holdco, or

cancellation of any and all warrants or other rights entitling to shares in the Issuer that

may exist upon the

<<<

 completion of the Equity Transfer, including without limitation the

warrants issued to the Bondholders, the management and the current or former

shareholders of Pamplona PE HoldCo 6 S.A, so that the Bondholders (indirectly

through Holdco

<<<

) will upon the completion of the Equity Transfer hold 100 per cent. of

the shares in the Issuer on a fully diluted basis, subject to the issuance of Warrants as

described below (the "Cancellation of Existing Warrants").

(c)

Amendments to

<<<

 the Terms and Conditions introducing, among others, (i) a reduction

of the principal amount of the Bonds down to EUR 15.0 million (i.e. with

approximately 66.1 per cent. based on EUR 44.2 million being the total outstanding

amount 3/201

<<<

8 including accrued and capitalized PIK Interest), (ii) the extension of

the maturity of the senior financing (provided under the Bonds and the Senior Bank

Facilities) so that the new final redemption date of the Bonds is 30 June 2021 and

<<<

 the

new final repayment date of the Senior Bank Facilities 30 April 2021, (iii) reduction

of the Cash Interest to 8 per cent. p.a. and revocation of the PIK Interest, and (iv)

changes to the terms for redemption of the Bonds.

The reduction

<<<

 of the principal amount of the Bonds down to EUR 15.0 million may be structured either (x) as a waiver of such amount by the Bondholders or (y) in the absence of favorable tax ruling on exempt waiver income and dispensation on the utilization

<<<

 of the Issuer's tax losses after the Equity Transfer or other sufficient comfort on the acceptable tax implications of such waiver on the Issuer, in the discretion of the Bondholders representing at least 50.1 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal

<<<

 Amount (or the Bonds Agent acting on their behalf), as a transfer of the portion of the principal amount of the Bonds in excess of EUR 15.0 million by the Bondholders to Holdco e.g. as a contribution in kind in which connection such claims

<<<

 against the Issuer would, subject to appropriate technical means and practical arrangements on the transformation, be transformed into a loan considered as a Shareholder Loan under the Terms and Conditions, or converted as equity in the Issuer

<<<

 and the amendments to the Terms and Conditions adjusted so that the principal amount of the Bonds is not reduced.

3 (8)

As the proposal encompasses amendments of the Terms and Conditions, the Major Bondholders have requested the Bonds Agent

<<<

 to choose a Written Procedure in order to request the approval of the Bondholders for such draft amendments highlighted by the redlined version of the proposed amended and restated terms and conditions enclosed as Schedule 3 to this letter

<<<

 (the "Amendment").

The entry into force of the Amendment is subject to and conditional upon:

(i)

the completion of the Equity Transfer and the Cancellation of Existing Warrants,

combined with proper confirmations by the Parent and the former

<<<

 holders of rights

entitling to shares in the Issuer that they do not have claims against the Issuer or its

group companies under the existing the shareholders' agreements or otherwise based

on their holding of such securities, and

(ii)

<<<



the Issuer raising EUR 3.5 million new funding through a subordinated loan or equity

granted by Holdco, such loan or equity to be funded by Holdco issuing shares to

Bondholders representing in total a 33.0 per cent. equity ownership in Holdco

<<<

 so that

each Bondholder shall have a right to subscribe such shares in Holdco pro rata to the

Adjusted Nominal Amount of the Bonds held by him/her (at the terms outlined below

in paragraph 3).

Further, upon the completion of the Equity

<<<

 Transfer and the Cancellation of Existing Warrants and the entry into force of the Amendment, Holdco will make warrants available for subscription so that the management is offered warrants of up to 12.5 per cent. of the shares, and the Parent

<<<

 is offered warrants of up to 10.0 per cent. of the shares (at the terms outlined below in paragraph 4) (together the "Warrants"). The Warrants can be exercised at exit only (an Exercise Event as defined below in paragraph 4).

For the avoidance

<<<

 of doubt, any existing or new shares in the Issuer shall be subject to the security created by the Transaction Security Documents.

Unless (i) the Amendment is approved by the Bondholders and (ii) the arrangement described above in this paragraph

<<<

 1 agreed on with the Issuer, the Parent and OP Corporate Bank plc by 31 May 2018, the Issuer's financial position and other circumstances referred to in this paragraph 1 will constitute an Event of Default under Clause 15.4(a) of the Terms

<<<

 and Conditions. In addition, an Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) is also likely to occur under the Senior Facilities Agreement upon the expiry of a waiver issued by the Bank Creditors triggering cross-acceleration

<<<

 under Clause 15.3 of the Terms and Conditions. In any such event, the likely outcome is the Secured Creditors accelerating their claims and proceeding with security enforcement, including without limitation the enforcement of the pledge over

<<<

 the shares of the Issuer.

2. REQUEST FOR CONSENT TO AMENDMENT

The Major Bondholders have pursuant to Clause 17(b) of the Terms and Conditions directed a request to the Bonds Agent for a decision of the Bondholders on their approval of the

<<<

 amendments under the Terms and Conditions required for the purpose of completing the Amendment (the "Request"). The Major Bondholders have requested the Bonds Agent to choose a Written Procedure in order to request the approval of the Bondholders

<<<

.

4 (8)

As set out in more detail in the definition of Effective Date in the proposed amended and restated terms and conditions enclosed as Schedule 3 to this letter, the Amendment is subject to the following conditions precedent having been

<<<

 fulfilled, as confirmed by the Bondholders representing at least 50.1 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (or the Bonds Agent acting on their behalf):

(i)

such amended and restated terms and conditions having been approved and signed

<<<

 by

or on behalf of the Bondholders and the Issuer,

(ii)

OP Corporate Bank plc having confirmed to the Bonds Agent in writing (including for

the avoidance by letter or email) that its credit committee has approved certain

amendments to

<<<

 the Senior Facilities Agreement,

(iii)

completion of the Equity Transfer and the Cancellation of the Existing Warrants, and

(iv)

the Issuer having raised EUR 3.5 million new cash funding through a subordinated

loan or equity granted by

<<<

 Holdco, such loan or equity to be funded by Holdco issuing
