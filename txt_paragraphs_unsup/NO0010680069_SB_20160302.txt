/2018
Oslo, 2 March 2016
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
1. Introduction
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue with ISIN NO 001 0680069 (the "Bonds

<<<

" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Volstad Shipping AS (the "Issuer" or the "Company").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 29 May 2013 and made between the Bond Trustee and the

<<<

 Issuer (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein. References to Clauses and paragraphs are references to Clauses and paragraphs in the Bond Agreement.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are

<<<

 provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
2. Background
The Company's current fleet consists of six vessels, three large platform supply vessels ("PSV"), two subsea

<<<

 vessels and one factory trawler. The Company has one new subsea vessel (the "New Build") under construction at Tersan Yard Turkey, with delivery 28 March 2016.
Whilst the market for the factory trawler has had a positive development, the markets

<<<

 for oil service and offshore support service vessels deteriorated through 2015 and with accelerated pace into 2016. Numerous vessels are laid up in all segments of the oil service vessel ("OSV") industry and the competition for contracts is

<<<

 fierce.
This market situation has resulted in two of the Company's PSVs being laid up. The third PSV is contracted to the end of April 2016. No employment for the vessels that is accretive to the Company's cash flow compared to a lay-up has

<<<

 so far been identified.
One of the Company's subsea vessels is currently working under a bare-boat charterparty that expires second quarter 2017. The second subsea vessel has been contracted to DeepOcean AS with an original expiry date of 

<<<

29 September 2016. As stated in the press release from the Company dated 8 February, the Company received a notice of termination (the "Termination") of the charter party from DeepOcean AS. The Company strongly disagrees with DeepOcean AS, has

<<<

 rejected the Termination and will claim damages from DeepOcean AS for all relevant losses due to the Termination.
The Company has so far not been able to secure any employment contract for the New Build. Any take-out financing discussions for

<<<

 the New Build have been severely impacted by the market
L 7289452 VI 02.03.16 92222-016

2/7
downturn and the Company does currently not have any take-out financing for the New Build in place.
The Termination caused severe pressure on the

<<<

 Company's current and projected cash flow and caused severe financial difficulties of the Company. The short term liabilities of the Company, in particular the upcoming delivery of the New Build in absence of take-out financing, means that

<<<

 unless agreements with all creditors are made, the Company's continued existence is at risk.
Supported by its main banks the Company has initiated discussions with the ship yard and a majority of the Bondholders in the Bond Issue.
The Company

<<<

 is proposing an early redemption of the Bond Issue at 36% of nominal value, together with equity like economic interest in the OSV vessels, as further set out in the Proposal below.
The Company intends to do a restructuring of the group into

<<<

 two separate business units, one consisting of the OSV vessels and one consisting of the fishery assets, however, the specific restructuring steps have not been clarified at this point.
The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that Bondholders

<<<

 representing 70% of the Voting Bonds will vote in favour of the Proposal.
