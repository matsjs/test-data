SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - POSTPONEMENT OF INTEREST
1. INTRODUCTION Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as Loan Trustee

<<<

 for the above mentioned Loan where Marine Accurate Well ASA (the "Borrower" or "Maracc") is the Borrower. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Loan (the "Loan

<<<

 Agreement") unless otherwise stated herein. The information in this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information

<<<

.
2. BACKGROUND In addition to this summons letter, the Borrower has provided a separate document (appendix 1) which is intended to give an update of the Borrower's financial and operational status, which is enclosed to this summons. Bondholders

<<<

 are encouraged to read both documents.
3. PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT 3.1. Postponement of interest Reference is made to the resolution adopted in the Bondholders meeting on 10 July 2009 where the interest due under the Loan Agreement

The Borrower is proposing (the "Proposal") that all interest amounts due on 9 January 2010 (the "Due Interest Amount") is further postponed until 26 February 2010. For the avoidance

<<<

 of doubt, this means that both the interest amount initially postponed from July 2009 to January 2010 and the interest amount originally due in January 2010 will be postponed to February 2010.
The Due Interest Amounts shall bear overdue interest

<<<

 equal to the relevant coupon rate plus 5% p.a. (i.e. 14 % p.a.) until the Due Interest Amount is repaid in full. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that Bondholders entitled to interest at the interest payment date 9 January 2010 will receive

<<<

 the Due Interest Amount plus overdue interest on the Due Interest Amount as well as the increased coupon rate during the relevant period. 3.1. Increased Coupon Rate The Bonds will continue to bear the increased coupon rate equal to the relevant

<<<

 coupon plus 5 % p.a. (i.e. 14 % p.a.) until the Due Interest Amount is fully repaid.
4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL 4.1. Borrower's evaluation of the Proposal Maracc has received a conditional offer from Eksportfinans on a USD 235-255 mill loan

<<<

. This is subject to acceptable guarantee on the equivalent amount. GIEK has issued a "letter of willingness" for 80% of this amount. This is again subject to a qualified commercial bank(s) guaranteeing for the remaining 20%. The current financial

<<<

 climate has made such commercial bank financing challenging to obtain without the unit first being awarded a contract. The Borrower is currently pursuing several tenders for the Island Innovator. The Borrower is optimistic with regards to obtaining

<<<

 a contract for the rig during 1H 2010. This should enable the Borrower to become fully financed through loans from Eksportfinans/GIEK/commercial banks. The Borrower is working along several tracks to obtain a guarantee from a commercial bank

<<<

 at present stage, regardless of contract status on the rig, and has initiated a process of pursuing alternative financing structures for the outstanding amount as contingency planning. As a consequence of the above, the Borrower believes it

<<<

 is in the best interest of the Bondholders to accept the Proposal and thus allow necessary time for the Borrower to attain full financing. [An update and further details of current status is set out in appendix 1 hereto.]

<<<

 evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable.

The Loan Trustee also points out that the Proposal is

 from a commercial bank at present stage, regardless of contract status on the rig, and has initiated a process of pursuing alternative financing structures for the outstanding amount as contingency planning. As a consequence of the above, the
