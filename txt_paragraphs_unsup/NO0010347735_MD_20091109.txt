Assets - update CJ70 Jack up Rig

Update
· As detailed in the JOLs previous report on 1 July 2009, Jurong notified the JOLs that they were issuing

<<<

 a Notice of Default in accordance with the Amended CJ70 Contract, dated 18 November 2008, given that no payments had been received under the terms of the CJ70 Contract.
·O n 15 July 2009, Jurong exercised their right to terminate the CJ70 Contract

<<<

.
· Following this date, Jurong had been working with AMA in an attempt to seek a potential sale of the CJ70. Jurong provisionally agreed to suspend enforcement of their security until the 31 July 2009.
· Whilst providing a further opportunity

<<<

 for the CJ70 to be sold, Jurong emphasised that they wanted LOG to be involved in any sale. Jurong required that AMA and LOG furnish them with a proposal in terms of costs to completion and possible opportunities for the sale of the CJ70.


<<<

· The JOLs understand that AMA contacted LOG on a number of occasions, to obtain this information, however LOG did not respond. Further, Jurong were also unable to facilitate communication between the parties.
·A s a result, Jurong exercised

<<<

 their contractual powers in respect to the vessel on 1 September 2009 and accordingly the CJ70 Contract was terminated.
CJ70 Contract novation
· Following Jurong exercising their contractual powers in respect to the CJ70, Jurong contacted the

<<<

 JOLs in respect to a number of material owner furnished contracts that were held in the Company's name.
· As a result of an assignment dated 4 March 2009, the JOLs are advised that the Trustee for the 10.85% bondholders had full security over

<<<

 these contracts for the benefit of these bondholders.

· Jurong requested that the Trustee, in conjunction with the JOLs, agree to the novation of these contracts. The novation related to three specific contracts with the following suppliers

<<<

: Hydrill USA Distribution LLC; National Oilwell Norway AS and Vetco Gray Pte Ltd. In exchange for this novation Jurong offered a payment of US$8m.
· The Trustee's legal counsel, Bingham McCutchen LLP ("Binghams"), sought a vote from bondholders

<<<

 in respect to whether this offer from Jurong should be accepted.
· Any funds received in respect to this novation were specifically payable to the Trustee on behalf of the 10.85% bondholders.
· The bondholders voted in favour of the offer and

<<<

 the subsequent novations were executed by the Trustee, Jurong and the JOLs.
· The Trustee received US$8m directly. Confirmation that this matter is now closed was received from Jurong on 23 October 2009.

Assets FPSO - Vessel

Update
· As advised in

<<<

 the JOLs previous report, Jurong issued an admiralty writ in rem in respect of the FPSO on 7 July 2009. Jurong advised the JOLs that if payment was not made in respect to their outstanding invoices, within 21 days, they would exert their security

<<<

 over the vessel.
· Since this time, the JOLs along with AMA Capital Partners have liaised with a number of parties to complete a sale of the vessel.
· No sale was realised by 28 July 2009 (the end of Jurong's 21 days notice) and as such Jurong

<<<

 may proceed at any time to arrest the FPSO as a result of their admiralty w rit in rem. All contractual rights, including the sale of the assets without further notice to the JOLs became enforceable.
· Jurong subsequently advised that they

<<<

 would provide the JOLs with an extended deadline to 30 September 2009 with which to deal with the vessel but this has subsequently been extended to 15 October 2009 and again to 17 November 2009.
· Whilst no substantive offers have been made

<<<

 at the time of writing, AMA continue to work with all parties to effect a sale of the vessel. There are a couple of interested parties with whom ongoing discussions are taking place.

FPSO equipment
· Various equipment, purchased for installation

<<<

 on the FPSO, with a purchase order value of approximately US$56.4 million is stored in external third-party warehouses. Approximately US$9.3 million remains outstanding and payable to the various equipment suppliers on the equipment stored

<<<

 at these warehouses.
· A further US$19.4 million of plant and equipment, at purchase order value, is stored at the suppliers' own warehouses. An amount of US$8.6 million is owing on this plant and machinery.
· With the agreement of the Liquidation

<<<

 Committee, the JOLs engaged Noble Denton, an independent valuation agent. Noble Denton prepared a desk top valuation of the equipment stored in the three warehouses and in suppliers own warehouses.
· Noble Denton valued the equipment in groupings

<<<

 and estimated that a value of between US$48.3m and US$36.9m could be obtained if the equipment was sold on the open market.
· However, given that the equipment is not free from encumbrances and some of the equipment remains with its original

<<<

 suppliers, the possible net realisation in respect to the plant and equipment following payment of the outstanding liabilities is between approximately US$30.5m and US$19.1m.
· There would be further deductions in respect to these amounts in

<<<

 relation to the costs of warehousing the plant and equipment; a brokerage fee (estimated at 5% of gross realisations) and further costs for the JOLs and their advisors. We expect these costs to total approximately US$3.5m therefore leaving

<<<

 a potential return to the estate of approximately US$15.6m.

Assets FPSO - Vessel
· In the course of our dealings with Jurong they have enquired to the current status of the plant and machinery. Jurong initially claimed that they believed that they

<<<

 were in control / possession of all of the plant and machinery (excluding the swivel stack and turrets) as a result of their connection/relationship with the warehouses. Jurong were not able to provide any evidence to substantiate their claim

<<<

 and subsequent to a number of conversations, the JOLs are now satisfied that Jurong do not have any possession or rights over the equipment.
· Jurong are interested in purchasing the plant and machinery and the JOLs understand that Jurong have

<<<

 made an offer of US$12.5m. The JOLs were originally looking for an amount in the region of US$15m given the valuations provided by Noble Denton.
· However, the JOLs realise that if Jurong were able to make a payment of US$12.5m immediately

<<<

 for the equipment that their costs would be greatly reduced and no brokerage fee would be payable. Additionally, any third party sale through a broker would be very much dependent on the market's current appetite for this kind of work and could

<<<

 take a number of months to complete.
· Any sale will require the agreement of the bondholders and the JOLs understand that Bingham's are in the process of arranging this.

Assets Cash

Current Cash position
· The cash position of the Company and

<<<

 the Subsidiaries at 30 September 2009 can be summarised as follows:

Current Cash Unrestricted cash Escrow FRNs Escrow 10.85% Subsidiaries Total

US$m 11.2 16.2 11.3 0.1 38.8

· The unrestricted cash is held at Royal Bank of Canada in the Cayman

<<<

 Islands. RBC, which operates as a branch of RBC (Canada) is rated Aa2 by Moody's. RBC is Canada's largest bank.
· The funds are currently earning a nominal interest rate.
· The convertible bondholders have a subrogated claim to both of the

<<<

 escrow accounts. The convertible bondholders do not have a separate interest in any escrow account.
· As at 31 October 2009, we understand that the escrow monies have been paid to the Trustee, pending distribution to the respective bondholders

<<<

. However, we are still awaiting confirmation of this and the amounts.

Payments

· The only payments made from the Company's bank account relate to the JOLs fees and those of their advisors. Further details in respect to these fees is located

<<<

 on page 12 of this report.

Assets Other Assets

Insurance claim in respect to PetroProd 3 Ltd · We have received correspondence from Willis Insurance in Norway in respect to a claim PetroProd 3 has in connection to the FPSO that was previously

<<<

 sold. · We understand that this claim still requires adjudication from the adjusters however we expect to receive funds in the region of US$300k within the next 2 - 3 months.
Outstanding Receivable · Having taken possession of the Company's

<<<

 books and records, the JOLs were able to perform an in depth analysis in respect to any outstanding receivables. · The JOLs have identified one receivable which they consider to be collectable in the sum of US$85k which is owed to PetroProd

<<<

 3 Ltd. · The JOLs are liaising with this counterparty with a view to seeking recovery of these funds.

Shares in PetroResources
· As previously outlined in the JOLs reports, the Company purchased an equity interest in PetroResources in June

<<<

 2008. The value of the investment was written down before the liquidation in December 2008 from an original investment of US$6m to US$3m.
· The JOLs have taken legal advice in respect to the likelihood of a recovery in respect to this investment

<<<

. The JOLs understand from their Cayman counsel that the issued shares held by the Company do not appear to be reedemable at the option of PetroResources, as holder thereof. In summary, the Company is therefore unable to compel PetroResources

<<<

 to redeem its shareholding for value.
· However, subject to there being a secondary market in the shares, PetroProd has the ability to effect a transfer of its shares. This is subject to the articles and various other legal procedures.
· There

<<<

 is also the possibility that the JOLs could come to an agreement with PetroResources in respect to the repurchase of these shares however this would fall outside of the express powers of the articles and would be subject to Cypriot law.
· The

<<<

 JOLs have not yet been able to assess the commercial benefit in respect to the Company's interest in these shares, However, on the basis that there may be substantial value in these shares, the JOLs consider that it would be prudent to engage

<<<

 Cyprian counsel to advise on which of these options maybe the most effective way of realising the Company's interest (if any) in the shares.

Legal Issues Preference Action against Larsen Oil & Gas

Update
· At a meeting of the Liquidation Committee

<<<

 held on 6 August 2009, it was agreed that the JOLs should take steps to lodge the preference action against LOG in the Singapore Court. (Such an application could now be made on the basis that the Company was in liquidation in Singapore).


<<<

· The preference action was lodged in the Singapore Courts on 3 September 2009. Additionally, on 4 September 2009, the JOLs Singapore counsel lodged an application seeking a Mareva injunction against LOG. On the same date the Court granted the

<<<

 Mareva injunction.
· The Mareva Injunction served to freeze LOG's assets in Singapore. It further required that LOG provide a detailed listing of their assets by affidavit submission no later than 15 September 2009.
· LOG have complied with

<<<

 the Order, submitting an affidavit disclosing cash of approximately US$500k and a combination of office equipment, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles of approximately US$2.6m. It should be noted that it is unlikely that any sale of the

<<<

 balance sheet assets would result in a value of US$2.6m being obtained (assuming that the preference action was itself successful).
· On 22 September 2009, the JOLs Singapore Counsel attended a pre trial conference in respect to the action

<<<

 with LOG's legal counsel.
· LOG's lawyer advised the Court that they expected to be able to respond to the preference action submitted by the JOLs within 8 weeks. LOG's lawyers cited the numerous allegations and voluminous affidavit to be the

<<<

 reason for the protracted timescale.
· The Court asked both the JOL's legal counsel and LOG's legal counsel whether they would approve converting the action into a writ action. The JOLs legal counsel confirmed their agreement to this.

· LOG

<<<

's legal counsel however advised the Court that they did not have instructions from their client as to whether they would agree to the action being converted into a writ action and therefore were unable to agree to such.
· LOG's legal counsel

<<<

 also advised that LOG were contemplating initiating a stay application in respect to the preference action due to an arbitration clause in the Management Agreement.
· The Court ordered that LOG's legal counsel obtain his clients instructions

<<<

 in respect to both the stay application and the conversion of the preference action into a writ action ahead of the next Pre Trial conference on 6 October 2009.
· At the Pre Trial conference held on 6 October 2009, LOG's legal counsel confirmed

<<<

 they had no objection to the conversion of the action to a writ action.
· They did however advise that they required further time in respect to the pleadings. They also advised that they are still awaiting their clients instructions in respect

<<<

 to the stay application.
· The Singapore Court advised that it did not consider these difficulties to be insurmountable and that LOG should file pleadings in accordance with the following timeline:
· PetroProd to file statement of claim by

<<<

 31 October 2009 (the JOLs Singapore counsel are in the process of preparing this);
· LOG to file its defence by 27 November 2009;
· PetroProd to serve and file any reply by 18 December 2009.

Legal Issues Preference Action against Larsen Oil

<<<

 & Gas

Update (continued)
· Additionally, a further Pre Trial conference has been scheduled for 10 November 2009 to allow LOG to update the Court on any possible stay action and review any compliance issues with the above timetable.

Obligations

<<<

 under the Mareva injunction · The Mareva injunction requires LOG to provide details to the JOLs of any payments made from the company's bank accounts in the normal course of business. The information that LOG have provided is insufficient and

<<<

 provides the JOLs with no comfort over the transactions that have occurred. · The JOLs legal counsel have therefore written to LOG's legal advisors and requested that LOG provide further information in respect to these transactions. This information

<<<

 should include copy purchase orders and invoices, delivery notes in respect to any goods and copies of any contractual documentation

Cancellation of the Management Agreement · The JOLs legal advisors have advised that there would be no benefit

<<<

 at this time in cancelling the Management Agreement. The Management Agreement therefore remains in place but is under review by the JOLs on a periodic basis.

Stay application · We understand from our Singapore legal counsel that at the hearing

<<<

 held on 2 November 2009 in respect to LOG's application to stay the delivery up proceedings, the application was not opposed by our Singapore counsel. The non-contestation of the application was on the condition that the stay shall not affect

<<<

 LOG's obligations pursuant to the Court Order dated 30 June 2009. The Judge therefore stayed the proceedings and confirmed that the stay shall not prejudice or affect the Court Order dated 30 June 2009 and the obligations imposed on LOG thereby

Legal Issues Update on ongoing issues

Control of the Subsidiaries · As advised in the JOLs previous reports, the Company is now the sole director of each of the subsidiary Companies. · The JOLs continue to liaise with their legal counsel

<<<

 in Cayman and Singapore to assess the need of placing these Company's into liquidation. · At this time, the JOLs and their legal advisers cannot identify any particular commercial or legal reason why this would be beneficial. The JOLs continue

<<<

 to monitor this position.
Recognition in Singapore and the Cayman Islands · The JOLs are pleased to advised that on 3 August 2009, the Company was placed in liquidation in Singapore. PCF Yuen, BYC Ghee and TP Cheng (all of KPMG Singapore),

<<<

 and Simon Whicker of KPMG Cayman were appointed jointly and severally as liquidators of the Company. · Please note that Simon Whicker's appointment is subject to the Minister's approval pursuant to section 9 of the Companies Act (Cap. 50).

<<<


Official Liquidation in Cayman ·A s a result of the insolvency of the Company and the fact that any restructuring of the business was highly unlikely the JOLs instructed their Cayman counsel to apply to the Cayman Court to place the Company

<<<

 into Official Liquidation. · The hearing was heard by the Cayman Court on 17 July 2009 and the judge ordered that the Company be placed into Official Liquidation. Simon Whicker and Kris Beighton, the former JPLs were subsequently appointed

<<<

 as JOLs.

Larog
· The JOLs have taken steps to ascertain the procedure required to transfer the FPSO from Larog back to PetroProd 1 Ltd. However, until the outcome in respect to the FPSO is certain, the JOLs on the recommendation from their

<<<

 legal counsel have decided that, in the interests of saving costs, the vessel should remain at the Larog level.
Books and Records
· Following the Singapore Court Order on 30 June 2009, compelling the delivery up of the Company's books and records

<<<

, KPMG in Singapore spent a substantial amount of time extracting the books and records in both hard and soft copy format.
· Following an analysis of the books and records that have been retrieved the JOLs are seeking confirmation, in the form

<<<

 of an affidavit, from LOG that all books and records pertaining to the Company [and its subsidiaries] have been surrendered.
· The application to compel LOG to provide such an affidavit has been made to the Court.

· The JOLs have obtained approval of their fees from the Liquidation Committee for the provisional

<<<

 liquidation period to 19 July 2009. However, when seeking approval, the Liquidation Committee raised concerns regarding the level of the JOLs fees. As a result, the JOLs have applied a 15% discount to their fees for the period 1 June 2009 

<<<

- 19 July 2009 representing US$103k. Please note that this discount is in addition to the already reduced rates in respect to both partner and manager grades of staff.
