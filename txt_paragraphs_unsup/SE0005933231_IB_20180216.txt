Summary
· The Bondholder Committee has on 15 February 2018 entered into a restructuring and lock-up agreement (the "Lock-up Agreement") including a term sheet (the "Term Sheet") in relation to the proposed

<<<

 restructuring of the Company's assets, mainly the Company's material subsidiaries (including the Guarantors under the Existing Bonds that for the time being have been put into voluntary liquidation with the trustee of the Estate appointed as

<<<

 liquidator) (the "Operating Companies") and their wind turbines, (the "Restructuring"). Closing of the Restructuring is estimated to take place during the second quarter 2018.
· The parties to the Lock-up Agreement undertake to, inter alia

<<<

, (i) vote in favour of the Restructuring in a written procedure intended to be initiated by 5 March 2018 at the latest; and (ii) not to sell their holdings of Existing Bonds during a lock-up period other than with a right of first refusal for

<<<

 the other parties and during an initial hard lock-up period only to the other parties.
· As part of the Restructuring, the Existing Bonds will be exchanged into equity and a reinstated bond (the "Reinstated Bond") in a newly established special

<<<

 purpose vehicle in the form of a Swedish limited liability company (Sw. aktiebolag) ("NewCo"), that will acquire, inter alia, the shares in the Operating Companies from the Estate (subject to agreement on a share and loan purchase agreement

<<<

 with the Estate). The equity in NewCo will be allocated between the holders of Existing Bonds based on their pro rata holding of Existing Bonds but also depending on their participation in the SSF (as defined below).

· The Operating Companies

<<<

 will in connection to closing of the acquisition from the Estate, receive new cash funding through a super senior facility (the "SSF"). The SSF is fully underwritten by the Bondholder Committee.

<<<

 or indirectly, registered in the debt register for the Existing Bonds held with Euroclear Sweden AB on 28 February 2018 (the "First Record Date") are hereby invited by the Bondholder Committee to participate in the SSF pro rata to its holding

<<<

 of Existing Bonds on the First Record Date.

The Restructuring and the SSF
For a full description

<<<

 of the Restructuring and the main documents for the Restructuring (including the SSF), please refer to the Lock-up Agreement and Term Sheet. The Restructuring can be summarised as follows:
· a significant portion of the Existing Bonds shall

<<<

 be exchanged into equity (mandatory convertible instruments (Sv. konvertibler)) and the Reinstated Bond in NewCo. The remainder of the Existing Bonds shall remain as a claim by all holders of Existing Bonds against the Estate;
· NewCo will

<<<

 acquire the Operating Companies, any intragroup loans provided by the Company to the Operating Companies and potentially

3
other assets from the Estate (subject to agreement on a share and loan purchase agreement with the Estate); · NewCo

<<<

 and/or the Operating Companies will receive new cash funding through the SSF; · the Reinstated Bond will rank below the SSF but before the equity and will be allocated to all holders of Existing Bonds based on their pro rata holding of Existing

<<<

 Bonds; · the SSF will consist of a MSEK 40 super senior facility (that may wholly or partially be construed as a UCITS investor compliant bond) with an original issue discount (OID) of 12.5 per cent., providing a cash funding of MSEK 35 to

<<<

 NewCo and/or the Operating Companies (with headroom for an additional MSEK 10, uncommitted on the same terms). The SFF will have cash interest of 7.5 per cent. and a term of 36 months. Further, the SFF will entitle to a preference return of

<<<

 20 percent of MSEK 40 in the event of a sale of substantially all assets or a majority of the shares in NewCo/the Operating Companies. The SSF will be fully underwritten by the Bondholder Committee with an underwriters fee of 5 per cent.; 

<<<

· both the Reinstated Bond and the SSF will be secured with priority for the SSF. The SSF's preference return will rank behind the Reinstated Bond but ahead of any other future unsecured indebtedness of NewCo; · the equity in NewCo will be split

<<<

 between all holders of Existing Bonds. Those holders of Existing Bonds that contribute to the SSF will share 70 per cent. (63 per cent. if management incentive shares) of the equity in NewCo pro rata to their SSF contribution. Holders of Existing

<<<

 Bonds who does not participate in the SSF will share the remaining 30 per cent. (27 per cent. if management incentive shares) of the equity pro rata to their holding of Existing Bonds. There will be a possibility to issue shares to management

<<<

 corresponding to maximum 10 per cent. of the equity (pro forma on a fully diluted basis considering the convertibles unless already booked as equity). The holding of equity in NewCo will be governed by a standard term shareholders' agreement

<<<

 including drag-along, tag-along and pre-emption rights, etc. and the receipt of equity by the holders of Existing Bonds is subject to the entry into such shareholders' agreement; · the intention is to initiate an exit through a private sale

<<<

 or public listing of NewCo or the Operating Companies or a sale of NewCo's and/or the Operating Companies' assets no later than 30 months after the first utilisation date under the SSF; · Robus (as defined below) has, upon the request of the

<<<

 trustee of the Estate, offered a bridge facility to the Operating Companies to bridge urgent financing needs of the Operating Companies (to be used for maintenance

4
and repair work on the wind turbines and to stabilise cash flow) before

<<<

 the Restructuring is completed (the "Bridge Facility"), subject to the provision of security over certain assets by the Operating Companies. The Bridge Facility is subject to negotiation and agreement with the trustee of the Estate and will

<<<

, to the extent provided, be rolled-over to the SSF upon the first utilisation date under the SSF; · Robus may through its participation in the SSF and its holding of Existing Bonds become a majority owner of NewCo and will as such take an active

<<<

 role in the development of NewCo and its assets; · Closing of the Restructuring is estimated to take place during the second quarter 2018.
