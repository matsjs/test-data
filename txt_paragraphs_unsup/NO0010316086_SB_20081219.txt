 construction at Jurong Shipyard in Singapore. The rigs have expected delivery dates at 30th April 2009, 30th September 2009 and 31st January 2010 respectively.
Rig 1 and Rig 2 are included in the security package for the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue

<<<

 by i.a. the Assignment of Construction Contract (pre delivery) and the Mortgage and Assignment of Insurances (post delivery), while i.a. the shares in the Singapore Subsidiaries are included in the security package for the USDm 300 Bond Issue

<<<

 by Share Charges. In addition, the Company owns one operating drilling rig ("SS Petrolia") through its subsidiary Petromena Limited, which is also included in the security package for the USDm 300 Bond Issue. Rig 3 is part of the security package

<<<

 for a NOK 1,600 million bond issue issued by the subsidiary Petrorig III Pte Ltd. All four rigs owned by the Company have secured time charter contracts.
In order to complete the construction of the three new rigs and to bring the units into

<<<

 operation, the Group has remaining capital expenditures of approximately USD 300 million per rig, USD 900 million in total.
In late 2007, the Group established a USD 200 million bank financing for each of these rigs from Lloyds TSB Bank, equaling

<<<

 the maximum amount of first priority debt (the "First Priority Debt") allowed under the Bond Loan Agreements. The finalization of this loan facility presupposes i.a. finalization of an inter-creditor agreement with the Loan Trustee, such finalization

<<<

 yet to occur. However, the currently undrawn USD 200 million credit facility for each rig will not be sufficient to fully fund each rig as there is a funding gap of approximately USD 100 million per rig in order to bring the units into operation

<<<

.
Petromena has over time explored various alternatives to meet this funding requirement. The bank financing market has been extremely tight for months, as banks are generally unable or unwilling to assume new commitments. Petromena has, however

<<<

, initiated discussions with Lloyds TSB Bank and another bank to jointly provide the required amount needed to fully finance and take delivery of Rig 1 and get the rig into operation. These banks have provided the Company with an indicative

<<<

 term sheet for a USD 300 million bank facility related to Rig 1.
Lloyds TSB Bank has indicated that a precondition for the new facility is that Lloyds TSB Bank is released from the previous facilities related to the rigs, USD 600 million in

<<<

 total. Accordingly, if the new bank facility is implemented, the Company will have a funding gap of approximately USD 300 million with respect to Rig 2 and USD 300 million with respect to Rig 3.
The Company is of the opinion that it is a preferred

<<<

 alternative to fund and finalize Rig 1 separately on the terms indicated from the banks, while actively seeking necessary financing of Rig 2 and Rig 3, unless a better solution for financing Rig 1 is established within a short time frame.
On

<<<

 this basis, it would be a preferable alternative for the Company and bondholders to carry out an additional debt financing for an amount equaling the USD 100 million "gap" between the existing bank facility of USD 200 million for Rig 1 and

<<<

 the financing

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
need of USD 300 million for Rig 1, which is compatible with the existing bank facilities from Lloyds TSB Bank. This could be provided as a bond, conventional debt etc. with priority in between

<<<

 the existing Lloyds TSB Bank facility and the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue.
However, in the Company's opinion, the alternative representing the new Lloyds TSB Bank facility combined with another bank is the base case and the most realistic avenue

<<<

 given the current market conditions. The proposal below is compatible with all alternatives involving USD 300 million of debt with better priority than the NOKm 2.000 Bond Issue and the USDm 300 Bond Issue.
All alternatives involving USD 3

<<<

00 million of debt with better priority than the NOKm 2.000 Bond Issue and USDm 300 Bond Issue in Rig 1 and Rig 2 require changes in the Bond Agreements in order to be implemented, as the Bond Loan Agreements are limiting the first priority

<<<

 carve-out to USD 200 million related to Rig 1. Accordingly, the Company will put forward a proposal to increase this carve-out in the Bond Loan Agreements for an amount up to USD 300 million as described below. This will, according to the Company

<<<

, be sufficient to finance the yard delivery installment and other costs that are needed in order to bring Rig 1 into operation.
For flexibility reasons, the loans to be obtained as First Priority Debt may i.a include bank loans and/or bond

<<<

 loans etc. In addition, and also for flexibility purposes, the First Priority Security may consist of first priority security (if the lenders are equally ranking lenders) or first and second priority security (if the lenders are not equally

<<<

 ranking lenders). In case of the latter, the security for the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue and the NOK 300 Bond Issue will be ranking with third and fourth priority respectively. However, they will only rank behind the amount being the First Priority

<<<

 Debt consisting of USD 300 million.
2. THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE BOND LOAN AGREEMENTS:
The Company puts forward the proposals ("the "Proposals") below for the respective Bond Loan Agreements. In order that a valid resolution shall be adopted

<<<

 for each of the Loans, the proposed changes must be approved by the Bondholders' meetings in each of the Loans described herein.
2.1. FOR THE NOKm 2,000 BOND ISSUE
2.1.1. Increase the carve-out amount for First Priority Debt related to Ris

<<<

 1 Petromena is proposing to increase the allowed carve-out amount for First Priority Debt related to Rig 1 from USD 200 million to USD 300 million and proposes that the first priority loan security related to Rig 1 shall be USD 300 million

<<<

, plus interest, cost and expenses. Accordingly the First Priority Debt will be maximum USD 500 million where maximum USD 300 million may relate to Petrorig I and maximum USD 200 million may relate to Petrorig II. The First Priority Debt might

<<<

 consist of one loan or a combination of various bank and/or bond loans and may include a pre delivery credit facility of up to USD 50 million with First Assignment in the Construction Contract for
3

NO RSK TIL L IT SM A N N ASA
Rig 1 (such

<<<

 proceeds to be utilized for the purpose of getting Rig 1 delivered and into operation).
The maximum allowed First Priority Debt in Petrorig I shall be reduced with USD 30 million within the date falling four years after Settlement Date and

<<<

 with additional USD 30 million five years after Settlement Date. The maximum allowed First Priority Debt in Petrorig II shall be reduced with USD 20 million within the date falling four years after Settlement Date and with additional USD 2

<<<

0 million five years after Settlement Date.
2.1.2. No First Priority Assignment related to Ris 2 until delivery o f such rig Petromena is also proposing a change where after the Group is not allowed to offer any First Priority Assignment in

<<<

 the Construction Contract for Rig 2. Accordingly, the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue will have the highest priority assignment in the Construction Contract related to Rig 2 during this period (however, until delivery, the yard will have full title of

<<<

 relevant rig, and de facto have full control of the rig both by ownership as well as maritime lien).
For the avoidance of doubt, Petrorig II shall be allowed to (pre) agree upon a new First Priority Debt to be paid upon delivery with i.a. First

<<<

 Mortgage in Rig 2 upon delivery.
The present carve-out for Rig 2 following delivery will remain. Hence, after delivery of both Rig 1 and Rig 2 the Group is allowed to take up USD 300 million of First Priority Debt related to Rig 1 and USD 

<<<

200 million of First Priority Debt related to Rig 2.
Such First Priority Debt shall not be cross collateralized unless this is required by the lenders (i.e. if the same bank(s) should provide the bank loan facility for Rig 1 and Rig 2).
2.1

<<<

.2. Improved security package on second priority
As part of the amendment proposal, Petromena will propose that the security for the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue is improved to reflect the security package for the First Priority Debt to the extent

<<<

 possible, however ranking with second priority in all relevant assets behind the First Priority Security. It is also suggested that the security package for the NOKm 300 Bond Issue will be amended correspondingly, however ranking with third

<<<

 priority in the relevant assets.
The current security under the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue is as follows:
Deposit Account Pledge(s), Assignment of Construction Contracts in respect of the construction contracts for Rig 1 and Rig 2 (pre delivery

<<<

) and Rig Mortgage and Assignment of Insurances (post delivery). All security ranks presently with first priority, however (other than the Deposit Account Pledge) to rank with second priority after the First Priority Security.

N O R SK T

<<<

 ILLITSM A N N ASA
The following security package in favor of the Loan Trustee is proposed (all other than the Deposit Account Pledge ranking with second priority after the First Priority Security):
(i) Deposit Account Pledge issued by Petromena

<<<

 ASA in favor of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (remain unchanged),
(ii) Assignment of Construction Contracts in Rig 1 and Rig 2 issued by Petrorig I and Petrorig II respectively in favor of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (pre-delivery remain unchanged),
(iii

<<<

) Rig Mortgages to be issued by Petrorig 1 and Petrorig II against Rig 1 and Rig 2 in favor of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (post delivery - remain unchanged),
(iv) Assignment of Insurances to be issued by Petrorig I and Petrorig II against insurances

<<<

 related to Rig 1 and Rig 2 in favor of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (post delivery - remain unchanged),
(v) Share Charge against all shares in Petrorig I and Petrorig II issued by Petromena ASA in favor of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (new security),
(vi

<<<

) Assignment of earnings and accounts and other rights and security assets in respect of Rig 1 and Rig 2 similar to the security for the First Priority Debt but on second priority (new security).
2.1.4. Introduce a zero dividend covenant The

<<<

 Bond Loan Agreement for the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue includes a clause that allows the Company to distribute dividends in an amount equaling maximum 30% of net profit, provided that the Group's book equity exceeds 40% (also provided that both

<<<

 Rig 1 and Rig 2 have been delivered). The Company now proposes to replace the existing dividend restriction with a clause stating that the Company shall not distribute any dividends (including repurchase of shares, other distributions to its

<<<

 shareholders or total return swaps involving own shares) whatsoever during the term of the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue.
2.1.5. Introduce a USD tranche in the NOKm 2.000 Bond Issue The Company has a significant unrealized FX profit (agio) related

<<<

 to the NOK bonds within the Company's group. Compared to the issue date, the unrealized profit is approximately USD 40 million related to the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue. The Company therefore proposes to establish a USD tranche under the NOKm 2

<<<

,000 Bond Issue with similar terms as the existing NOK tranche except for denomination in USD and a new ISIN (i.e. same interest rate, same payment date, same security package, etc.). The NOK tranche will be written down by the amount that accepts

<<<

 the voluntary transfer to the USD tranche.
If approved by the Bondholders' meeting, those Bondholder's who (on a voluntary basis) want to switch into a USD tranche may do so at 23 January 2009 at the valid rate of exchange on such date. This

<<<

 should be positive for all investors who prefer USD
5

N O RSK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
exposure. The voluntary offer to conversion into a USD tranche will be carried out through an offer where the Bondholder accept to sell its currents holdings

<<<

 of the NOK tranche to the Borrower at par plus accrued interest and buy new USD Bond at par (plus accrued interest - i.e. interest on the USD tranche will commence from and including the previous interest payment date on the NOK tranche).
For

<<<

 avoidance of doubt, the proposed introduction of a USD tranche shall be handled as a separate case and voted on independently of the other amendment proposals.
Please observe that the security improvement for both Bond Loan Agreements is subject

<<<

 to an inter-creditor agreement being entered into between the Loan Trustee (representing the bondholders) and the lenders under the First Priority Debt; such inter creditor agreement to be on terms and conditions customary for a first priority

<<<

 lender and security holder in international finance transactions, reflecting the waterfall structure.
2.2. FOR THE USDm 300 BOND ISSUE
2.2.1. Increase the carve-out amount for First Priority Debt related to Ris 1 Petromena is proposing to increase

<<<

 the allowed carve-out amount for First Priority Debt related to Rig 1 from USD 200 million to USD 300 million, and also suggest that the first priority loan security related to Rig 1 shall be USD 300 million, plus interest, cost and expenses

<<<

. Accordingly the First Priority Debt will be maximum USD 500 million where maximum USD 300 million may relate to Petrorig I and maximum USD 200 million may relate to Petrorig II. The First Priority Debt might i.a. consist of one loan or a combination

<<<

 of various bank and/or bond loans and may include a pre delivery credit facility of up to USD 50 million with First Assignment in the Construction Contract for Rig 1 (such proceeds to be utilized for the purpose of getting Rig 1 delivered and

<<<

 into operation).
The maximum allowed First Priority Debt in Petrorig I shall be reduced with USD 30 million within the date falling four years after Settlement Date and with additional USD 30 million five years after Settlement Date. The maximum

<<<

 allowed First Priority Debt in Petrorig II shall be reduced with USD 20 million within the date four years after Settlement Date and with additional USD 20 million five years after Settlement Date.
2.2.2. No First Priority Assignment related

<<<

 to Ris 2 until delivery o f such rig Petromena is also proposing a change where after the Group is not allowed to offer any First Priority Assignment in the Construction Contract for Rig 2. Accordingly, the USDm 300 Bond Issue will have the

<<<

 second highest priority assignment in the Construction Contract related to Rig 2 during this period with priority after the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue (however, until delivery, the yard will have full title of relevant rig, and de facto have full

<<<

 control of the rig both by ownership as well as maritime lien).
For the avoidance of doubt, Petrorig II shall be allowed to (pre) agree upon a First Priority Debt to be paid upon delivery with i.a. First Mortgage in Rig 2 upon delivery.

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
The present carve-out for Rig 2 following delivery will remain. Hence, after delivery of both Rig 1 and Rig 2 the Group is allowed to take up USD 300 million of First Priority Debt related to Rig 1 and USD 

<<<

200 million of First Priority Debt related to Rig 2.
Such First Priority Debt will not be cross collateralized unless this is required by the lenders (i.e. if the same lenders should provide the loan facility for Rig 1 and Rig 2).
2.2.3. Improved

<<<

 security package for SS Petrolia In addition to the Guarantee from Petromena Limited (the "Guarantor"), Deposit Account Pledge on first priority and the first priority Share Charge against the shares in the Guarantor, the current security under

<<<

 the USDm 300 Bond Issue related to SS Petrolia are as follows:
1. Rig Mortgage against SS Petrolia on first priority,
2. Assignment and pledges in respect of the earnings from the Pemex contract related to SS Petrolia
Petromena will propose

<<<

 that the security for the USDm 300 Bond Issue related to "SS Petrolia" is improved as follows:
(i) To the extent possible, the Guarantor shall provide a first priority assignment of its rights under the Management Agreement with LOG with respect

<<<

 to SS Petrolia, hereinafter referred to as the Petrolia Management Agreement Right Assignment (new security),
(ii) To the extent possible there shall also be put in place a first priority assignment of LOG's rights under the charter contracts

<<<

 with time charterers acknowledged and consented by the time charterer(s) ("Petrolia Charter Agreement Assignment") (new security).
2.2.4. Amended security package for Rig 1 and Rig 2
Subject to acceptance of the proposed amendments by the bondholders

<<<

 under both Bond Loans, Petromena will propose that the security for the USDm 300 Bond Issue is improved to reflect the security package for both the First Priority Debt and the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue related to Rig 1 and Rig 2 to the extent

<<<

 possible, however ranking with third priority in all relevant assets related to the Rig 1 and Rig 2 behind the First Priority Security and the improved security package for the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue respectively.
The current security under

<<<

 the USDm 300 Bond Issue is the following:
1. Share Charge against the shares in the Singapore Subsidiaries on first priority until establishment of the First Priority Security, thereafter on second priority

N O RSK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA

<<<


The following security package is proposed (all other than the Deposit Account Pledge ranking with third priority after the First Priority Security and the security for the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue):
(i) As additional security, the USDm 300 Bond

<<<

 Issue will be secured on third priority in the same security assets as described under 2.1.3. (ii)-(vi) (new security - however, amended security in respect of the Share Charge)
The share charge in Petrorig III will remain unchanged.
Please

<<<

 observe that the security improvement for both Bond Loan Agreements is subject to an inter-creditor agreement being entered into between the Loan Trustee (representing the bondholders) and the lenders under the First Priority Debt; such inter

<<<

 creditor agreement to be on terms and conditions customary for a first priority lender and security holder in international finance transactions, reflecting the waterfall structure.
3. UPDATE ON THE COMPANY
Petromena has provided information

<<<

 regarding the operational and financial status of the Company in the Company Update enclosed to this summons.
4. EVALUATION OE THE PROPOSED CHANGES
Petromena proposes to increase the carve-out amount of First Priority Debt in Petrorig I related

<<<

 to Rig 1 under the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue and the USDm 300 Bond Issue, from USD 200 million to USD 300 million. In relation thereto the Company also proposes a number of changes intended to otherwise improve the security package for the bondholders

<<<

 in these bond issues.
The Company's evaluation of these proposed changes is included in the separate Company Update document. It is the opinion of Petromena that the Bondholders are offered a fair and balanced solution by the proposed amendments

<<<

 to the Bond Loan Agreements. In the Company's opinion, the best available solution for the Company is to acquire additional first priority financing of USD 100 million related to Rig 1 (in total USD 300 million in First Priority Debt) to get

<<<

 Rig 1 delivered and fully financed. Insolvency is a very likely alternative if the amendment proposal is not accepted.
Based on the information given to NTM by the Company based on the Company Update attached, there is a funding-shortfall of

<<<

 approximately USD 100 million for each of Rig 1, Rig 2 and Rig 3. The Company proposes to increase the First Priority Debt related to Rig 1 to cover this shortfall. Further, the Company will extend both Bond Loans' security packages to reflect

<<<

 the security package for the First Priority Debt, to the extent possible, and the waterfall structure in respect of Rig 1 and Rig 2 (the Bondholders should however be aware of the hardening period of such extended security package). In the

<<<

 opinion of NTM, it is necessary for all stakeholders that the

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
Company has a game plan in respect of the shortfall of funding. Taken into account today's challenging debt and equity markets; it is understandable

<<<

 that the Company concentrate on the first rig to be delivered, and it seems that this is the best available solution for all stakeholders. Further, to mirror all creditors' security packages and waterfall structure is a logical and sensible

<<<

 course of action in this situation.
Therefore, NTM recommends the Bondholders to approve the Proposal. Nevertheless, the Bondholders themselves must evaluate, based on all information given from the Company, whether the Proposal should be accepted

<<<

.
It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences of the Proposals. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has challenges going forward and

<<<

 the Company might be unable to meet its commitments in the future.
For further information about the company, please refer to the web site www.petromena.no.
The Company has engaged Pareto Securities AS as the Company's financial advisor with

<<<

 respect to the Proposals. Bondholders may accordingly contact Pareto Securities Fixed Income Sales at +47 22 87 87 70 for further information. Pareto Securities AS is acting solely as advisor for the Company and no-one else in connection with

<<<

 the Proposals. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by Pareto Securities AS with respect to the Company and Pareto Securities expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposals (including

<<<

 but not limited to the information contained herein and in the Company Update).
5. SUMMONS FOR BONDHOLDERS' MEETINGS
