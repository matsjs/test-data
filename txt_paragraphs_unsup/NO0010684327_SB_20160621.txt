Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the "7.5per cent. BassDrill Alpha Ltd. Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2018" - ISIN: NO 001068432.7 (the "Bond Issue"), issued

<<<

 by BassDrill Alpha Ltd, Bermuda (the "Issuer").
All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the bond agreement for the Bond Issue dated 3 July 2013

<<<

 (the "Bond Agreement") or in the restructuring term sheet attached to this Summons as Schedule 1 (the "Restructuring Term Sheet").
The Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to issue this request for a written Bondholders' resolution pursuant

<<<

 to Clause 16.5 (Written Resolution) of the Bond Agreement to consider the approval of the Proposal, as further set out below.
The information in this Summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond

<<<

 Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION
As a result of restructuring discussions the Issuer, the Original Shareholders and an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders

<<<

 who together hold over 61% of the principal amount outstanding of the Bonds (the "Committee") entered into a lock-up agreement with respect to a consensual restructuring of the Issuer's financial indebtedness and capital structure on substantially

<<<

 similar terms to those set out in the Restructuring Term Sheet (the "Restructuring") on 24 May 2016. The Issuer has therefore issued this Summons to propose the Restructuring to the Bondholders. In addition, in order to facilitate the implementation

<<<

 of the Restructuring, the Issuer has requested that the Bondholders further temporarily waive the interest coupon payment and the principal amortisation instalment due 5 April 2016 (which was previously deferred, as more particularly described

<<<

 in the summons to a Bondholders' Meeting dated 29 March 2016), and grant it authority to access a further amount of up to USD 484,640 of restricted cash from the Reserve Account for the sole purpose of funding payment of certain of its upcoming

<<<

 operational expenses pending implementation of the Restructuring, as more particularly described herein.
1

NORDIC TRUSTEE
The Issuer believes that the Restructuring is essential to enable the Issuer to meet its immediate funding requirements

<<<

 and maintain the Issuer as a going concern.
2. SUMMARY OF THE RESTRUCTURING
2.1 Set out below is a summary of key terms of the Restructuring. It is recommended that the Bondholders read the Restructuring Term Sheet in full in order to properly

<<<

 understand the terms of the Restructuring and the Issuer's reasons for proposing it.
2.2 The Restructuring will, in summary, involve the following steps:
(a) The nominal principal amount outstanding and the Maturity Date of the Bonds will remain

<<<

 unchanged, while amortisation payments will be waived and the Fixed Rate under the Bond Agreement will be set at 0% for the period between the Implementation Date (as defined below) and the date on which the Rig is again under a charter contract

<<<

 for offshore services. Any other terms of the Bond Agreement will remain unchanged save as described in Section 4 of the Restructuring Term Sheet (the "Bond Amendments").
(b) The transfer of 85% of the equity ownership in the Issuer from the

<<<

 Original Shareholders to the Bondholders. Such 85% equity stake will be held on behalf of Bondholders through one or more special purpose vehicles (the "Equity Transaction").
(c) The corporate structure immediately following the implementation

<<<

 of the Restructuring is shown in Schedule 3 to this Summons. It is intended that immediately following the implementation of the Restructuring, the post restructuring pro forma equity of NewCo will be held indirectly as follows:
(i) 85% held

<<<

 for the benefit of Bondholders through HoldCo; and
(ii) 15% by Original Shareholders through ShareCo.
(d) The respective board of directors of NewCo and HoldCo will be constituted by representatives of the Bondholders appointed by the Bond

<<<

 Trustee upon a written resolution or a resolution of the Bondholders' Meeting approved by the simple majority of the Voting Bonds. The initial board of directors of NewCo and HoldCo will be constituted by three persons to be determined by the

<<<

 Committee.
(e) Within a period of 3 months after the Implementation Date, HoldCo will issue to Bondholders for no consideration a pro rata allocation of Warrants. Each Warrant will entitle the Warrantholder to receive from HoldCo NewCo Shares

<<<

 for no consideration. The terms of the Warrants are described in more detail in section 8 of the Restructuring Term Sheet.
(f) ShareCo and HoldCo will enter into the Shareholders' Agreement which together with the relevant articles and by-laws

<<<

 will provide for the governance of NewCo. The Shareholders' Agreement will provide, among other things, for drag-along, tag-along and certain minority protection rights as set out in more detail in Appendix 2 of the Restructuring Term Sheet

<<<

.
2

NORDIC TRUSTEE
Implementation of both of the Equity Transaction and the Bond Amendments will be inter-conditional upon implementation of each of them (the date on which these elements have both been implemented being the "Implementation

<<<

 Date").
2.3 The implementation of the Restructuring will be subject to the conditions described in section 9 of the Restructuring Term Sheet.
3. TEMPORARY WAIVER
3.1 The Issuer proposes that the Bondholders temporarily waive the following provisions

<<<

 of the Bond Agreement (the "Payment Waiver"), subject to the Payment Waiver Conditions (as described in further detail below):
(a) payment of the interest and principal instalment payments due on the Interest Payment Date of 5 April 2016 shall

<<<

 be temporarily waived (the "Deferred Payment") until the earlier of (i) the date on which the lock-up agreement dated 24 May 2016 between, inter alia, the Issuer, the Original Shareholders (as defined therein) and the members of the Committee

<<<

 is terminated, (ii) the Implementation Date, or (iii) 30 June 2016 (the "Deferred Payment Date");
(b) the interest amount due and payable on the Deferred Payment shall be calculated based on a period from, and including, the Interest Payment

<<<

 Date on 5 April 2016 to, but excluding, the Deferred Payment Date;
(c) for the period from, and including, the Interest Payment Date on 5 April 2016 to, but excluding, the Deferred Payment Date, the amount of the Deferred Payment will accrue

<<<

 additional default interest of 5% per annum pursuant to Clause 11.5 of the Bond Agreement;
(d) on the occurrence of the Implementation Date any interest that has accrued up until such date will be capitalised by the issuance of additional Bonds

<<<

 (for the avoidance of doubt, such an amount will include ordinary interest payable at a rate of 7.5% per annum, plus additional default interest payable at a rate of 5% per annum);
(e) until the Deferred Payment Date, Clause 13.6(a) (Asset

<<<

 Cover Ratio) of the Bond Agreement shall be temporarily waived, and the requirement for the Issuer to obtain or provide a valuation for the purpose of the definition of Market Value shall be disapplied;
(f) until the Deferred Payment Date,

<<<

 the requirement to transfer funds to the Retention Account shall be temporarily waived; and
(g) the Payment Waiver shall (if applicable) be terminated prior to the Deferred Payment Date on the date that is the earlier of the date on which 

<<<

(i) the Bond Trustee gives written notice of the same to the Issuer with the approval of Bondholders holding a simple majority of the Voting Bonds (whether through written instructions or at a Bondholders' Meeting); or (ii) any of the Payment

<<<

 Waiver Conditions (as described in further detail below) are breached or are not satisfied. In either such event, the Deferred Payment (plus default interest
3

NORDIC TRUSTEE
thereon) shall be immediately due and payable and the Payment Waiver

<<<

 shall immediately cease to be effective.
3.2 The Bond Trustee may, by written notice to the Issuer, terminate the Payment Waiver at any time with immediate effect following its determination that any of the following have occurred:
(a) the

<<<

 Issuer makes any dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders without the prior consent of the Bond Trustee;
(b) the Issuer makes any amendments to existing commercial contracts or enters into any new material commercial

<<<

 contracts which would detriment the Issuer or the Bondholders;
(c) the Issuer enters into any bankruptcy, liquidation, administration, receivership or any other insolvency procedure (or any analogous proceeding in any other jurisdiction), whether

<<<

 voluntary or involuntary;
(d) any enforcement or acceleration action is taken by or on behalf of any other creditors and/or suppliers of the Issuer under or in connection with any other indebtedness or debts of the Issuer;
(e) the Issuer terminates

<<<

 and/or fails to comply with the terms of the fee arrangements with the Bond Trustee's legal advisers; or
(f) the Issuer fails to comply with any of its obligations relating to the Finance Documents, that are not subject to the Payment Waiver

<<<

,
(items (a) to (f) being the "Payment Waiver Conditions").
4. Access to Restricted Cash
4.1 The Issuer currently has no unrestricted cash reserves and restricted cash reserves of USD 7,238,481. Pursuant to a Bondholders' resolution dated 1

<<<

0 May 2016, Bondholders granted the Issuer authority to withdraw up to USD 1,480,787 of restricted cash from the Reserve Account for the sole puiposes of funding certain of its operational expenses falling due for payment up to an including

<<<

 10 June 2016 (the "10 May Permission").
4.2 Since obtaining the 10 May Permission, the Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that it has a further short term liquidity requirement in relation to the period from 10 June 2016 up to 10 July 20

<<<

16.
4.3 In particular, the Issuer has provided to the Bond Trustee, and agreed with the Committee, an updated cash-flow forecast which indicates that aggregate payments of up to USD 1,965,427 are required to be made up to and including 10 July

<<<

 2016 to meet certain of its material upcoming operational expenses, as detailed therein (the "Cash Flow Forecast", and the payments contemplated therein being the "Permitted Payments").
4

NORDIC TRUSTEE
4.4 The Issuer is therefore requesting

<<<

 that the Bondholders grant it authority to withdraw a further amount of up to USD 484,640 of restricted cash from the Reserve Account (for the avoidance of doubt, such an amount being in addition to the USD 1,480,787 of Restricted Cash which

<<<

 the Issuer is authorised to withdraw from the Reserve Account pursuant to the 10 May Permission), for the sole purpose of funding the Permitted Payments as further detailed in the Cash Flow Forecast, as further provided below.
4.5 Payment of

<<<

 the Permitted Payments will secure the ongoing warm-stacking of the BassDrill Alpha tender drilling barge whilst the Issuer and the Bondholders seek to implement the Restructuring.
4.6 Subject to the Bondholders providing the Trustee with satisfactory

<<<

 proof of their holdings of Bonds, the Cash Flow Forecast will be made available for inspection by any Bondholder upon request to the Bond Trustee.
5. THE PROPOSED RESOLUTION
5.1 The Issuer requests that the Bondholders adopt the following resolution

<<<

 (the "Proposed Resolution"):
(a) approve and authorise the implementation of the Restructuring and each element thereof (as described above);
(b) instruct the Bond Trustee (in consultation with its advisers) to do all things and take such steps

(iv) taking any and all steps and actions expressly or impliedly required to be taken or that it would be desirable to take in order to implement the

 Sheet;
5

NORDIC TRUSTEE
(c) instruct and authorise the Bond Trustee to do all things and take such steps as may be necessary to appoint three persons to be determined by the Committee as members of the respective board of directors of NewCo

<<<

 and HoldCo;
(d) agree that the Bond Trustee may at its discretion, in consultation with its advisers, consent to amendments to the terms of the Restructuring Term Sheet on behalf of Bondholders where such amendments (i) are of a minor or technical

(g) waive on the terms set out below, the requirements set forth

<<<

 equals a minimum of USD 5 million, such that this amount may be reduced to USD 3,034,573 for the purpose of making the Permitted Payments (the "Reserve Account Waiver"):
(i) after giving effect to the Reserve Account Waiver, Bondholders agree

<<<

 to permit the Issuer access to funds in the Reserve Account in an aggregate amount of up to USD 1,965,427 for the sole purpose of funding the Permitted Payments (for the avoidance of doubt, such an amount shall include the USD 1,480,787 of

<<<

 restricted cash which the Issuer is already authorised to withdraw from the Reserve Account pursuant to the 10 May Permission);
(ii) the Reserve Account Waiver shall (if applicable) be terminated on the date that is the earlier of the date

<<<

 on which (1) the Bond Trustee gives written notice of the same to the Issuer with the approval of Bondholders holding a simple majority of the Voting Bonds (whether through written instructions or at a Bondholders' Meeting); or (2) the funds

<<<

 in the Reserve Account are used for payments other than Permitted Payments. In either such event, the Reserve Account Waiver shall immediately cease to be effective with respect to any further payments from the Reserve Account; and
(h) agree

<<<

 that the Bond Trustee, in consultation with its advisers, may exercise (or refuse to exercise) any discretion, consent or approval required or contemplated in connection with the matters referred to in this Summons or the Restructuring Term

<<<

 Sheet, and that neither the Bond Trustee nor the
6

NORDIC TRUSTEE
Bondholders shall have any liability whatsoever to any Bondholder or any other person in connection with the exercise (or non-exercise) of any such discretion which is exercised

 in good faith.

Votes which are submitted are final and cannot be withdrawn. In the event that

 the Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after voting is conducted, the new Bondholders shall accordingly not be entitled to vote.

The fixed number of individual directors of NewCo shall be three (or otherwise if so directed by tax advisors).
All matters at directors' meetings other than Shareholder

<<<

 Reserved Matters shall be decided by a simple majority of directors. In the event that the number of votes for and against a particular proposal at a meeting of the directors is equal, the chairman of the board of directors shall have a casting

<<<

 vote. The approval of any Shareholder Reserved Matter (as defined below) relating to NewCo or the Company, or their subsidiaries (if any), shall require the approval of (i) shareholders of NewCo holding at least 66.67% of the NewCo Shares present

<<<

 and voting in an extraordinary general meeting, or (ii) a written resolution by shareholders of NewCo holding at least 66.67% of the outstanding NewCo Shares.
Any proposed alteration of the votes or economic rights attached to the NewCo Shares

<<<

 which would impose a detrimental economic or voting effect on some of the NewCo Shares (for these purposes, the "Minority Shares") relative to the remainder of the NewCo Shares (for these purposes, the "Majority Shares") without offering pro

<<<

 rata participation in the Majority Shares to all shareholders of NewCo, will also be a Shareholder Reserved Matter with an approval level set of "at least 90%" rather than "at least 66.67%"
If, in one or a series of related transactions, one

<<<

 or more shareholders of NewCo propose to transfer (the "Selling Party") in aggregate 66.67% or more of all NewCo Shares to any person (the "Proposed Transfer") such Selling Party shall, before making a Proposed Transfer, procure that the proposed

<<<

 transferee makes an offer to any other shareholder of NewCo to purchase all the NewCo Shares held by it for a consideration in cash per share that is at least equal to the highest price per share offered or paid by the proposed transferee in

<<<

 the Proposed Transfer.
A Proposed Transfer that involves a transfer to a person that is in any way directly or indirectly related to any of (i) the shareholders of NewCo, (ii) the Bondholders, or (iii) the shareholders of ShareCo, will not

<<<

 qualify as a Proposed Transfer as provided in this section 2.
Subject to section 3 below, if a shareholder accepts the offer made by the proposed transferee, it shall (i) provide warranties and indemnities to
17

NORDIC TRUSTEE

<<<

 (the "Called Parties") to sell and transfer all their respective NewCo Shares (the "Called Shares") to the Proposed Buyer (or as the Proposed Buyer directs) in accordance with the shareholders' agreement and the constitutional documents of

<<<

 NewCo.
A transfer of NewCo Shares that involves a Proposed Buyer that is in any way directly or indirectly related to any of (i) the shareholders of NewCo, (ii) the Bondholders, or (iii) the shareholders of ShareCo, will not qualify as a transfer

<<<

 as provided in this section 3.
Each of the Called Parties shall (i) provide the Proposed Buyer with warranties and indemnities in relation to the title and unencumbered nature of the Called Shares, under equal terms as provided by the Selling

<<<

 Party, provided that a Called Party will be liable towards the Proposed Buyer in case of breach up to a maximum of 50% of the net proceeds of the relevant Called Party derived from the transfer, and (ii) shall compensate the Selling Party for

<<<

 such Called Party's proportionate share (based on its shareholding) of any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Selling Party in implementing such transfer (or pro rata portion thereof), up to a maximum amount of USD 5,000 for every

<<<

 1% of equity in NewCo that is held by the Called Party.

<<<

 sold in connection with the Exit) shall be liquidated and all monies remaining in NewCo (after payment of the
