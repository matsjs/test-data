8 with Call and Warrants

Oslo, 14 July 2008
Request for postponing the Maturity Date - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned Bond issue (the "Loan") where

<<<

 Saga Oil ASA is the borrower (the "Borrower"). The terms and conditions of the Loan are set out in a loan agreement dated 12 July 2006 (the "Loan Agreement") between the Borrower and the Loan Trustee. All capitalised terms used herein shall

<<<

 have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement or in this summons unless otherwise stated.

Background
The Borrower has informed the Loan Trustee that it will not have sufficient funds to repay the entire Loan at the Maturity Date

<<<

 which is 14 July 2008.
The Borrower is in the process of raising additional equity through an equity offering (the "Equity Issue") which will, if successful, enable Saga Oil ASA to repay the Loan. The equity issue is scheduled to be completed

<<<

 medio October 2008.
To secure operations until additional equity can be raised, the Borrower plans to raise a minimum of NOK 15,000,000 through subordinated notes (the "Subordinated Bridge Financing") before 29 August 2008 (the "Milestone Date

<<<

"). The Subordinated Bridge Financing") shall be subordinated to the Loan, and shall not be serviced or mature before the Loan is repaid in full. The proceeds shall be used as working capital and to finance a thorough review of the Borrowers

<<<

 operations and reserve base (the "Review"). The results of the Review, which is expected to be completed medio October, will be essential to the execution of the Equity Issue.
Furthermore, Saga Oil ASA has a credit facility with the Norwegian

<<<

 bank SR Bank (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility contains provisions which, if the postponement of the Maturity Date of the Loan is not accepted, may lead to the Credit Facility being declared in default. Saga Oil does at this point

<<<

 not have sufficient funds to repay the entire Credit Facility.

The proposal
The Borrower proposes due to its current financial situation, to postpone the Maturity Date of the Loan until 31 October 2008 (the "New

<<<

 Maturity Date"). Further, it is proposed that the Interest Payment o f the Loan due on 14 July 2008 instead o f being paid on the 14 July 2008, interest shall accrue on the interest amount with the increased coupon described below, from the

<<<

 Maturity Date until the Loan is repaid. The Loan including accrued interest shall be due on the New Maturity Date.
In order to protect the Bondholders position in the time period up until the Loan is repaid, the Borrower shall, if the postponement

<<<

 of the Maturity Date is accepted, be subject to the following covenants.
1) The Borrower shall, within the Milestone Date, raise a minimum o f NOK 15,000,000 of Subordinated Bridge Financing either through issuing subordinated notes, or other

<<<

 issue, which is subordinated to the Loan and shall not be serviced or mature before the Loan is repaid in full.This means the Loan can be declared in default and due earlier than the New Maturity Date in the event that the Borrower fails to

<<<

 raise the funds necessary to complete the planned Review.
2) To avoid the Bondholders position being weakened by new debt, servicing of debt or new encumbrances over the assets of the Borrower, the Borrower shall not: a) create any new indebtedness

<<<

 with equal or better seniority to the Loan, b) repay or service any of the Borrowers financial debt before the Loan and accrued interest is repaid in full, and c) create, or permit to exist, any encumbrances over its assets, hereunder create

<<<

 any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or other similar encumbrances.
Failure by the Borrower to comply with one or more of the above covenants shall constitute an Event of Default, and the entire Remaining Loan including accrued interest

<<<

 and expenses can be declared in default and due for immediate payment.
The Borrower offers the following compensation to the Bonholders if the proposal is adopted by the Bondholders' meeting.
1) The coupon o f the Loan is increased with 5%

<<<

 p.a. from 12% p.a. to 17% p.a. in order to equal the interest rate that Bondholders are entitled to under the Loan Agreement in events of late payment. The increase shall have effect from and including 14 June 2008 until the Loan is repaid

<<<

 in full.
2) Further the Borrower offers to increase the redemption price from 100% to 103% of par.

<<<

N O RSK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
The proposal involves postponing

<<<

 the Maturity Date for a considerable period o f time, and does involve certain risks of the Bondholders. The requirement of successfully having the Subordinated Bridge Financing paid in by the Milestone Date does reduce the risk to some degree

<<<

, although there is still a considerable period of time left from the Milestone Date to the New Maturity Date. On the other hand it can seem prudent to allow time for a thorough review of the operations and reserves o f the Borrower to create

<<<

 basis for the planned Equity Issue. The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
