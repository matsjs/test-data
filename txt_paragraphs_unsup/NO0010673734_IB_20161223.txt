Company update
As reported earlier, Sea Trucks Group Limited (the "Company") is currently addressing challenging industry conditions. The Company is currently engaged in ongoing and constructive discussions

 with an `ad hoc' committee of Bondholders (the "Bondholder Committee") representing a majority of the outstanding bonds under the USD 575 million Senior Secured Bond Issue 2013/2018 with ISIN NO 001 0673734 (the "Bond Issue"). The amount currently

<<<

 outstanding under the Bond Issue is USD 456 million.
In light of industry conditions and following consultation with the Bondholder Committee, the Company has now determined that it will not make the interest payment which is due on 27 December

 2016 under the terms of the Bond Issue. As part of their discussions, the Company and the Bondholder Committee have reached an agreement in principle on the terms of a standstill on action by Bondholders against the Company. The standstill

<<<

 would apply to any default arising under the terms of the Bond Agreement, including any non payment of interest or scheduled amortisation payments (the "Standstill").
On the basis of the in principle agreement with the Bondholder Committee

<<<

, the Company will shortly issue a summons for a Bondholder meeting at which the Company will seek the formal approval of the Bondholders for the Standstill, and also for certain other technical amendments to the terms of the Bond Agreement

<<<

. The Standstill will become effective if it is approved by holders of a majority of the Bonds voting at that meeting. The Company understands that the members of the Bondholder Committee intend to vote in favour of the Standstill proposal at

<<<

 that meeting.
The summons to the Bondholder meeting, which includes the Standstill proposal, will be published on www.stamdata.no, the information service of the trustee in the Bond Issue, Nordic Trustee.
