RISK FACTORS
Before making an investment decision, prospective investors should carefully review the specific risk factors described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Prospectus. The Issuer and the Guarantor believe

<<<

 that the following factors may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes and the Guarantor's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Guarantee. Most of these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur

<<<

 and neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor is in a position to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. Citycon's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by each of these

<<<

 risks presented. Also other risks and uncertainties not described herein could affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes or the Guarantor's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Guarantee. Additional risks

<<<

 and uncertainties not presently known to the Issuer or the Guarantor, or that the Issuer or the Guarantor currently believe are immaterial, could impair the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under the Notes or the ability of the

<<<

 Guarantor to fulfil its obligations under the Guarantee. Certain other matters regarding the operations of the Guarantor and the Issuer that should be considered before making an investment in the Notes are set out, in the sections "Description

<<<

 of the Guarantor" and "Description of the Issuer", among other places. The order of presentation of the risk factors in this Prospectus is not intended to be an indication of the probability of their occurrence or of their potential effect

<<<

 on the ability of the Guarantor to fulfil its obligations under the Guarantee or the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes.
Factors that May Affect the Issuer's Ability to Fulfil its Obligations under the Notes
At the date

<<<

 of this Prospectus, the Issuer's principal purpose is to provide funding to entities within the Group. Therefore, the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes is entirely dependent on the Guarantor's financial performance

<<<

. The Issuer is subject to all the risks to which the Guarantor is subject, to the extent that such risks could limit the Guarantor's ability to satisfy in full and on a timely basis its obligations under the Guarantee.
Risks Relating to Citycon

<<<

's Operating Environment
Economic Fluctuations and Economic Development Have an Adverse Effect on the Real Estate Market and therefore to Citycon's Business and Results of Operations.
The real estate market, demand for retail and other premises

<<<

, rent levels, occupancy rate, and tenants' ability to pay the rent are significantly affected by economic fluctuations and developments, making them potential risks for Citycon. Economic trends, particularly factors affecting consumer confidence

<<<

 and behaviour, also influence the demand for retail premises.
In 2014, the European economy slowly started to recover as the sovereign debt tensions eased. Economic growth levels in 2015 and prospects for 2016 vary in Citycon's key markets

<<<

. The economy is expected to grow slowly in Finland and in Denmark in 2016 whereas in Sweden and in Estonia the economic growth is expected to stay on a moderate level. In Norway, GDP is expected to continue to grow but since the Norwegian economy

<<<

 is highly exposed to oil prices, low oil prices may have a negative effect on the GDP's growth prospects. In Finland, challenging economic outlook is expected to have an adverse effect on Citycon's business and results of operations in the

<<<

 near future.
The changes in national and local economics have an effect on the real estate market, and in particular on rent levels and occupancy rates. More specifically, actual inflation has a direct effect on the rent levels. Most of Citycon

<<<

's leases are based on agreements whereby the rental rate is determined by (i) the capital rent tied to the cost-of-living index; and (ii) the maintenance fee, which is charged separately from the lessee and is used to cover operating expenses

<<<

 incurred by the property owner relating to property maintenance. Thus, the development of rental income levels is for the most part strongly dependent on inflation rate developments. Citycon also has turnover-based lease agreements, where the

<<<

 total rent is split between (i) the capital rent based on the turnover of the tenant; and (ii) the maintenance fee. Turnover-based lease agreements normally also include a minimum rent, which is tied to the cost-of-living index and corresponds

<<<

 to the market rent level. At the end of 2014, turnover-based lease agreements accounted for 53 per cent. (52 per cent. at the end of 2013) of Citycon's lease portfolio, whereas only approximately 2.0 per cent. (1.3 per cent. at the end of the

<<<

 year 2013) of rental income actually came from the turnover-based element of these leases. During the past years, almost all
1

new leases signed in shopping centres were turnover-based, with a minimum fixed rent. Citycon's economic occupancy

<<<

 rate and average rent remained relatively stable in 2014 as compared to 2013, attributable to increased leasing efforts.
Periods of weak economic growth or recession and unfavourable real estate market conditions could reduce demand for Citycon

<<<

's retail and other premises, occupancy rates and rent levels. Even though retail trade has developed positively since 2010, there are many threats as regards the European economy that may change this development and, therefore, there are no

<<<

 guarantees that Citycon will in the future be able to maintain the present high degree of occupancy and rental rates of the properties owned by it. The economic occupancy rate of Citycon's portfolio was approximately 96.3 per cent. at the end

<<<

 of 2014 (95.7 per cent. at the end of 2013), when Citycon's economic occupancy rate in Finland was approximately 95.6 per cent., in Sweden approximately 96.1 per cent. and approximately 99.3 per cent. in the Baltic Countries and New Business

<<<

. The economic occupancy rate of Citycon's property portfolio was approximately 96.0 per cent. on 30 June 2015. Further, Citycon has major (re)development projects in progress throughout its operating countries and once all of these projects

<<<

 are completed, the leasable area within Citycon's shopping centres will increase significantly. Planned leasing of the respective new retail premises is of primary importance with regard to Citycon's financial development and growth. Adverse

<<<

 changes in rent levels, failures in renting new business premises or the loss of key tenants and subsequent decreases in occupancy rates could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition

<<<

.
The Imbalance of the Euro Area Could Have a Material Impact on Citycon's Business.
All of the countries in which Citycon currently operates are member states of the EU, except Norway, which is a member state of the European Economic Area 

<<<

(EEA), and Finland and Estonia also belong to the European Monetary Union (EMU) and have, therefore, adopted the euro as their currency. Financial risks related to the euro area and its member states may affect Citycon's operating environment

<<<

 either directly or indirectly through the common currency and monetary policy. The prolonged and deep fiscal deficits, high indebtedness and unemployment rate in certain EMU member states constitute significant economic challenges. The normalisation

<<<

 of the imbalances arisen in the economy of the euro area requires active measures from the EMU countries and the European Central Bank, and achieving decisions and their effectiveness involve significant uncertainty. If the imbalances concerning

<<<

 the euro area cannot be solved to a sufficient extent and confidence in the public economy of the euro area cannot be restored, this may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition. For

<<<

 further information on currency risks, please see "-- Financing Risks Relating to Citycon's Business--Citycon Is Exposed to Fluctuations in Exchange Rates".
The Fair Value of Citycon's Investment Properties May Fluctuate.
The fair value of

<<<

 investment properties, and market price levels are influenced by several factors, such as general and local economic conditions, interest rates, inflation expectations, GDP growth, private consumption, market rent levels, vacancy rates, property

<<<

 investors' yield requirements, and competition.
In addition, city planning and building projects, as well as changes in competitive dynamics, may influence the value of properties. Citycon uses the fair value model in the valuation of its investment

<<<

 properties, whereupon fair value changes (i.e. fair value gains and losses) of investment properties are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income (IAS 40). Additional information on the changes in the fair value of Citycon's investment

<<<

 properties can be found in "Citycon's Property Portfolio in Brief and Investments, Divestments and Development Projects". On 25 May 2015, Citycon Norway AS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citycon, entered into a share purchase agreement (the

<<<

 Share Purchase Agreement) governing the acquisition (the Acquisition) of all the outstanding shares in the Norwegian shopping centre company Sektor Gruppen AS (Sektor). Following the Acquisition Sektor became a group company of Citycon. Sektor

<<<

 is at the date of this Prospectus not required to apply IFRS and thus prepares its financial statements in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and NGAAP. One of the implications is that the properties are accounted for at historical

<<<

 cost less accumulated depreciation instead of fair value. For further information on the NGAAP, please see "Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information--Sektor Unaudited Historical Financial Information According to IFRS". From 30 September 

<<<

2015, Citycon will include Sektor's financial information in its consolidated interim reports and financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
2

Citycon has recognised fair value gains on its investment properties in each year between

<<<

 2012 and 2014. Changes in the fair value of the investment properties impact Citycon's statement of comprehensive income and statement of financial position of Citycon, but they do not have a direct effect on the cash flow statement. Significant

<<<

 fair value losses of the investment properties could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Property Valuation Statements Are Inherently Subjective Assessments of External Property

<<<

 Appraisers.
There are uncertainties relating to valuation statements prepared by external property appraisers due to the lack of liquidity of real estate assets and, among other factors, the nature of each property, its location, the expected

<<<

 future rental income from that particular property and the valuation methodology used to asses that property's value. This is especially true when there are few or no comparison sales. In addition, property appraisals are based on assumptions

<<<

 that may prove erroneous. Property appraisers make certain assumptions on the future development of the real estate market, such as market yields and market rents. Any erroneous assumptions used as a basis for appraisals or deficient appraisals

<<<

 may result in appraisals materially deviating from the market price of a property site and may thus have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The estimated value of Sektor's real estate

<<<

 property value represented in this Prospectus is based on the situation on 31 December 2014 and has not been updated since.
Real estate valuations are based on certain assumptions and methods that are not only subject to change but are also

<<<

 inherently subjective and uncertain, hence the values in the appraisal reports contained in the Prospectus or in other Company documents, may not accurately reflect the value of the real estate at which they may be sold.
Tenant Sales and Demand

<<<

 for Citycon's Retail Premises May Be Adversely Affected by Decreasing Private Consumption.
Private consumption has a material effect on the sales of Citycon's tenants and, hence, on the demand for Citycon's retail premises. Growth in retail

<<<

 sales is mainly dependent on economic development, increases in household purchasing power and growth in consumer spending. In 2014, retail sales grew in all the countries in which Citycon currently operates, except Finland. Challenges in retail

<<<

 in Finland caused a 4.0 per cent. decrease in rents in the renewed lease agreements to Citycon's whole property portfolio in the six month period ended 30 June 2015. In 2014, the growth rate of retail sales (excluding motorcycles and vehicles

<<<

) was -2.1 per cent. in Denmark, 3.4 per cent. in Sweden, 6.0 per cent. in Estonia, but in Finland, inflation-adjusted retail sales declined by -1.0 per cent. During 2014, household consumer confidence remained positive in Finland, Denmark and

<<<

 Sweden and above the euro area's average in all of Citycon's current countries of operation. In contrast, the household consumer confidence indicator in Estonia was negative in 2014.1
Citycon recently entered the Norwegian market through its

<<<

 acquisition of Sektor. In Norway, the annual growth rate of inflation-adjusted retail sales (excluding motorcycles and other vehicles) in 2014 was 1.7 per cent.2
Weakness in the European economy may further decrease consumer confidence and

<<<

 affect consumption. Should growth in private consumption slowdown in Citycon's geographic markets, this could lead to decreased demand for retail premises. Lower tenant demand may negatively affect the rental and vacancy levels in Citycon's

<<<

 portfolio, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Concentrated Property Portfolio and Dependency upon Retail Sales Expose Citycon to Local and IndustryRelated

<<<

 Risks.
In accordance with Citycon's strategy, Citycon's property portfolio is concentrated and consists almost entirely of retail properties, the majority of which are currently located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. Citycon's largest tenant

<<<

 groups are specialty and grocery store chains, but also cafés and restaurants, banks and financial

institutions and municipalities and other public administration tenants. The fair

<<<

 value of Citycon's investment properties totalled approximately EUR 2,819.6 million on 30 June 2015, before the Acquisition, with Finnish properties accounting for approximately 61 per cent., Swedish properties for approximately 26 per cent

<<<

. and properties in the Baltic Countries and New Business unit for approximately 12 per cent. of the total fair value. Based on pro forma financial information as of 31 December 2014, as a result of the Acquisition, of Citycon's investment properties

<<<

, Finland will account for approximately 41 per cent., Norway for approximately 34 per cent., Sweden for approximately 17 per cent. and the Baltic Countries and New Business unit for approximately 8 per cent. As Citycon's current property portfolio

<<<

 is currently concentrated on commercial properties in the major cities in Finland, Sweden and Norway, Citycon's business depends highly on the positive development of retail trade in Finland, Sweden and Norway. For economic risks related to

<<<

 Citycon's business, please see "-- Risks Relating to Citycon's Operating Environment--Economic Fluctuations and Economic Development Have an Adverse Effect on the Real Estate Market and therefore to Citycon's Business and Results of Operations

<<<

".
Citycon's high level of concentration in retail property and its dependency on the Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Estonian, and Norwegian retail trade constitute risks for Citycon's business and may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's

<<<

 business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Increasing Internet Commerce May Have an Adverse Effect on Shopping Centre Sales and Decrease Demand for Commercial Retail Premises.
The retail industry continues to transform as internet

<<<

 commerce grows and consumers increasingly shop online. The growth of internet commerce and new competitive retail schemes affect the demand for commercial retail premises by new and existing tenants. Shopping centres will need to adapt their

<<<

 services and tenant offerings to meet changing consumer behaviour and demand to continue to attract customers in the future. Citycon aims to adapt its operations to the effects of increasing internet commerce by focusing on urban grocery- and

<<<

 necessityanchored shopping centres in growing cities that offer restaurants and services, as well as by utilising social media in daily operations. A significant increase in internet shopping could, however, decrease shopping centre sales and

<<<

 the demand for commercial retail premises, which could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Increased Competition in the Real Estate Market May Have an Adverse Effect on Citycon

<<<

's Business and Its Growth Opportunities.
The Nordic and Baltic real estate markets are characterised by increasing competition from international real estate investors. Citycon expects new real estate investors to continue to enter these markets

<<<

 in the future. Transaction volumes in the Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian property markets increased strongly during 2014, especially towards the end of the year. The Danish property market remained stable with some increase in 2014.3
Highly

<<<

 liquid real estate markets usually decrease yield requirements and increase real estate prices, whereas slow and illiquid markets usually increase yield requirements which leads to lower real estate prices. There is currently a strong demand

<<<

 for prime properties while the demand for secondary properties is weaker.4 In addition, the slow rate of planning may have a limiting effect on the building of new retail properties or extensions of already existing retail properties. This

<<<

 development, combined with the entry of new international investors on the local markets, may make it more challenging for Citycon to acquire new properties and could weaken Citycon's market share and growth possibilities. In the short term

<<<

 this might lead to increasing property prices and value of Citycon's portfolio, while in the longer term this could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon aims to further

<<<

 improve its business and profits by redeveloping and expanding its current properties, by acquiring new shopping centres for further development and by carrying on active shopping centre management. There are, however, no guarantees that Citycon

<<<

 will be able to maintain its market share and continue to benefit from its current position. Increased competition in the Nordic and Baltic real estate markets could weaken

 in increased competition for tenants, particularly in the largest urban areas. This may increase marketing costs incurred by real estate owners and managers, make it more challenging to attract and retain tenants at commercially satisfactory

<<<

 rental rates and increase the vacancy rate. As a result, the need for tenant-specific alteration work and incentives to accommodate tenants' needs may increase. Any significant increase in marketing costs and tenant incentives and related investments

<<<

, or the impact from difficulties in attracting and retaining suitable tenants, could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon's Planned Growth May Be Affected by Competition

<<<

 Regulation and Authority Decisions in Relation to Executing Its (Re)development Projects.
In Finland, Citycon is a market leader in the shopping centre business measured by leasable retail area and is currently the only property investment

<<<

 company specialising exclusively in shopping centres. In Sweden, Citycon is one of the top-three players in the shopping centre market.5 Citycon owns two of the largest shopping centres in Tallinn, Estonia, Rocca al Mare and Kristiine, making

<<<

 it a market leader in that city. Through the Acquisition, Citycon has entered the Norwegian market. As Citycon acquires properties and increases its market share, compliance with competition regulations may be subject to challenge. It is possible

<<<

 that competition authorities could rule that certain future acquisitions are anti-competitive, which may limit Citycon's ability to further grow through acquisitions.
Citycon has new (re)development projects under consideration. All projects

<<<

 under consideration may change or be cancelled, for example due to circumstances relating to city planning and zoning. Public authorities, such as municipality authorities, are empowered to develop plans for the use of land. Development projects

<<<

 require close contacts with those authorities. Citycon's business depends on cooperation with authorities empowered with regulatory responsibility relating to Citycon's business. Adverse proceedings with authorities could have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on the possibility to start development projects, or on the progress of the development projects and therefore on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition. See also "--Risks Relating to the Acquisition and Sektor

<<<

's Business--Entry into a New Market Area May Involve Regulatory and Compliance Risks".
Possible Legislative Changes May Cause Unpredictable Adjustment Costs or Increased Tax Burden, and Possible Changes in the International Financial Reporting

<<<

 Standards May Affect Accounting Principles of Citycon's Financial Statements.
Citycon's operations are regulated by the legislation of each country in which Citycon operates. In addition, Citycon's operations may be affected by regional or

<<<

 supranational regulations, such as EU legislation. Citycon's management believes that Citycon complies in all material respects with legislative requirements and other regulations as at the date of this Prospectus. Legislation and other regulations

<<<

 may, however, change, and Citycon cannot guarantee that it would in such cases be able to comply, without significant measures and expenses, with the requirements of changed legislation or other regulations. For example, changes in law and

<<<

 regulations or their interpretation or application practices concerning property, land use, development, zoning, health, safety, stability requirements, tenants and rents, environmental protection, labour and taxation may have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on Citycon's operations. Additionally, environmentally oriented regulation and the level of industry best practices increase continuously. Such changes may adversely affect Citycon's ability to use certain real estate assets as initially

<<<

 intended and could also cause Citycon to incur increased capital expenditure or running costs to ensure compliance with the new applicable laws or regulations, which may not be entirely offset by the rental income.

Tax law and regulations and their interpretation or application practices related to tax deductibility of

<<<

 interest expenses may be subject to change in the countries in which Citycon operates. Citycon monitors and analyses the impact of such changes as part of its normal operations. Taxable income is subject to uncertainty, and the final amount

<<<

 of taxes may deviate from the originally recorded amount. If the final amount of taxes deviates from the originally recorded amounts, such differences may affect the period's taxable profit, tax receivables or liabilities as well as deferred

<<<

 tax assets or liabilities. As Citycon prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, changes in international accounting standards may affect Citycon's accounting policies and, therefore, such changes may have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on Citycon's results of operations for the financial period.
Adapting Citycon's operations to any of the changes described above may result in additional costs for Citycon that are difficult to anticipate or increased tax burden

<<<

, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Risks Relating to the Acquisition and Sektor's Business
Citycon May Not Be Able to Refinance Certain Financing Arrangements

<<<

 Related to the Acquisition as Planned.
Citycon intends to refinance the bank bridge financing facilities drawn in an amount of EUR 222 million and Sektor's existing bank financing facilities of NOK 5,584 million drawn to finance the Acquisition

<<<

 before such bank financing facilities fall due in June 2016 and April 2016, respectively. Citycon intends to raise the funds required for the refinancing through, among others, proceeds obtained from potential divestments of non-core assets

<<<

, bond issuances and bank debt, if needed. Citycon's identified non-core portfolio amounts to approximately EUR 300 million, which management expects to divest during the coming years.
If Citycon is not able to divest its properties as planned

<<<

 or if placing of potential bonds fails, Citycon may not be able to refinance Sektor's financing arrangements and repay or refinance its bridge financing as planned, which would result in a breach by Citycon of its other financing arrangements

<<<

 either due to the expiry of the temporary waiver obtained for Sektor bank financing or due to the failure to repay the bridge financing resulting in crossdefaults under Citycon's other financing arrangements enabling lenders and holders of

<<<

 outstanding bonds to require premature repayment of debt owed to them. Failure to obtain sufficient financing or to refinance its funding in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations,

<<<

 and financial condition.
The Integration of Sektor's Business into Citycon's Business Might Not Be Successful as Planned.
Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition will depend largely on the timely and efficient integration of Sektor

<<<

's business into Citycon. The process of integrating Sektor, such as the integration of corporate culture and IT and reporting systems, requires time and effort and involves certain risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that Citycon

<<<

 will be able to integrate Sektor's business in the manner or within the timeframe currently anticipated.
As Sektor was a private company, bringing its financial and other reporting systems up to the level required for a subsidiary of a listed

<<<

 company is of great importance and requires significant management effort. Sektor has previously only reported its financial information in accordance with NGAAP, whereas going forward, Citycon will need to include Sektor's financial information

<<<

 in its consolidated interim reports and financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The anticipated benefits expected to arise from the Acquisition and the integration of Sektor into Citycon's existing business as well as related

<<<

 costs are derived from Citycon's estimates and such estimates are inherently uncertain. The estimates included in this Prospectus are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to Citycon and Citycon's management

<<<

's judgments based on such information, including, without limitation, information relating to the business operations, financial condition and results of operations of Sektor. While Citycon believes these estimated synergy benefits and related

<<<

 costs are reasonable, the underlying assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially

<<<

 from those contained in the synergy benefit and related cost estimates.
6

Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Citycon will not encounter difficulties in integrating Sektor or that Citycon will achieve anticipated synergies or other

<<<

 benefits from the integration. Furthermore, adverse developments in general economic conditions could limit, eliminate or delay Citycon's ability to realise the anticipated benefits. Any delays and unexpected costs incurred in the integration

<<<

 process or failure to achieve the goals, in time or at all, may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Please see also "--Risks Relating to Citycon and Its Business--The Ability

<<<

 to Integrate Acquired Targets Successfully Is a Requirement to Meet Citycon's Targets for Growth in Profitability".
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is not Necessarily Indicative of Citycon's Future Results.
This Prospectus contains

<<<

 unaudited pro forma financial information, which is based on preliminary estimates and assumptions made by Citycon that Citycon deems to be reasonable and is being furnished solely for illustrative purposes. The unaudited pro forma financial

<<<

 information included in this Prospectus does not necessarily fully reflect what the business, financial condition and results of operations of Citycon would have been had Sektor been part of Citycon as at the relevant date or during the relevant

<<<

 period and is not necessarily indicative of the business, financial condition, or results of operations of Citycon at any future date or for any future period. In the past, Citycon and Sektor have operated their respective businesses separately

<<<

. Citycon and Sektor do not have prior history as a combined entity and there are no consolidated financial statements available for them. Citycon applies IFRS whereas Sektor has prepared its financial statements in accordance with NGAAP. Accordingly

<<<

, the preparation of the pro forma financial information for the purposes of this Prospectus required the aggregation of the financial information of Citycon and Sektor and adjustments reflecting the differences in the accounting policies applied

<<<

 by Citycon and Sektor as well as in the presentation of the financial information of Citycon and Sektor. See also "Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information" for more detailed description of the basis for preparation and limitations in preparation

<<<

 of pro forma financial information.
Citycon expects to publish its first consolidated interim report including Sektor's financial information for the nine months ending 30 September 2015 and the first consolidated financial statements including

<<<

 Sektor's financial information for the year ending 31 December 2015.
As a result, an investor should not place undue reliance on the unaudited pro forma financial information presented in this Prospectus.
Citycon May Not Be Adequately Protected

<<<

 Against Possible Known or Unknown Deficiencies and Liabilities of Sektor.
Acquisitions are subject to a number of risks relating to the assessment of the acquired business, including its value, strengths, weaknesses, potential profitability

<<<

, assets and liabilities. The due diligence review that Citycon performed on Sektor may have failed to identify and discover potential liabilities and deficiencies, including legal claims and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws

<<<

; claims for breach of contract; employment related claims; environmental liabilities, conditions and contamination; tax liabilities; and other liabilities (whether or not contingent). As Citycon integrates Sektor's business, Citycon may learn

<<<

 additional information about such liabilities which, individually or in aggregate, could result in significant future additional costs and liabilities that are not described in this Prospectus and have a material adverse effect on Citycon's

<<<

 business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In the Share Purchase Agreement, the Sellers have given certain representations and warranties regarding Sektor and committed to indemnity clauses in Citycon's favour and Citycon has

<<<

 conducted certain due diligence on Sektor in connection with the Transaction. Even if Citycon had been able to identify all of Sektor's liabilities and deficiencies accurately and to their full extent, the Share Purchase Agreement does not

<<<

 contain sufficient indemnity clauses or other contractual protections against all or part of every known liability or deficiency.
Citycon's ability to recover any amounts in respect of the Seller's representations, warranties and indemnity

<<<

 clauses, as well as certain covenants set out in the Share Purchase Agreement, is subject to certain minimum thresholds and time limitations, as well as to a maximum amount. Citycon may incur losses below the minimum thresholds or in excess

<<<

 of such maximum amount and the matters giving rise to the losses may not be recoverable against the warranties or indemnity clauses or at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and

<<<

 financial condition. Although the shareholders of the
7

Sellers have guaranteed certain of the Sellers' liabilities under the Share Purchase Agreement, no assurance can be made that a valid claim under the Share Purchase Agreement could be

<<<

 successfully enforced and collected by Citycon.
Entry into a New Market Area May Involve Regulatory and Compliance Risks.
As a result of the Acquisition, Citycon entered a new geographical market area, Norway. Compliance with applicable Norwegian

<<<

 laws and regulations may cause additional regulatory burden for Citycon and result in increased work and expenses. For example, the Norwegian national policy provision for shopping centres adopted in 2008 states that shopping centres can only

<<<

 be established or expanded in accordance with approved country plans or country sub-plans with guidelines for localisation of retail trade and other service functions (the National Policy Provision). For areas not covered by such a plan, establishing

<<<

 new shopping centres or expanding existing shopping centres with a total floor space of more than 3,000 sq.m. is not permitted. The local municipality cannot approve the development of shopping centres beyond the scope of the regional plan

<<<

, regardless of whether the municipality supports the development. The national provisions may also prevent organic growth through expansion of Sektor's existing shopping centres that are situated in such areas. Compliance with or any failure

<<<

 to comply with applicable Norwegian laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Please see also "--Risks Relating to Citycon and Its Business--The Expansion

<<<

 of Citycon's Business into New Geographical Areas May Introduce Additional Risks".
Risks Relating to the Formal Title to Property Being Separated from Beneficial Ownership of Property.
The formal title to a smaller part of Stovner Senter, a

<<<

 shopping centre of which Sektor owns 20 per cent., is held by a third party, which exposes Sektor to a risk of the creditors of the third party and previous owners of the property seizing the property. Furthermore, if a third party successor

<<<

 of the property acquires the property in good faith from the title holding company, such third party may claim rights to the property, which would mean that Sektor Stovner Eiendom AS (owner of Stovner Senter) would lose the property in question

<<<

, depending on the nature and extent of such claim. In the Share Purchase Agreement, the Sellers have agreed that from the signing date and until the closing date they will, without undue delay, use their reasonable best endeavors to procure

<<<

 that the relevant titles are transferred to Sektor Stovner Eiendom AS.
For shopping centres Buskerud Storsenter and Magasinet Drammen the formal title for the properties is separated in so called title holder companies wholly owned by Sektor

<<<

, whose sole purpose is to hold the title of the relevant property. Due to this investment structure, creditors of previous owners of the properties could seize the property, which would mean that Sektor loses the beneficial ownership of the

<<<

 properties in question.
If a third party successfully claims rights to the properties, this could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Please see "--Risks Relating to the Acquisition

<<<

 and Sektor's Business--Citycon May Not Be Adequately Protected Against Possible Known or Unknown Deficiencies and Liabilities of Sektor".
Risks Relating to Citycon and Its Business
Citycon's (Re)development Projects May Fail.
Citycon aims to

<<<

 further improve its operations and profits by (re)developing and refurbishing its existing properties. Citycon's property development projects are subject to the risks usually attributable to construction projects, which include: (i) delays

<<<

 in construction work or other unforeseeable delays, (ii) cost overruns, (iii) lack of demand for the new or (re)developed leased premises and (iv) planning and zoning risk. Should any of Citycon's significant (re)development projects prove

<<<

 to be unsuccessful, this may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Increase in Costs Relating to Operational Activities and Investments or Potential Damage During Construction

<<<

 Could Have a Negative Effect on Citycon.
Citycon expects that its property operating expenses will increase in the medium term due to, among other things, increased external advisory expenses and marketing and personnel costs. In addition as

<<<

 Citycon's existing properties age, the cost of repairs is expected to increase accordingly, and in accordance with its
8

strategy, Citycon may make significant investments in (re)developing its ageing properties. Such costs could be significantly

<<<

 higher than Citycon expects, and the rent charged to tenants may not cover Citycon's costs, which could result in Citycon making a loss on the property.
In recent years, the construction industry has seen a positive economic cycle in Citycon

<<<

's business areas, which has caused the costs of construction and construction materials to increase. Increases in construction costs could prevent Citycon from implementing all of its planned development projects or cause the profitability

<<<

 of development projects already underway to be lower than projected.
If Citycon does not maintain its ageing properties sufficiently, this may result in decrease in the value of the properties, repair and renovation measures causing significant

<<<

 costs as well as reduction in the demand for retail premises, which could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Any significant increase in the property operating expenses and

<<<

 in construction costs could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon has commissioned the construction of some of the properties it owns. As the owner and developer of the

<<<

 properties, Citycon is liable for possible faults found in the properties as well as other direct or indirect damage pertaining to the properties. Citycon's liability for defects and/or damages may materialise, for example, as compensation

<<<

 to tenants in Citycon's properties for damage caused due to defects in the leased property or compensation to other users of Citycon's properties for damage caused due to faults in the property. Potential faults related to construction and

<<<

 consequent liabilities may jeopardise the profitability of Citycon's business and lower the fair value of investment properties owned by Citycon, which may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial

<<<

 condition.
The Ability to Identify Potentially Profitable Acquisition Targets and Successfully Execute Acquisitions Is a Requirement to Meet Citycon's Growth Targets.
Citycon's strategy is, in addition to (re)development projects, to grow through

<<<

 selective acquisitions of new shopping centres. Citycon has implemented specific processes for its acquisitions and it aims to carefully investigate and analyse potential targets and related liabilities prior to completing an acquisition. The

<<<

 acquisition of additional properties is often preceded by a bidding procedure involving multiple bidders and subject to the successful completion of negotiations. There can be no guarantees that Citycon will find new targets that will fit its

<<<

 strategy at acceptable commercial terms, or that it will successfully manage to complete the bidding or negotiation processes. The inability to find new targets, to identify all potential risks and liabilities relating to such targets, to make

<<<

 correct valuations of such targets or to complete acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The Ability to Integrate Acquired Targets Successfully Is a Requirement

<<<

 to Meet Citycon's Targets for Growth in Profitability.
Citycon's business has grown in recent years, mostly through acquisitions of new shopping centres and completion of (re)development projects. This growth has required and is further expected

<<<

 to require significant management and personnel resources as well as financial resources. Successful integration of acquired properties into Citycon's existing business is essential for Citycon's ability to grow profitably. Should Citycon be

<<<

 unable to successfully integrate targets acquired in the future, this may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition. For further information on the risks relating to the integration

<<<

 of Sektor, please see section "--Risks Relating to the Acquisition and Sektor's Business--The Integration of Sektor's Business into Citycon's Business Might Not Be Successful as Planned".
The Guarantor's Ability to Meet Its Obligations Depends

<<<

 Primarily upon Receipt of Sufficient Funds from Other Members of the Group.
The Guarantor's ability to meet its obligations depends primarily upon receipt of sufficient funds from other members of the Group. The Guarantor is dependent upon

<<<

 payments, including by way of loans, from other members of the Group to generate the funds necessary to pay principal and interest on its borrowings. The Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may from time to time be subject to restrictions on their

<<<

 ability to make such
9

payments to the Guarantor as a result of regulatory, fiscal, and other restrictions. There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on the Guarantor's ability to service its

<<<

 borrowings or meet any other costs it may incur, including in respect of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Guarantor will receive sufficient funds from other members of the Group to meet its financial obligations.
Joint Ventures

<<<

 May Introduce Additional Risks to Citycon.
Citycon may execute real estate acquisitions together with other real estate investors or dispose a part of its properties to third parties. For instance, in January 2013, Citycon acquired Kista Galleria

<<<

, a prime shopping centre in Stockholm in partnership with CPPIB, an investment management organisation investing the funds of the Canada Pension Plan. Citycon and CPPIB each own 50 per cent. of the shopping centre. Further, the Iso Omena (in

<<<

 Espoo) and Mölndal Galleria (in Gothenburg) (re)-developments are carried out in a joint venture with NCC and the (re)-development of IsoKristiina in Lappeenranta with Ilmarinen.
These kinds of joint ventures bring along new risks. Citycon

<<<

's ability to withdraw funds (including dividends) from and to exercise management control over the joint ventures may depend on the consent of the joint venture partners. Any disagreements with its partners for example on the views on developing

<<<

 the business or pursuing the joint projects or other typical risks relating to a joint venture structure, such as potential joint and several or secondary liability for transactions and liabilities of the joint venture entity, the difficulty

<<<

 of maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies and the possible termination and/or commencement of a forced buy or sell procedure by the joint venture partner or of the joint venture partner's stake in the joint venture

<<<

 entity, either as a matter of right or by virtue of alleged non-compliance with the applicable joint venture agreement, may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition to

<<<

 this, lenders may become less willing to lend to Citycon if it has a greater proportion of co-owned properties. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon

<<<

 May Not Be Able to Execute Disposals of Real Estate at Acceptable Prices or at All.
In accordance with its strategy, Citycon has in the past sold properties in part or in full and is continuously considering the divestment of properties that

<<<

 are not considered part of its core portfolio. In 2014, Citycon divested 12 non-core properties for a total value of approximately EUR 30 million. In 2015, Citycon has so far divested one non-core property in Oulu, Finland, at a sales price

<<<

 of approximately EUR 13 million and entered into agreements to divest 16 non-core properties in Finland and Sweden that have a total value of 178 million. The value and price of the disposed properties are influenced by several factors, such

<<<

 as general economic conditions, interest rates, inflation expectations, investor yield requirements, and competitive dynamics. It may also be difficult to sell properties that the markets categorise as non-prime properties. There can be no

<<<

 guarantee that Citycon will be able in the future to execute disposals at acceptable prices or at prices that are higher than the fair market valuation of a particular property. Delayed disposal of properties or disposals of the properties

<<<

 at a loss could slow the growth of Citycon and this may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Delays in divestments of real estate property or divestments made at a loss would

<<<

 also affect Citycon's possibilities to refinance certain financing arrangements related to the Acquisition as planned. See "--Risks Relating to the Acquisition and Sektor's Business--Citycon May Not Be Able to Refinance Certain Financing Arrangements

<<<

 Related to the Acquisition as Planned".
There Is No Guarantee That the Company's Lease Agreements Will Be Extended in the Future and it is Possible that New Lease Agreements Materialise on Materially Worse Conditions.
Citycon's lease agreements

<<<

 are divided into two categories: fixed-term lease agreements and lease agreements effective until further notice. Citycon mainly seeks to enter into fixed term leases. Apartments, storage facilities and individual parking spaces form the main

<<<

 exceptions to this. As of 31 December 2014, leases in effect until further notice represented approximately 8 per cent. of Citycon's property portfolio. The share of leases in effect until further notice has fallen due to the divestment of

<<<

 apartments carried out in Sweden, which mostly had leases in effect until further notice.
Lease agreements effective until further notice introduce a risk that a large number of such agreements may be terminated within a short period of time

<<<

, and this risk potentially increases in an uncertain economic environment. In turn, fixed-term agreements are less flexible, which may in some cases delay necessary
10

development projects in the property during the term of the agreement

<<<

. As at 31 December 2014, 27 per cent. of Citycon's current lease agreements had a first possible maturity date within the next 12 months and the remaining length of Citycon's fixed-term lease agreements averaged 3.2 years as of 30 June 201

<<<

5.
The vast majority of Sektor's lease agreements are fixed-term contracts with the minimum rent adjusted annually based on changes in the CPI plus a turnover component based on the tenant's sales turnover. Sektor also has contracts in which

<<<

 the rent is based solely on the tenant's turnover and the tenant usually has the option to extend for an additional defined period at market terms. As a rule, all leases on new retail premises are signed for a fixed period. More than 90 per

<<<

 cent. of Sektor's contract portfolio (owned, leased and managed) was fixed term contracts as of 31 December 2014. As at 31 December 2014, 14.9 per cent. of Sektor's lease agreements had a first possible maturity date within the next 12 months

<<<

 and the average remaining length of Sektor's lease agreements was 3.5 years. Sektor generally aims to renew these lease agreements with the existing tenants.
Citycon generally aims to renew these lease agreements with the existing tenants.

<<<

 There are, however, no guarantees that Citycon will be successful in extending the lease agreements at current or with increased rent levels. Accordingly, Citycon cannot guarantee that the like-for-like net rental income (NRI) growth achieved

<<<

 during the last years can be maintained. The concurrent termination of a large number of lease agreements and the inability of Citycon to renew these agreements on improved or similar terms could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's

<<<

 business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon Has Exposures to Its Largest Tenants.
Citycon's largest tenants include international and local grocery, fashion and specialty chains, as well as restaurants, tenants from the

<<<

 banking and financing sectors, and municipal and government tenants. As at 31 December 2014 (excluding Sektor), approximately 30.3 per cent. of Citycon's rental income was generated through lease agreements entered into with its five largest

<<<

 tenants, i.e. Kesko, S-Group, ICA Gruppen, Stockmann and H&M. The largest individual tenant is the Kesko Group with its different business units and group companies; which together accounted for approximately 15.4 per cent. of Citycon's rental

<<<

 income on 31 December 2014, whereas the four other aforementioned tenants accounted altogether for 15 per cent. of Citycon's rental income. The most important segment of the Kesko Group is grocery retail trade, which accounted for approximately

<<<

 49 per cent. of its turnover in 2014.6
Sektor's largest tenants also include grocery, fashion and specialty chains, as well as restaurants, tenants from the banking and financing sectors, and municipal and government tenants. As of 30 June

<<<

 2015, approximately 23 per cent. of Sektor's rental income was generated through lease agreements entered into with the five largest tenants, i.e. Varner Gruppen (fashion), NorgesGruppen (groceries), Gresvig (sports apparel), Clas Ohlson (home

<<<

 products) and H&M (fashion). The largest individual tenant as at 30 June 2015 was Varner Gruppen and its group companies. The tenants belonging to the Varner Gruppen group of companies accounted for 7.1 per cent. of Sektor's rental income as

<<<

 per 30 June 2015, whereas the four other aforementioned tenants together accounted for 15.9 per cent. Varner Gruppen operates within fashion and comprises chains such as Dressmann, Cubus, Bik Bok, Carlings, Vivikes and Volt to name a few. Varner

<<<

 Gruppen's combined market share in Norway amounted to 19 per cent. in 2014.7 NorgesGruppen operates within groceries, and controls chains such as Kiwi, SPAR, Joker and Meny, among others. The combined market share of NorgesGruppen in Norway

<<<

 in 2014 was 39.9 per cent.8
The potential inability of Citycon to satisfy the needs of its key tenants leading to decreasing demand for retail space from a key tenant could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rates and rental income

<<<

 of Citycon's properties. Changes in the key tenants' business environment and behaviour, or the loss of rental income from one or more key tenants, could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial

<<<

 condition.

Strong Market-Share Concentration of Grocery Retail Trade in Finland and Norway Limits Competition

<<<

 and Rent Levels.
The two largest tenants of Citycon are Kesko and the S-Group, grocery stores are often anchor tenants in the shopping centres owned by Citycon. Particularly in Finland the grocery retail trade is strongly concentrated. The

<<<

 Kesko Group's market share in the entire grocery retail market in Finland was approximately 33 per cent. in 2014 and the combined market share of Kesko and the S Group was approximately 79 per cent. in 2014.9
Two of Sektor's five largest tenants

<<<

, Varner Gruppen and H&M, operate within the fashion sector. These two tenants combined had a market share of approximately 32 per cent. in Norway in 2014.10 Furthermore, NorgesGruppen had a market share of 39.9 per cent. within the grocery

<<<

 sector in Norway in 2014. 11 NorgesGruppen is considered to hold a dominant share of the Norwegian grocery market.
Both Citycon and Sektor operate in concentrated markets, thereby leading to a situation where Citycon might not always be able

<<<

 to receive satisfactory rent levels from its retail premises. Competition that limits or reduces rental rates and subsequently reduces rent potential from grocery stores could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results

<<<

 of operations, and financial condition.
The Expansion of Citycon's Business into New Geographical Areas May Introduce Additional Risks.
Citycon has expanded its business to Sweden, Estonia, and Denmark by acquiring shopping centres and other

<<<

 retail premises, and has recently entered the Norwegian market through the acquisition of Sektor. In the future, Citycon may further expand its operations into other new markets in accordance with its strategy, in particular Latvia, or by re

<<<

-entering Lithuania. Operations outside of Finland involve potential risks, such as different business cultures, changes in legislation, administrative difficulties, labour issues, and unfavourable tax implications. The real estate markets in

<<<

 the Baltic countries are less developed and, in addition, the economic and political situation is less stable than in the Nordic countries. Any of the above risks may, if they materialise, have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business

<<<

, results of operations, and financial condition. Please see also "--Risks Relating to the Acquisition and Sektor's Business--Entry into a New Market Area May Involve Regulatory and Compliance Risks".
Citycon May Fail to Acquire Required Services

<<<

 or to Transfer the Related Service Cost Increases to Tenants.
Citycon utilises external service providers in its operations in connection with maintaining and constructing Citycon's properties as well as in connection with the planning of development

<<<

 projects. Such external service providers may expose Citycon to various risks, including but not limited to failure to perform their contractual obligations, cost deviations in relation to the external services or liability for their actions

<<<

 or property users for the actions of property users. Citycon's main external operational service providers are delivering services in the fields of cleaning, technical maintenance, utilities and security.
The availability, terms and conditions

<<<

, price, and quality of these external services, as well as the possibility of transferring any increases in the costs of these services to the tenants, are material to Citycon's business. The failure to procure services or to transfer the increase

<<<

 in their costs to tenants may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon Is Dependent Upon Professional Management and Key Personnel.
The success of Citycon materially depends

<<<

 on the professional skills of Citycon's management and personnel, as well as on the ability of Citycon to retain its current management and to recruit new skilled personnel, when needed. Citycon believes that its materialised and expected growth

<<<

 will impose further expectations on its management and other employees. There can be no guarantees that Citycon will be able to recruit enough new personnel or to retain its current management and key personnel in the future. The loss of key

personnel may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon's Insurance Coverage May Prove to Be Inadequate.
Citycon has obtained insurance coverage for its properties and

<<<

 buildings, which it believes to be in line with standard industry practices. This insurance covers liabilities based on possible water damages, fire damages and damages caused by, for example, acts of vandalism or terrorism. In addition, liability

<<<

 insurance aimed to cover damages caused to third parties is also included in Citycon's insurance coverage. Further, Citycon has valid business interruption insurance. Insurance coverage is subject to limits and limitations and some risks may

<<<

 not be covered by insurance. Even if the insurance would be adequate to cover Citycon's direct losses, Citycon could be adversely affected by loss of earnings caused by or relating to damage to its properties. The occurrence of any of the above

<<<

 harmful effects or insufficient insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The Company Is Exposed to Environmental Liabilities.
As owner and holder (as tenant

<<<

) of real property, Citycon could be held liable for possible environmental damage caused by operations carried out in such property if such operations have not been carried out in accordance with applicable regulations. Although Citycon believes

<<<

 that its properties are generally not used for operations that could be particularly harmful to the environment, it cannot be ruled out that they could be held liable for environmental damage incurred on an owned or held property. Although

<<<

 Citycon believes that it has not caused any environmental harm in connection with its management of the properties, it cannot be ruled out that Citycon could be held liable for damages if it causes or has caused environmental harm in connection

<<<

 with management of the properties. Such environmental liability could, if it materialises, have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Any Damage to Citycon's Reputation May Have an

<<<

 Adverse Effect on Citycon's Ability to Attract and Retain Tenants as well as to Retain Key Personnel.
Citycon's ability to attract and retain tenants as well as retain personnel in its employment may suffer if Citycon's reputation is damaged

<<<

. Matters affecting Citycon's reputation may include, among other things, the quality and safety of its business premises, compliance with legislation and official regulations, actions by tenants, and actions by individuals at Citycon's premises

<<<

. Any damage to Citycon's reputation may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon Is Subject to Regulatory and Legal Risks Relating to Securities Issues.
An issuance of shares

<<<

 or other securities by Citycon in or into certain jurisdictions may be subject to specific registration, admission or qualification requirements or other restrictions imposed by local law or regulatory authorities, or be prohibited altogether

<<<

. Citycon uses its best efforts to comply with such restrictions, but it cannot be excluded that due to ambiguities related to the application of and practice related to such restrictions, or due to any other reason, Citycon may become subject

<<<

 to regulatory or legal proceedings potentially resulting in fines or penalties or liability for damages. Citycon has a large number of foreign investors and may also in the future market its securities to foreign investors, which may also increase

<<<

 the risk of potential claims by investors based on any securities laws or regulations applicable to such investors. Even if any such allegations or claims against Citycon were without merit, such claims or regulatory and legal proceedings might

<<<

 nevertheless cause Citycon significant reputational harm and expose Citycon to significant legal costs.
Credit Losses May Increase as a Result of the Tenants' Financial Difficulties.
As a consequence of the weaker economic environment, incidences

<<<

 of tenants experiencing financial difficulties during the terms of their lease have increased in recent years. To mitigate risk, the majority of Citycon's lease agreements include rental guarantees. Credit losses have remained stable in recent

<<<

 years, amounting to EUR 1.2 million at the end of 2014 (the amount of credit losses was EUR 0.9 million in 2013, EUR 1.2 million in 2012 and EUR 0.8 million in 2011). However, Citycon's credit losses may increase in the future. Any significant

<<<

 credit losses could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition. The corresponding number on Sektor's behalf with regard to credit losses has been NOK 7.5 million
13

in 2014 and NOK

<<<

 4.3 million in 2013. According to Sektor's internal routines, credit losses are booked when the claim has been outstanding for in excess of 60 days.
Citycon's Actual Performance May Differ Materially from the Long-Term Financial Targets and

<<<

 Prospects Included in this Prospectus.
Citycon's long-term financial targets and prospects included in the section "Citycon's Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" constitute forward-looking information that is subject to considerable

<<<

 uncertainty. The long-term financial targets and prospects are based upon a number of assumptions relating to, among others, the development of Citycon's industry, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Citycon's actual business

<<<

, results of operations, and financial condition, and the development of the industry and the macroeconomic environment in which Citycon operates, may differ materially from, and be more negative than, those assumed by Citycon when preparing

<<<

 the long-term financial targets and prospects included in this Prospectus. As a result, Citycon's ability to reach these long-term financial targets and prospects is subject to uncertainties and contingencies, some of which are beyond Citycon

<<<

's control, and no assurance can be given that Citycon will be able to reach these targets and prospects or that Citycon's financial condition or results of operations will not be materially different from the long-term financial targets and

<<<

 prospects that Citycon has set for itself and included in this Prospectus.
Financing Risks Relating to Citycon's Business
The Interests of Our Significant Shareholders May Be Inconsistent with the Interests of Noteholders.
There are, as of

<<<

 the date of this Prospectus, certain shareholders who hold, directly and indirectly, a significant position in Citycon's share capital. The interests of Citycon's significant shareholders could conflict with the interests of Noteholders. On

<<<

 31 July 2015, Citycon's largest shareholder, Gazit-Globe Ltd., held 42.8 per cent. of all the shares and votes in Citycon. Gazit-Globe Ltd.'s shareholding enables it to prevent resolutions requiring a majority of at least two-thirds of the

<<<

 votes cast and shares represented at a General Meeting of Shareholders. Such resolutions include a resolution to amend Citycon's Articles of Association, resolutions to issue shares in deviation from the pre-emptive subscription right of shareholders

<<<

 and resolutions regarding a potential merger, demerger or liquidation of Citycon.
CPP Investment Board Europe S.à r.l (CPPIBE) is Citycon's second largest shareholder holding approximately 15 per cent. of all the shares and votes in Citycon

<<<

 on 31 July 2015. CPPIBE and Gazit-Globe Ltd. have on 12 May 2014 entered into an agreement documenting the parties' objectives in certain governance matters relating to Citycon (the Governance Agreement).
The Governance Agreement includes,

<<<

 among other things, an undertaking by each of CPPIBE and Gazit-Globe Ltd. to support a certain number of nominees proposed by the other party to the Board of Directors of Citycon, taking into account the independence requirements imposed under

<<<

 the Finnish Corporate Governance Code (the Corporate Governance Code). For further information on the composition of Citycon's Board of Directors, please see section "Directors, Corporate Governance and Management of the Guarantor". Significant

<<<

 shareholders interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and may affect potential actions or transactions that might benefit the Noteholders.
Gazit-Globe Ltd.'s Ownership May Exceed 50 per cent. Triggering Change of Control

<<<

 Clauses and an Obligation to Make a Mandatory Public Offer.
Should the ownership of Gazit-Globe Ltd. exceed 50 per cent. of the votes carried by Citycon's shares, this would trigger an obligation for Gazit-Globe Ltd. to make a mandatory public

<<<

 tender offer for the remaining shares and securities entitling their holder to shares in Citycon under the Finnish Securities Market Act unless the FSA grants an exemption from such obligation. Further, the ownership of Gazit-Globe Ltd. exceeding

<<<

 50­ 55 per cent. of the votes carried by Citycon's shares would constitute a change of control in Citycon as defined in certain of Citycon's debt financing agreements and bond terms. Such a change of control would impose an obligation for Citycon

<<<

 either to repay the loans and bond holdings in question prematurely or negotiate with creditors in question about extension and terms of the financing, which Citycon may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
14

The

<<<

 Governance Agreement Entered into Between Gazit-Globe Ltd. and CPPIBE May Trigger an Obligation to Make a Mandatory Public Offer.
According to information received from Gazit-Globe Ltd. and CPPIBE by Citycon, the purpose of the Governance Agreement

<<<

 is to agree on a framework for certain governance mechanisms and processes that CPPIBE and Gazit-Globe Ltd. deem would contribute to the effective governance of Citycon in the interest of all of its shareholders. The Governance Agreement regulates

<<<

, among other things, the appointment of members to the Board of Directors of Citycon and CPPIBE's tag-along right in the event of transfer of shares in Citycon by Gazit-Globe Ltd.
According to information received by Citycon, Gazit-Globe Ltd

<<<

. and CPPIBE have received statements from the FSA to the effect that the Governance Agreement does not, as such, constitute acting in concert as defined under the Finnish Securities Market Act, and thus does not trigger an obligation for the

<<<

 parties to make a mandatory public tender offer for the shares in Citycon. The FSA notes in its statements that this position should be reassessed should the parties strive to materially reduce the number of the members of the Board of Directors

<<<

 of Citycon from the current ten (10) members. According to information received by Citycon, as a result of the FSA's above-mentioned statement, the Governance Agreement includes an undertaking by Gazit-Globe Ltd. and CPPIBE to the effect that

<<<

 they will refrain from any actions to materially reduce the number of the members of the Board of Directors from the current number.
However, should there be a material change in the circumstances affecting the grounds of the FSA's statement

<<<

 referred to above, the Governance Agreement entered into between Gazit-Globe Ltd. and CPPIBE could be deemed to constitute acting in concert as defined under the Finnish Securities Market Act and, consequently, could trigger an obligation for

<<<

 Gazit-Globe Ltd. and CPPIBE to make a mandatory public tender offer for the remaining shares and securities entitling their holder to shares in Citycon.
Citycon May Not Be Able to Secure Financing on Satisfactory Terms or at All in the Future

<<<

.
Citycon operates in a sector that requires high levels of investment for growth. Citycon has in recent years carried out different equity and debt financing arrangements, including directed share issues (2007, 2010, 2011 and 2014), rights

<<<

 issues (2007, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015), bond issues (2009, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015) as well as several credit facility arrangements (2007­2015). Citycon has refinanced most of its debt in the last two years, and has no major long-term debt

<<<

 maturing until in 2017. On 30 June 2015, Citycon's unused credit limits and cash balance amounted to EUR 343.6 million.
Citycon has commitments to lenders to the effect that it undertakes to maintain its adjusted equity ratio at above 32.5

<<<

 per cent., and its interest coverage ratio at a minimum of 1.8. Citycon's adjusted equity ratio was 52.0 per cent. and the interest coverage ratio was 4.0 on 30 June 2015. Further, under the terms of the bonds issued in 2013 and 2014, Citycon

<<<

 has committed to maintaining its solvency ratio at or below 0.65 and its secured solvency ratio at or below 0.25. Citycon's solvency ratio was 0.38 and its secured solvency ratio was 0.00 on 30 June 2015. These covenants are calculated bi-annually

<<<

 according to the debt agreement. Citycon expects to have ample headroom under these financial covenants immediately following the completion of the Acquisition. In addition, the secured bank financing of Sektor will have to be refinanced by

<<<

 April 2016. See "--Risks Relating to the Acquisition and Sektor's Business--Citycon May Not Be Able to Refinance Certain Financing Arrangements Related to the Acquisition as Planned".
Furthermore, the macroeconomic condition of the euro area

<<<

 as a whole might also have a significant effect on Citycon's ability to obtain financing. Deterioration in the economy of the euro area could result in a reduction in the capital that lenders are willing to deploy within the euro area, which

<<<

 may result in increased financing costs or the lack of available financing on economically viable terms.
Citycon's growth strategy, refinancing of maturing debt and upcoming new investments create a need for new funding. If Citycon is unable

<<<

 to obtain financing on commercially favorable terms, or if delays are incurred in obtaining such financing, this could impair Citycon's ability to make investments, or force Citycon to divest assets, which, in turn, could have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on the execution of Citycon's strategy and Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
15

Increases in Interest Rates and Credit Margins Increase Citycon's Financing Costs.
Changes in interest rates have a significant

<<<

 effect on the real estate business. Market interest rates fell sharply due to the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008 and have stayed at very low levels in historical terms since then. Interest rates are naturally expected to increase over

<<<

 time.
Fluctuations in interest rates affect Citycon's floating-rate loan interest expenses, which increase as market interest rates increase. Citycon carefully monitors the development of interest rates and actively hedges its position against

<<<

 changes in interest rates. According to Citycon's financing policy, its interest rate position must be hedged at a minimum level of 70 per cent. and at a maximum level of 90 per cent. Citycon mainly uses fixed-rate debt and interest rate swaps

<<<

 to manage its interest rate risks. Citycon's debt portfolio's hedging ratio was 81.5 per cent. on 30 June 2015. However, there can be no assurance that Citycon's hedging activities will be effective.
A substantial increase in interest rates

<<<

 may also affect private consumption or the ability of tenants to pay rents or may lead to increased vacancy rates of Citycon's business premises.
Credit margins charged by Citycon's lenders increased clearly in 2008­2012 due to the financial

<<<

 crisis. During 2013 and 2014, the margins have decreased, but are still at a somewhat higher level than prior to the financial crisis. Tightening regulation of the banking sector (the Basel III) may contribute to higher costs of financing for

<<<

 banks, which may again result in an increase in the price of Citycon's new debt financing and Citycon's average interest rate level.
A material increase in interest rates or increased credit margins could, especially in the long term, have

<<<

 a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Credit Ratings May Not Reflect All Risks.
Moody's and S&P have assigned credit ratings to Citycon. Following the Acquisition, both rating agencies

<<<

 have confirmed the current ratings (BBB by S&P and Baa2 by Moody's) with stable outlook.
These ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks relating to Citycon's business. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or

<<<

 hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. Should Citycon's credit rating be downgraded, this could increase the financial costs of Citycon in the longer term and, therefore, have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon's Financing Agreements Involve Counterparty Risk.
International financial institutions are counterparties to Citycon's long-term bank loans, derivative contracts

<<<

 and insurance contracts. It cannot be excluded that Citycon's financing or insurance counterparties will experience financial difficulties or bankruptcy in the future. Should one or more of the financial institutions that are Citycon's counterparties

<<<

 experience financial difficulties or bankruptcy, this could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Citycon Is Exposed to Fluctuations in Exchange Rates.
Citycon is exposed to foreign

<<<

 currency risks due to its operations outside of the euro area, mainly from the Swedish krona and Norwegian krona.
According to Citycon's policy all currency net positions with an effect on the profit and loss statement is managed and hedged

<<<

 with currency derivatives.
In order to prepare its financial statements, Citycon must convert the values of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in Swedish krona into euro at exchange rates applicable in the relevant time

<<<

 period. Accordingly, significant movements in currency rates between the euro and the Swedish krona may have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations and financial condition.
16

In Sweden, most of Citycon's sales

<<<

 and expenses are denominated in Swedish krona. To minimise any negative impact caused by exchange rate volatility, Citycon seeks to finance its Swedish business in Swedish krona so that changes in operating profit due to currency fluctuations

<<<

 are partly offset by changes in financial expenses.

Following the acquisition of Sektor, Citycon is exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations of the Norwegian krone, the same way as to the Swedish krona risk. Accordingly, significant movements

<<<

 in currency rates between the euro and the Norwegian krone may thereby have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.

In Denmark, the Danish krone has been closely pegged to the euro from

<<<

 the start and it does not, therefore, expose Citycon to major exchange rate risks. If the situation were to change and the Danish krone were devaluated as against the euro it could have a material adverse effect on Citycon's business, results

<<<

 of operations, and financial condition.

Factors which are Material for the Purposes of Assessing the Market Risks Associated with the Notes

The Notes May Not Be a Suitable Investment for All Investors.
Each potential investor in the Notes

<<<

 must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

(i)

have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and

<<<



risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this

Prospectus or any applicable supplement;

(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of

<<<

 its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;

(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the

<<<

 Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency;

(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant financial markets

<<<

; and

(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

The Notes Are

<<<

 Subject to Optional Redemption by the Issuer.
The Notes contain an optional redemption feature, which is likely to limit their market value. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally

<<<

 will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.

The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the

<<<

 Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower

<<<

 rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.

Risks Related to the Notes Generally Set out below is a brief description of certain risks relating to the Notes generally:


<<<


Modification, Waivers and Substitution.

The conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders

<<<

 including

17

Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
The conditions of the Notes also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of Noteholders

<<<

, agree to (i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of Notes, the Trust Deed or the Agency Agreement or (ii) determine without the consent of the Noteholders that any

<<<

 Event of Default or potential Event of Default shall not be treated as such or (iii) the substitution of another company being the Guarantor or another Subsidiary of the Guarantor as principal debtor under any Notes in place of the Issuer,

<<<

 in the circumstances described in Conditions 15 and 14.
Change of Law.
The conditions of the Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of this Prospectus. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision

<<<

 or change to English law or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus and any such change could materially adversely impact the value of any Notes affected by it.
Denominations Involve Integral Multiples: Definitive Notes.
The

<<<

 Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum of 100,000 plus integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof up to and including 199,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples of 100,000. In

<<<

 such a case a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds principal amount which is less than 100,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the remainder of such holding without first purchasing

<<<

 a principal amount of Notes at or in excess of 100,000 such that its holding amounts to 100,000 or a higher integral multiple of 1,000. Further, a Noteholder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds a principal amount which is less than

<<<

 100,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a definitive Note in respect of such holding (should definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Notes such that

<<<

 its holding amounts to 100,000.
If definitive Notes are issued, holders should be aware that definitive Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of 100,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.
Risks related to the

<<<

 Market Generally
Set out below is a brief description of the principal market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk:
An Active Trading Market for the Notes May Not Develop.
The Notes may have

<<<

 no established trading market when issued and the Issuer cannot assure investors that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or be maintained. In addition, there may be a limited number of buyers when an investor decides to sell

<<<

 the Notes, which can affect the price an investor receives for such Notes or the ability to sell such Notes at all. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable

<<<

 to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. A lack of liquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.
Exchange Rate Risks and Exchange Controls.
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on

<<<

 the Notes in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the Investor's Currency) other than euro. These include the risk

<<<

 that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the euro or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange

<<<

 controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to euro would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes

<<<

 and (3) the Investor's Currency equivalent market value of the Notes.
18

Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result

<<<

, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal. Interest Rate Risks Investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of them

<<<

. Credit Ratings May Not Reflect All Risks. Moody's and S&P are expected to assign credit ratings to the Notes. These ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above

<<<

, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. In general, European regulated investors are

<<<

 restricted under the CRA Regulation from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established in the EU and registered under the CRA Regulation (and such registration has not been

<<<

 withdrawn or suspended), subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending. Such general restriction will also apply in the case of credit ratings issued by non EU credit rating

<<<

 agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EU registered credit rating agency or the relevant non EU rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the

<<<

 case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended). The list of registered and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive

<<<

 evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the updated ESMA list. Certain information

<<<

 with respect to the credit rating agencies and ratings is set out on the cover of this Prospectus. Legal Investment Considerations May Restrict Certain Investments. The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment

<<<

 laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (1) the Notes are legal investments for it, (2) the Notes can be used as

<<<

 collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment

<<<

 of the Notes under any applicable risk based capital or similar rules.
19

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements included in this Prospectus may constitute "forward-looking statements". Forward- looking statements are all statements

<<<

 in this Prospectus that do not relate to historical facts and events, and include statements concerning the Company's plans, objectives, goals, strategies and future operations and performance and the assumptions underlying these forward-looking

<<<

 statements. The Company uses the words "will", "believes", "assumes", "intends", "estimates", "expects", "may", "will", "plans", "seeks", "approximately", "aims", "projects", "anticipates" or similar expressions to generally identify forward

<<<

- looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are set forth in a number of places in this Prospectus, including (without limitation) in the sections "Risk Factors", "Description of the Guarantor", "Operating and Financial Review" and "Citycon

<<<

's Property Portfolio in Brief and Investments, Divestments and Development Projects". The Company has based these forward-looking statements on the current view of its management with respect to future events and financial performance. These

<<<

 views reflect the best judgment of the Company's management but involve uncertainties and are subject to certain risks, the occurrence of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements

<<<

 contained in this Prospectus and from past results, performance or achievements. Examples of these risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled "Risk Factors" in this Prospectus

<<<

 including the following: the economic fluctuations and economic development; the imbalance of the euro area; the fair value of Citycon's investment properties and the objectivity of property valuation statements; the decreasing private consumption

<<<

 and decreasing demand for retail premises; property portfolio concentration and dependency upon retail sales; negative impact of the increasing internet commerce; the increased competition in the real estate market and the impact of competition

<<<

 regulations; changes in tax laws and international financial reporting standards; Citycon's ability to refinance certain financing arrangements; the successful integration of Sektor's business; possible known or unknown deficiencies and liabilities

<<<

 of Sektor; entry into new market areas; failure by Sektor to prematurely redeem all of its outstanding bonds; drag-along rights; title to property being separated from beneficial ownership of property; operational activities costs; exposure

<<<

 to the largest tenants; expansion of Citycon's business into new geographical areas; insurance coverage; reputational damage; credit losses; the ability to secure financing; counterparty risk; the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates

<<<

 and exchange rates; and modifications, waivers and substitution of the Notes. Although the Company believes that the estimates and the projections reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable, if one or more of the risks or uncertainties

<<<

 materialise or occur, including those which the Company has identified in this Prospectus, or if any of the Company's underlying assumptions prove to be incomplete or incorrect, the Company's actual results of operations may vary from those

<<<

 expected, estimated or projected.
These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Prospectus. Except to the extent required by law, the Company is not obliged to, and does not intend to, update or revise any forward-looking

<<<

 statements made in this Prospectus whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company, or persons acting on the Company's behalf, are expressly

<<<

 qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained throughout this Prospectus. As a result of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, a prospective purchaser of the Notes should not place undue reliance on these forward

<<<

-looking statements.

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS

<<<

 RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE REPRESENTED BY THE GLOBAL NOTES
The following is a summary of the provisions to be contained in the Trust Deed to constitute the Notes and in the Global Notes which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Conditions

<<<

 of the Notes while the Notes are represented by the Global Notes.

1.

Exchange

The Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive Notes only:

(a)

upon the happening of any

<<<

 of the events defined in the Trust Deed as "Events of Default";

(b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces

<<<

 an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or

(c)

if the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be


<<<


suffered were the Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two

Directors of the Issuer is given to the Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of (a) and (b) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting on the

<<<

 instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Issuer and (in the case of (c) above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the Noteholders, of its intention to exchange the

<<<

 Permanent Global Note for definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below).

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the Permanent Global Note may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender the Permanent Global Note

<<<

 to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent. In exchange for the Permanent Global Note the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (having attached to them all Coupons in

<<<

 respect of interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note), security printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the form set out in the Trust Deed. On exchange

<<<

 of the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer will procure that it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant definitive Notes.

For these purposes, Exchange Date means a day specified in the notice

<<<

 requiring exchange falling not less than 60 days after that on which such notice is given and being a day on which banks are open for general business in the place in which the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent is located and,

<<<

 except in the case of exchange pursuant to (b) above, in the place in which the relevant clearing system is located.

2.

Payments

On and after 26 October 2015, no payment will be made on the Temporary Global Note unless exchange for an interest

<<<

 in the Permanent Global Note is improperly withheld or refused. Payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Note will, subject as set out below, be made to the bearer of such Global Note and, if no further

<<<

 payment falls to be made in respect of the Notes, against surrender of such Global Note to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the Noteholders for such purposes. The Issuer shall

<<<

 procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and the nominal amount of the Notes recorded in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and represented by such Global

<<<

 Note will be reduced accordingly. Each payment so made will discharge the Issuer's obligations in respect thereof. Any failure to make the entries in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg shall not affect such discharge.

41

<<<



Payments of interest on the Temporary Global Note (if permitted by the first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership unless such certification has already been made.

DESCRIPTION

<<<

 OF THE GUARANTOR Overview Citycon is a leading owner, manager and developer of urban grocery-anchored shopping centres in the Nordic and Baltic regions, with assets under management totalling approximately EUR 3.4 billion at 30 June 2015 (EUR

<<<

 4.9 billion following the Acquisition) (including the fair value of investment properties and joint ventures) and a market cap of approximately EUR 2.0 billion at 30 June 2015. Headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, Citycon is the number one shopping

<<<

 centre owner in Finland in its industry and among the market leaders in Estonia, Sweden and Norway.12 Citycon also has a foothold in Denmark. On 30 June 2015, Citycon owned 3513 shopping centres and 25 other retail properties. Citycon focuses

<<<

 on leading shopping centres in the Nordics and Baltics. Citycon's properties are urban and typically grocery-anchored. The shopping centres are located close to residential areas and office locations and, therefore, are easily accessible. Citycon

<<<

 actively (re)develops its properties to improve their vitality and competitiveness. Large, well-established shopping centres represent the core of the property portfolio. In addition to wholly-owned properties, Citycon may be a co-owner of

<<<

 properties with joint venture partners. This ownership structure is selected from time to time for the largest investments to free up capital for, among other things, the (re)development of other properties in Citycon's portfolio. Citycon's

<<<

 major tenants include specialty and grocery chains as well as cafés and restaurants, banks and financial institutions, and municipal and other public administration. Citycon's five largest tenants (by rental income) and shopping centre rental

<<<

 income by branches as at 31 December 2014 are illustrated in the below figures:

Shopping centre rental income by branches, 31 December 2014
Citycon's business operations are divided into three business units: Finland, Sweden, and Baltic Countries

<<<

 and New Business (and following the integration of Sektor, Citycon will have a fourth business unit in Norway). Each business unit is further divided into clusters. In the cluster organisational model, shopping centres are combined to form

<<<

 entities that are led by commercial directors. As of 30 June 2015, the Finnish unit was composed of three clusters, the Swedish unit of two clusters, and the Baltic Countries and New Business Unit of one cluster. The clusters are supported

<<<

 by centralised leasing, development, marketing and finance teams. For the financial year ended 31 December 2014, Citycon's turnover was EUR 245.3 million and operating profit EUR 165.0 million, which corresponded to 67.3 per cent. of turnover

<<<

. As of 30 June 2015, Citycon had 151 employees of whom 87 worked in Finland, 50 in Sweden, ten in Estonia, one in Denmark and three in the Netherlands. Citycon has investment-grade credit ratings from S&P (BBB, outlook stable) and Moody's 

<<<

(Baa2, outlook stable). Citycon is a public limited company incorporated on 13 April 1988 under the laws of Finland with registration number 0699505-3, and Citycon's shares have been listed on the Helsinki stock exchange (now NASDAQ OMX Helsinki

<<<

 Ltd., the Helsinki Stock Exchange) since November 1988. Citycon's registered office is located at Korkeavuorenkatu 35, 00130 Helsinki, Finland and its telephone number is +358 20 766 4400. Operational History Citycon was established in 198

<<<

8 by the Insurance Company Sampo Pension Ltd, Imatran Voima Oy, Rakennustoimisto A. Puolimatka Oy and Postipankki. During the same year, Citycon was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Initially, Citycon's business focused on office premises

<<<

. In 1998, Citycon's business concept was modified and the focus was shifted to Finnish retail properties. Citycon acquired retail properties throughout Finland from Kesko Corporation, Merita Real Estate Ltd and Nova Life Insurance Company Ltd

<<<

. Citycon almost doubled its property portfolio in 1999 through acquisitions, including acquiring majority stakes in 11 shopping centres in Finland and minority stakes in Koskikeskus, Tampere and Jyväskeskus, Jyväskeslä. As a result of the acquisitions

<<<

, the sellers, including Nordea, Kesko and Sampo with their group companies, became significant shareholders of Citycon. In 2003, Citycon refined its business strategy to include development of properties in addition to owning, leasing and managing

<<<

 retail premises. The ownership base of Citycon changed significantly as the former major owners Kesko, Nordea and Sampo sold their shareholdings and international investors became the largest group of owners in Citycon.
46

The expansion outside

<<<

 Finland began in 2005 when Citycon acquired its first properties in Sweden and Estonia. Citycon acquired 75 per cent. of the Åkersberga Centrum shopping centre in Sweden in July 2005, and, Citycon also expanded its operations into Estonia,

<<<

 acquiring Tallinn's Rocca al Mare shopping centre. In 2005, Citycon acquired altogether five shopping centres in Sweden and Estonia.
In 2006, Citycon continued its expansion into new market areas when it purchased the Mandarinas shopping centre

<<<

 in the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius. New properties were also acquired in Finland, Sweden and Estonia during 2007. In September 2007, Citycon completed the acquisition of Iso Omena shopping centre in Espoo.
In 2008, Citycon changed the focus

<<<

 in its growth strategy and started to put more emphasis on the (re)development of existing shopping centres instead of new acquisitions. Of these (re)development projects, the Trio shopping centre in Lahti was opened to the public in its entirety

<<<

 at the end of 2008, and the extension project of the Rocca al Mare shopping centre in Tallinn as well as the new shopping centre Liljeholmstorget Galleria in Stockholm were completed in 2009. The Liljeholmstorget Galleria shopping centre was

<<<

 the largest single development project in Citycon's history at the time.
In 2010, Citycon continued (re)developing its existing shopping centres, the most important projects being Åkersberga Centrum in the Greater Stockholm Area, Espoontori

<<<

 in Espoo and Forum in Jyväskylä. In addition, Citycon began construction in Myllypuro, Helsinki, and Martinlaakso, Vantaa, with the purpose of rebuilding the old-fashioned retail centres into modern shopping centres.
During 2011, Citycon acquired

<<<

 two shopping centres, Högdalen Centrum in Stockholm and Kristiine in Tallinn. Citycon also launched the (re)development of the Koskikeskus shopping centre in Tampere, (re)development and extension project of the Magistral shopping centre in

<<<

 Tallinn and the refurbishment of Åkermyntan Centrum in Stockholm. In July 2011, Citycon introduced its clarified strategy, with a stronger focus on growth in its core business. In addition to the existing operating countries, the other Nordic

<<<

 and Baltic countries, namely Norway, Denmark and Latvia, were also included in the strategy. Supermarket and shop properties were defined as noncore properties with the aim to dispose the asset within the coming years.
During 2012, Citycon

<<<

 acquired the shopping centre Arabia in Helsinki and the shopping centre Albertslund Centrum in the greater Copenhagen area, which was Citycon's first acquisition in Denmark.
In 2013, Citycon and CPPIB jointly acquired the Kista Galleria shopping

<<<

 centre in Stockholm. Citycon also started the extension and (re)development of its largest shopping centre in Finland, Iso Omena in Espoo. Citycon and NCC Property Development Oy invested in the first phase of the extension based on a 50-5

<<<

0 partnership. The estimated cost for the project including partial (re)development of the existing shopping centre amounts to approximately EUR 250 million. The project covers a 35,000 sq.m. extension connected to the future metro station.

<<<


In 2014, Citycon continued updating its property portfolio in line with its strategy. This was demonstrated through the acquisition of GIC's 40 per cent. stake in the Iso Omena shopping centre in Espoo, increasing Citycon's stake in the centre

<<<

 to 100 per cent. Citycon also joined forces with NCC to build Mölndal Galleria shopping centre in Gothenburg and continued its disposal strategy by divesting 12 non-core assets, including the Mandarinas shopping centre in Vilnius.
In 2015,

<<<

 Citycon acquired Sektor in Norway. Through the Acquisition, Citycon gained exposure throughout the entire Nordic region, while increasing its assets under management by nearly 50 per cent., from EUR 3.4 billion to EUR 4.9 billion.

<<<

 million for shopping centres in the Stockholm area and Umeå, EUR 329.6 million for shopping centres in Tallinn and EUR 19.8 million for shopping centres in the Greater Copenhagen area. In Norway, Citycon's properties are located mainly in Oslo

 more than 1,000,000 sq.m. and an estimated gross leasable area of approximately 765,600 sq.m. (excluding parking) as of 31 December 2014.
Sektor focuses on shopping centres with a leading position in their catchment area, and actively develops

<<<

 the properties to promote viability and competitiveness. Sektor's shopping centres are typically located close to where people live and work, and they are easily accessible by public transportation or car.
Sektor generates its rental income

<<<

 through a diversified portfolio of tenants, including grocery, fashion and specialty chains, restaurants and public and health services providers. In 2014, 86.6 per cent. of Sektor's rental income was generated from retail, grocery and restaurant

<<<

 tenants, 6.2 per cent. was from parking and miscellaneous, 5.7 per cent. was from office tenants and public and health services providers and 1.5 per cent. was from leased storages. The retail segment has the following distribution of rental

<<<

 income: fashion/clothes/shoes: 29.4 per cent.; specialty stores: 25.1 per cent.; home apparel: 18.4 per cent.; restaurants: 5.8 per cent. and health and public services: 3.9 per cent. In 2014, the five largest tenants of Sektor were Norgesgruppen

<<<

 (groceries), Varner Gruppen (fashion), Gresvig (sports apparel), Clas Ohlson (home apparel) and H&M (fashion). Altogether, these tenants accounted for 23 per cent. of Sektor's total rental income.
Property management on behalf of other owners

<<<

 is an important part of Sektor's business as it creates economies of scale and the larger volumes enable acquisitions on better terms, administrative savings, synergies such as the ability to offer new chains and concepts through a larger shopping

<<<

 centre portfolio and management fees. Property management on behalf of other owners comprises group/corporate management and real estate management, including operations and leasing of premises. For services related to real estate management

<<<

, Sektor receives 5 per cent. of the ordinary income generated by the underlying property companies owning the shopping centres. Ordinary income is defined as income generated from retail, office and storage premises, parking, commissions, buy

<<<

-outs (for example, penalties for early termination of lease agreements) and reimbursements. In addition, Sektor receives an administration fee of 5 per cent. on common costs and marketing fees paid by the tenants to the operating companies

<<<

. For additional services such as accounting, Sektor charges a fixed per hour fee. In some cases, Sektor is also entitled to bonus payments, for example if the increase in rental income exceeds the increase in the consumer price index. This

<<<

 is agreed upon on a case-bycase basis.
Operational history
Sektor was established in 1997 by five investors with backgrounds from two leading Norwegian shopping centre owners, Steen & Strøm ASA and Olav Thon Gruppen. In October of the same

<<<

 year, the first property was purchased, Storgaten 30­32 in Tønsberg from Storebrand Eiendom. Throughout 1997, several private share placements were made in order for Sektor to have a sufficient amount of equity to grow and participate in larger

<<<

 projects. During this period, one of the previous owners, Anker Holding AS, controlled by Petter Stordalen, invested in Sektor for the first time. The participation of Anker Holding AS represented an important milestone for the development

<<<

 of the Sektor Group in the following years.
In April 1998, an agreement was made with Joh.Johannson (the largest group within groceries in Norway) to purchase 15 retail properties of which four are still owned by Sektor. As part of the transaction

<<<

, Joh.Johannson became the largest shareholder of Sektor with an ownership stake of 34 per cent. The foundation for future growth and development of a significant portfolio of shopping centres as well as active real estate management was established

<<<

.
19 The appraised property value from DTZ presented here includes the value of development projects. Accordingly, this figure differs from the fair market value presented under "Sektor's property portfolio" below, which is also derived from

<<<

 the appraisal report of DTZ, but does not include the value of development projects. In the DTZ report, all properties have been appraised under the assumption of 100 per cent. ownership, i.e. no deductions have been made for properties which

<<<

 are partly owned by Sektor.
54

In 1999, Sektor concluded its first major new build project when Storbyen Senter in Sarpsborg was completed. During 1999, Sektor also purchased Bryn Senter in Oslo and Trekanten Senter in Asker from MøllerGruppen

<<<

. MøllerGruppen became a significant shareholder in Sektor through the transaction with an ownership stake of 24 per cent.
In 2000, the Sektor Group purchased Liertoppen Kjøpesenter in Lier, which is located between Oslo and Drammen and was

<<<

 at the time one of Norway's largest shopping centres. In 2001, Sektor also acquired Herkules in Skien.
MøllerGruppen progressively increased its stake in Sektor and in 2001, it agreed with Anker Holding AS and Joh.Johannson to purchase all

<<<

 of their shares. Following the transaction, Sektor became part of MøllerGruppen. During 2003, Sektor became owned by the Schage family. The strategy of Sektor remained the same, to be a leading owner, operator and developer of retail property

<<<

.
In 2004, Sektor was engaged in a number of larger retail development projects, including Kolbotn Torg outside Oslo and Stortorvet at Kongsberg. The project at Kolbotn Torg was a joint venture between Sektor and PEAB AS with focus on retail

<<<

 and housing development. The development of Stortorvet was a retail project making Stortorvet the largest shopping centre in the Kongsberg district at the time.
In 2006, Sektor established Salto Eiendom AS, a joint venture in cooperation with

<<<

 AVA Invest AS. Salto Eiendom AS' sole focus was to own and operate small and medium sized shopping centres. As part of the establishment, three smaller shopping centres were transferred from Sektor to Salto Eiendom AS.
In 2010, Sektor Group

<<<

 was again subject to reorganisation following the sale of Sektor from the Schage family to Niam IV Holding AS, controlled by the Swedish private equity fund Niam. In connection with the transaction, the shares in the joint venture Salto Eiendom

<<<

 were sold to Schage Eiendom AS. During 2010, Sektor extended its portfolio of managed properties as Storebrand, a leading Norwegian insurance and pension fund, chose Sektor as their asset manager.
In March 2012, Sektor expanded its management

<<<

 of centres owned by other investors as an agreement for management of the four shopping centres held by Niam V Kjøpesenter Holding AS was signed. Included in the portfolio were Strandtorget at Lillehammer, Stadionparken in Stavanger, CC Varehus

<<<

 in Drammen and Torget Vest in Drammen. Later in 2012, further changes in the ownership of Sektor were made as Niam IV Holding AS reduced its ownership. After the partial divestment by Niam, Sektor was controlled by Niam IV Holding AS, Joh Handel

<<<

 Eiendom 1 AS, Varner Invest AS and K&S Holding AS.
In December 2012, Sektor bought 49 per cent. of the shares of Sektor Portefølje I AS, which owns the shopping centres Oasen in Bergen, Storbyen in Sarpsborg and Sjøsiden in Horten. Sektor was

<<<

 managing Storbyen at the time, whereas Sjøsiden and Oasen represented increased volume under management and thus further strengthened the position of Sektor Group within retail property management. The share of ownership in Sektor Portefølje

<<<

 I AS was increased to 60 per cent. in 2013, and to 69.2 per cent. in 2014, which is Sektor's current shareholding in Sektor Portefølje I AS. The three centres were consolidated into Sektor's accounts as of 1 April 2013. Oasen in Bergen was

<<<

 under rehabilitation at the time it was acquired by Sektor. The project included expansion of retail and office space as well as rehabilitation and modernisation of the existing space. The full project was completed in November 2014.
In 20

<<<

13, Sektor acquired another portfolio of shopping centres from Storebrand and Sektor Portefølje Syd AS was established. The portfolio comprised four properties: Buskerud Storsenter and Krokstad Senter in Nedre Eiker, Magasinet in Drammen and

<<<

 Down Town in Porsgrunn.
In late 2013, Sektor further strengthened its position and its management through a joint venture with Partners Group AG, a global investment manager within a wide range of markets. Sektor Portefølje II AS was established

<<<

 and purchased the shopping centres Stovner Senter in Oslo, Torvbyen in Fredrikstad, Markedet in Haugesund and Halden Storsenter in Halden from Steen & Strøm. Sektor's share of the portfolio was 15 per cent., Partners Group AG's was 75 per cent

<<<

. and Steen and Strøm's was 10 per cent. As part of the agreement, Steen & Strøm disposed their 10 per cent. share in Sektor Portefølje II AS during 2014. As a result, Sektor Portefølje II AS is currently owned 20 per cent. by Sektor and 80

<<<

 per cent. by Partners Group.
55

In 2014, Sektor won another management contract on behalf of Storebrand, taking over responsibility of Ivar Lykkes vei 5 located in close proximity to CitySyd and Tillertorget in Trondheim. Towards the end

<<<

 of the year, the management contracts related to Bryn Senter in Oslo and Kuben Senter at Hønefoss between Sektor and Salto Eiendom AS expired, and Salto took over management themselves, making the total portfolio of Sektor 34 centres, which

<<<

 is the current number of centres under management (managed, owned and leased).
The reconstruction of Buskerud Storsenter and Krokstad Senter in Nedre Eiker was started in 2014. The project comprised retail and office space and combined premises

<<<

. The centres were in need of reconstruction and the intention was to make the centres located close to each other yet again the prime location for shopping experiences in the district. The project is expected to be completed during 2015.
In

<<<

 April 2015, Joh Handel Eiendom AS, Varner Invest AS and K&S Holding AS gained 100 per cent. control of Sektor by purchasing Niam IV Kjøpesenter Holding AS remaining shares in Sektor.
Throughout the years, Sektor has had a number of different

<<<

 ownership constellations; however, the focus and strategy of Sektor Group has remained stable: to become a leading owner, operator and manager of shopping centres in Norway. This has been achieved by using knowledge of the retail market as

<<<

 well as by utilising Sektor's extensive network within the real estate market and within the retail sector. Sektor is as of the date of this Prospectus the second largest shopping centre owner and manager in the Norwegian market.
Legal Structure

<<<


Below is an overview of the legal structure of Sektor companies as of the date of this Prospectus. Sektor is organised into three main property portfolios: Sektor Portefølje III AS (100 per cent. owned by Sektor), Sektor Portefølje I AS (6

<<<

9.21 per cent. owned by Sektor) and Sektor Portefølje Syd AS (100 per cent. owned by Sektor). In addition, Sektor holds a minority stake of 20 per cent. in Sektor Portefølje II AS. The vast majority of the property portfolios are legally organised

<<<

 into one property entity and one corresponding management entity for each shopping centre.

Sektor's Property Portfolio
Shopping Centres
As of 1 January 2015, Sektor owned, leased

<<<

 or managed 34 shopping centres,20 all of which were located in Norway, and which had an estimated gross leasable area of approximately 765,600 sq.m. The owned and leased portfolio comprised an estimated gross leasable area of 504,600 sq.m.

<<<

 (excluding parking). The table below summarises shopping centres owned, leased or managed by Sektor in Norway as of 1 January 2015.
Sektor is as at the date of this Prospectus not required to apply IFRS in its financial reporting and, therefore

<<<

, it prepares its financial statements in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and NGAAP. One of the implications of this is that properties are accounted for at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. A description of the principal

<<<

 differences under IFRS and NGAAP is presented under section "Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information". According to the valuation by the external appraiser DTZ, the market value of Sektor's property portfolio is higher than the recorded value

<<<

 on Sektor's annual accounts as at 31 December 2014. This is partly because Sektor does not apply IFRS accounting principles, and so properties are represented at their acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation.

 Storsenter: Reconstruction and revitalisation of the shopping centre (11,400 sq.m. office and retail areas). Estimated project completion in mid-2015.

 Krokstad Senter: Reconstruction of property into 9,500 sq.m. retail (big box). Estimated

<<<

 project completion during the second half of 2015.

 Kilden: Extension of 7,500 sq.m. retail and office areas. The project also includes the rehabilitation of approximately 5,000 sq.m. of the existing area. Estimated project completion is towards

<<<

 year end 2015.

 Storbyen: Extension of 1,500 sq.m. retail area and rehabilitation of about 7,500 sq.m. existing area. Estimated project completion is during the second half of 2015.

Since 31 December 2014, Sektor has not made other significant

<<<

 investments than the abovementioned, nor has it undertaken any other significant investment commitment. However, Sektor has several development projects under planning that may start later in 2015.

All investments undertaken by Sektor are

Sektor experienced strong growth in gross rental income of 11.9 per cent. in 2014 as compared to 2013.

However, the annual accounts

<<<

 for 2014 are not directly comparable to 2013 because of an acquisition with effect

from 1 April 2013. When adjusting for this acquisition, gross rental income grew 2.4 per cent. in 2014 as

compared to 2013.

The income statement is affected

<<<

 by several development and rehabilitation projects due to reduced or no rental income during rehabilitation or demolition as the premises have not been leasable until completion. Furthermore, under NGAAP, buildings that have been demolished

<<<

 must be written off in the annual accounts, which negatively affects results. The centres that have been affected the most by rehabilitation are Buskerud Storsenter, which is undergoing a full-scale rehabilitation and, therefore, has experienced

<<<

 reduced rental income, and Krokstad Senter, which was demolished in 2014.
Sektor's operating income was NOK 1,108.5 million in 2014 (NOK 1,000.2 million in 2013). Operating profit was NOK 382.3 million (NOK 400.8 million in 2013). Ordinary

<<<

 profit before taxes was NOK 64.1 million (NOK 82.9 million in 2013). Profit for the year was NOK 30.9 million (NOK 104.4 million in 2013). Sektor had a positive tax effect in 2013 of NOK 21.5 million mainly due to tax loss carried forwards

 in acquired companies.

Capital Resources
As of 31 December 2014, Sektor's reported equity was NOK 3,596 million (NOK 3,645 million as of 31 December 2013), which corresponded to an equity ratio of 29.9 per cent. (30.9 per

<<<

 cent. as of 31 December 2013). The decrease in reported equity is mainly due to acquisitions of shares from minority shareholders.
Sektor reports according to NGAAP, which does not require fair value adjustments of, for example, properties

<<<

. Hence, properties are reported at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. The reported figures do not necessarily reflect the market value of Sektor's properties. A description of the principal differences under IFRS and NGAAP is presented

<<<

 under section "Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information".
As of 31 December 2014, Sektor's long-term interest-bearing debt was NOK 7,672 million (NOK 7,456 million as of 31 December 2013). Net interest bearing debt was NOK 7,385 million (NOK

<<<

 7,064 million as of 31 December 2013).
As of 31 December 2014, 51 per cent. of Sektor's long-term debt accrued interest at a fixed interest rate. Debt at a fixed interest had a weighted remaining duration of 3.1 years.
Sektor had a liquidity

<<<

 reserve of NOK 1,002 million as of 31 December 2014. The liquidity reserve comprised NOK 287 million cash and NOK 715 million in untapped drawing rights and loan approvals. Sektor has several development projects in progress. Consequently,

<<<

 NOK 220 million of the NOK 715 million has been drawn from the untapped drawing rights and loan approval reserve as of 30 June 2015. Pursuant to the loan agreement, one of the revolving credit facilities has been reduced by NOK 5.2 million

<<<

 during first half 2015. The current available pool of such rights and approvals was, therefore, reduced to NOK 489.8 million as of 30 June 2015.
Sektor's principal source of liquidity is cash flow from business operations. Sektor's operating

<<<

 cash flow before tax was NOK 248.2 million in 2014 (NOK 176.5 million in 2013). Net cash flow from operational activities was NOK 296.8 million in 2014 (NOK 239.3 million in 2013).
Sektor has sufficient funds to fulfil its financial commitments

<<<

 in connection with ongoing development projects. Sektor has no financial commitments related to other investments beyond these projects.
Sektor is constantly evaluating new projects and investments, and part of the evaluation is to ensure proper

<<<

<<<

<<<

's key personnel. The purpose of the stock options is to encourage the key personnel to work on a long term basis to increase shareholder value. The purpose of the stock options is also to commit key personnel to continued service with the Company

<<<

<<<

<<<

 is in force.
Conflicts of Interest
According to the Board of Directors' independence assessment conducted on 29 April 2015, all Directors are independent of Citycon, given that none of them has an employment contract, executive contract or

<<<

 other contractual relationship with Citycon. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has assessed that Arnold de Haan, Bernd Knobloch, Kirsi Komi, Claes Ottosson and Per-Anders Ovin are independent of significant shareholders. Based on an overall

<<<

 assessment and taking into account that Ariella Zochovitzky's service as Gazit Globe Ltd.'s representative (chairman of the board of directors) in a company called U. Dori Group Ltd., in which Gazit Globe Ltd. exercises a controlling interest

<<<

, had ended in March 2012, the Board of Directors conducted a reassessment and determined that Ariella Zochovitzky is independent of significant shareholders. Since Ronen Ashkenazi, Chaim Katzman and Rachel Lavine are employed by Citycon's main

<<<

 shareholder, Gazit-Globe Ltd. or its affiliated companies, they are not independent of significant shareholders. Since Andrea Orlandi is employed by CPPIB, which wholly owns CPPIBE, a significant shareholder in Citycon, he is not independent

<<<

 of significant shareholders.
Except as discussed immediately above, there is no actual or potential conflict of interests between the duties of any of the members of the Board of Directors or any of the members of the Corporate Management Committee

<<<

 and their respective private interests and/or other duties.
The Governance Agreement regulates certain matters relating to the Company. However, except in relation to matters addressed in the Governance Agreement, there are no measures to regulate

<<<

 the exercise by Gazit Globe Ltd. of its position of control.

CITYCON'S OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS
The following discussion and analysis of Citycon's results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial

<<<

 statements for the financial years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 as well as the interim report for the six months ended 30 June 2015 that have been incorporated in this Prospectus by reference. The discussion includes forward

<<<

-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the sections "Forward-looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" set forth elsewhere in this Prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause Citycon's

<<<

 actual results of operations or financial condition to differ materially from those described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein.
The tables presented in this section present certain consolidated financial information

<<<

 of Citycon that has been derived from the consolidated financial statements of Citycon as of and for the financial years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 and as of and for the six month periods ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014. The consolidated

<<<

 financial statements and the interim reports are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS). The consolidated financial statements as of and for the financial years ended 31 December

<<<

 2014 and 2013 have been audited but the interim report as of and for the six months ended 30 June 2015 is unaudited. For a discussion of key principles applied in the preparation of Citycon's financial statements, see "Critical Accounting Assumptions

<<<

" below.
Overview
Citycon is a leading owner, manager and developer of urban grocery-anchored shopping centres in the Nordic and Baltic regions, with assets under management totalling approximately EUR 4.9 billion (including the fair value of

<<<

 investment properties and joint ventures) and a market cap of approximately EUR 2.0 billion at 30 June 2015. Headquartered in Helsinki, Citycon is the number one shopping centre owner in Finland and among the market leaders in Estonia and Sweden

<<<

.21 Citycon's acquisition of Sektor on 14 July 2015 makes Citycon the largest listed property company in the Nordics. Following the Acquistion, Citycon owns 55 shopping centres in the Nordic countries and Estonia and has increased its total

<<<

 annual footfall from 150 million to over 200 million.
Citycon focuses on leading shopping centres in the Nordic and Baltics. Citycon's properties are urban and typically grocery-anchored. The shopping centres are located close to where people

<<<

 live and work and are easily accessible. Citycon actively (re)develops its centres to ensure their vitality and competitiveness. The large and well-established shopping centres represent the core of the property portfolio. In addition to fully

<<<

 owned properties, Citycon may also be as a co-owner in properties with joint ventures partners. This ownership structure is selected from time to time in major investments in order to free up capital for, among other things, the (re)development

<<<

 of properties in Citycon's shopping centre portfolio.
Citycon's major tenants include specialty and grocery chains as well as cafés and restaurants, banks and financial institutions, and municipal and other public administration.
Citycon's

<<<

 business operations are divided into three business units: Finland, Sweden, and Baltic Countries and New Business (and following the integration of Sektor, Citycon will have a fourth business unit in Norway). These business units are divided

<<<

 into clusters. In the cluster organisational model shopping centres are combined to form entities which are led by commercial directors. As of 30 June 2015, the Finnish unit was composed of three clusters, the Swedish unit of two, and the Baltic

<<<

 Countries and New Business Unit of one cluster. The clusters are supported by centralised leasing, development, marketing and finance teams.
In the financial year ended 31 December 2014, Citycon's turnover was EUR 245.3 million and operating

<<<

 profit EUR 165.0 million, which corresponded to 67.3 per cent. of the turnover. As of 30 June 2015, Citycon had 151 employees of whom 87 were employed in Finland, 50 in Sweden, ten in Estonia, one in Denmark and three in the Netherlands.

Comparability of Financial Information
Following the Acquisition, Citycon consists

<<<

 of the combined businesses of Citycon and Sektor. Given the relative size of Sektor as compared to Citycon and differences in reporting currency and accounting standards applied by Sektor as compared to Citycon (see "Sektor Unaudited Historical

<<<

 Financial Information According to IFRS"), it will be difficult to compare future financial information of the combined entity to the historical financial information of Citycon.
In addition, Citycon's financial statements are not directly

<<<

 comparable for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013. Citycon changed its accounting policy regarding deferred taxes in the third quarter of 2014 and accordingly, this change was applied to the financial information for the year ended 

<<<

31 December 2013 and affects income tax, profit/loss for the period and related line items. For comparison purposes, "Results of Operations ­ Financial Year Ended 31 December 2014 Compared to Financial Year Ended 31 December 2013" below includes

<<<

 the adjusted comparative figures from 2013 as they have been presented in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. Further, Citycon made certain reclassifications and reporting changes in the cash flow statement in the

<<<

 first quarter of 2014 and accordingly, this change was applied to the comparative financial information for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Factors Affecting Results of Operations
The Acquisition
On 14 July 2015, Citycon acquired 100 per cent

<<<

. of the issued and outstanding shares in Sektor. The transaction closed after the reporting period ended 30 June 2015 and as such, the interim report does not include the impact of the Acquisition. The acquisition of Sektor constitutes a material

<<<

 acquisition for Citycon. On a consolidated basis, Sektor represents 29.3 per cent.22 of Citycon's total assets. On a pro forma basis, Citycon's net rental income was EUR 242.0 million, operating profit EUR 259.5 million and profit for the period

<<<

 EUR 121.3 million for the year ending 31 December 2014, representing increases compared to Citycon's actual 2014 results of 42.9 per cent., 57.3 per cent. and 35.3 per cent., respectively.
Following the Acquisition, Citycon has become the second

<<<

 largest shopping centre company in Norway.23 Accordingly, Citycon's results of operations have become dependent on developments in the Norwegian retail property market and the Norwegian economy generally. See "--Economic and Market Conditions

<<<

" below.
For a description of certain risks relating to the Acquisition, see "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to the Acquisition and Sektor's Business".
Rental Rates and Occupancy Levels
Citycon is a real estate company focusing on medium sized

<<<

 grocery-anchored shopping centres across the Nordic region and the Baltics. Citycon owns, leases, manages, develops and redevelops properties. In addition, Citycon plans and commissions the construction of new premises. Citycon generates turnover

<<<

 predominantly from rental income, which is affected by a number of variables. The main variables affecting rental income are the rental rate levels, the occupancy rate of Citycon's properties and decisions with respect to portfolio management

<<<

, i.e. investments and divestments of properties.
The rent for almost half of Citycon's leases consists of two components: the capital rent tied to the cost-of-living index and the maintenance charge24. Thus, the level of rental income of Citycon

<<<

 also depends on inflation rates. Citycon also has turnover-based lease agreements where the rent consists of (i) capital rent, tied to the turnover of the tenant, and (ii) the maintenance charge. In most cases, turnover-based rental agreements

<<<

 also include a minimum rent based on market rent levels that is tied to the cost-of-living index. As of 31 December 2014,
22 Calculated on the basis of the unaudited pro forma financial information.
23 Based on number of shopping centres in

<<<

 Norway under management as of 30 June 2015. The largest shopping centre company in Norway is Olav Thon Gruppen / Amfi with around 96 centres under management in Norway, whilst the third largest shopping centre company in Norway is Steen & Strøm

<<<

 with 13 centres under management in Norway. Source: Nordic Council of Shopping Centres.
24 89 per cent. of all leases as at 31 December 2014.
72

turnover-based rental agreements formed approximately 53 per cent. of Citycon's lease portfolio

<<<

 and the rental income from the turnover-based part of the leases formed approximately 2.0 per cent. of Citycon's gross rental income during the year ended 31 December 2014. In comparison, turnover-based rental agreements formed approximately

<<<

 52 per cent. of Citycon's lease portfolio as of 31 December 2013, and the rental income from the turnover-based part of the leases formed approximately 1.3 per cent. of Citycon's gross rental income during the year ended 31 December 2013.
As

<<<

 nearly all of Citycon's lease agreements are linked to the cost-of-living index, Citycon's rental income is almost fully covered against rising inflation. In addition, pursuant to the majority of Citycon's lease agreements, decreases in the

<<<

 cost-of-living index do not decrease the rent levels, which provides further protection for Citycon during the term of the lease. Upon expiry of the lease, the new rental rate is dependent on the market rental rate at the relevant location

<<<

. Market rental rates and occupancy rate of the properties are, among other things, dependent on the growth rate of retail trade and consumer purchasing power and, with respect to a single property, on its attractiveness.
On average, rent levels

<<<

 for retail premises in Finland have not fluctuated materially during the last few years, but variation from this development appears both by area and by the property in question.25 Rents for prime retail properties in Stockholm have reached

<<<

 pre-economic crisis levels and are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 1,600 per sq.m. per year in 2015.26 From 2010, the top rents for prime retail properties in the Baltic countries have increased. In Tallinn, prime retail rents are

<<<

 estimated to amount to approximately EUR 260 per sq.m. per year in 2015.27 As regards properties owned by Citycon, the net rental income of like-for-like properties28, which reflects the rental income development of Citycon, increased by 2

<<<

.9 per cent. in 2014 as compared to 2013.
Citycon's occupancy rates have remained stable during the past few years. In Finland, the economic occupancy rate was 95.6 per cent. as of 31 December 2014 and 95.1 per cent. as of 31 December 2013.

<<<

 In Sweden, Citycon's economic occupancy rate was 96.1 per cent. as of 31 December 2014 and 95.1 per cent. as of 31 December 2013. In the Baltic Countries and New Business, the economic occupancy rate was 99.3 per cent. as of 31 December 20

<<<

14 and 99.7 per cent. as of 31 December 2013. As of 30 June 2015, the economic occupancy rate in Finland was 95.3 per cent. and in Sweden 96.2 per cent. In the Baltic Countries and New Business, the economic occupancy rate was 98.2 per cent

<<<

. as of 30 June 2015.
Economic and Market Conditions
Real estate markets are cyclical in nature and the condition of the economy as a whole affects property values, property operating expenses, occupancy rates and rental rates. Citycon's performance

<<<

 is subject to, among other things, the conditions of the commercial property market in the regions in which it operates, which affects both the value of any properties that Citycon has or will acquire and the rental income those properties

<<<

 yield. Real economy trends have a significant impact on retail consumption thus affecting the real estate markets and have a direct impact on Citycon's occupancy rates and lease agreement terms (see "Rental Rates and Occupancy Levels").
The

<<<

 economic growth levels in 2015 and prospects for 2016 in the key markets in which Citycon operates are varied. The economy is expected to continue to grow at a slow pace in Finland and Denmark in 2015 and 2016 (GDP growth in 2014 was -0.1 per

<<<

 cent. and 0.8 per cent., respectively), whereas economic growth in Sweden and Estonia is expected to remain at moderate levels (GDP growth in 2014 was 1.8 per cent. and 1.9 per cent., respectively).29 Norway experienced GDP growth of 2.2 per

<<<

 cent. in 2014 and while growth is expected to

continue, the Norwegian economy is heavily exposed to oil prices, and continued low oil prices could have a negative effect

<<<

 on GDP growth prospects. See "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to Citycon's Operating Environment--Economic Fluctuations and Economic Development Have an Adverse Effect on the Real Estate Market and therefore to Citycon's Business and Results of

<<<

 Operations".
Citycon's overall expenses are materially affected by general economic conditions. Citycon's expenses mainly consist of property operating expenses, administrative expenses, financial expenses and taxes. Property operating expenses

<<<

 are mainly dependent on inflation and the price of energy as well as the size and condition of Citycon's property portfolio. The most significant property operating expenses are heating and electricity, maintenance expenses and repair expenses

<<<

. The administrative expenses depend mainly on inflation, the development of salary levels and bonuses, number of personnel, and changes in the regulation on pension and social expenses.
General economic trends also affect Citycon's costs of

<<<

 financing. From 2013, banks' willingness to lend money to real estate companies has increased and loan margins have decreased substantially, but have still not quite reached pre-financial crisis levels. Stricter regulations on banks may increase

<<<

 loan margins of bank financing in the future. All of Citycon's bank loan agreements concluded prior to the financial crisis have been refinanced, leading to somewhat higher loan interest margins. The repayment of bank loans during 2014 was

<<<

 mainly refinanced with the proceeds of equity issues of approximately EUR 400 million in aggregate in June and July, through which CPPIBE became a strategic shareholder in Citycon with a 15 per cent. ownership, and the EUR 350 million Eurobond

<<<

 issued in October 2014 as well as the EUR 500 million bank credit limit signed in December 2014. The total debt profile as of 30 June 2015 comprised (i) bonds, 77 per cent. (30 June 2014: 51 per cent.), (ii) the RCF, 14 per cent. (30 June 

<<<

2014: 0 per cent.), (iii) commercial paper, 8 per cent. (30 June 2014: 4 per cent.), and (iv) other debt, 1 per cent. (30 June 2014: 9 per cent.). As of 30 June 2015, 0 per cent. of debt was contributed from bilateral/syndicated term loans,

<<<

 as compared to 36 per cent. as of 30 June 2014.
Size and Location of Property Portfolio
By fair value, the composition of Citycon's investment property portfolio as of 30 June 2015 was 61 per cent. in Finland, 26 per cent. in Sweden and 12

<<<

 per cent. belonging to the Baltic Countries and New Business unit. As of 30 June 2015, Citycon owned a total of 34 shopping centres: 21 in Finland, nine in Sweden excluding Kista Galleria (in which Citycon owns a 50 per cent. share), three

<<<

 in Estonia, and one in Denmark. In addition to shopping centres, Citycon owned 25 other retail properties (supermarkets and shops) as of 30 June 2015, of which 23 were in Finland and two were in Sweden. See "Citycon's Property Portfolio in

<<<

 Brief and Investments, Divestments and Development Projects". Sektor managed a total of 34 shopping centres in Norway as of 31 March 2015 (20 of which were fully or majority owned by Sektor). See "Description of the Guarantor-- Description

<<<

 of Sektor". The total property portfolio following the Acquisition is approximately EUR 4.9 billion including Kista Galleria.
Citycon's rental income and consequently its results of operations depend significantly on the number of shopping

<<<

 centres and retail properties in its investment property portfolio, as well as the location and quality of such properties. Citycon's properties are typically in urban locations with good access to transportation links. Sektor properties are

<<<

 located mainly (approximately 80 per cent.) in Oslo or in commuter cities in the greater Oslo region, as well as in the Stavanger and Bergen regions (approximately 15 per cent.). Norway's urbanisation pattern differs from other Nordic countries

<<<

; although Oslo is the main urban centre with the strongest growth, there are also relatively small commuter cities (with populations of approximately 30,000­ 70,000), but that exhibit strong population growth and high income levels. The growth

<<<

 of Citycon's business going forward will depend significantly on Citycon's ability to successfully leverage and (re)develop its existing portfolio, including that of Sektor, and to identify and acquire suitable real estate assets that fit with

<<<

 its strategy and that are expected to contribute additional rental or other income to Citycon without incurring disproportionate costs. Following the Acquisition, Citycon's growth will also be affected by its ability to achieve synergies through

<<<

 promotion of international tenancy across the markets in which it operates, including in Norway, and to successfully implement its strategy in the Norwegian market.
Property Values and Valuation
The value of the real estate assets that comprise

<<<

 Citycon's property portfolio has a significant effect on Citycon's financial performance, and changes in the fair value of investment properties is the most significant item
74

affecting Citycon's results of operations. Citycon applies the

<<<

 IAS 40 standard in the valuation of its investment properties, whereby investment property is measured at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair values being included in the statement of comprehensive income. In accordance

<<<

 with IFRS and the International Valuation Standards (IVS), an external professional appraiser conducts a valuation of Citycon's property portfolio on a property-by-property basis at least annually. In recent years, valuations by an external

<<<

 appraiser have been conducted quarterly. Citycon's property valuations were conducted by JLL (formerly Jones Lang LaSalle), which has acted as an external appraiser of Citycon's property assets since the end of year 2011. Citycon has changed

<<<

 its independent external appraiser at regular intervals.

Changes in the fair value of investment properties affect Citycon's statement of comprehensive income but they do not have a direct effect on cash flow. Changes in the fair value of

<<<

 investment property are influenced by, among other things, the market yield requirement, development of market rent levels, property operating expenses and vacancy rate. The measurement of the fair value of Citycon's investment properties is

<<<

 based on a 10-year cash flow analysis based on net rental income of the properties, in which leases valid on the valuation date determine the base cash flow. Upon lease expiry, the market rent assessed by an external appraiser is used to replace

<<<

 the contract rent of the expiring lease agreement. The potential gross rental income of each property includes leased premises with contract rents, vacant premises with market rents and other income such as speciality leasing income. Effective

<<<

 gross rental income is calculated by deducting (i) the assumed general vacancy rate and (ii) the market rent for the time period between an expired rent contract and assumed entry into force of the new rent contract from the potential gross

<<<

 rental income. The external appraiser determines the vacancy period between the expiring contract and assumed entry into force of the new contract as well as the assumed general vacancy rate. Depending on the property in question, the assumed

<<<

 vacancy period varies between a minimum of one month to a maximum of 18 months and the assumed general vacancy rate varies between a minimum of 2 per cent. and a maximum of 10 per cent.

The operating expenses and investments are deducted from

<<<

 the effective gross rental income and the resulting net cash flow is discounted at the discount rate per property. The value of the property is formed of the present value of the annual net cash flows in the cash flow period, the residual value

<<<

 discounted at present and other possible added value such as the value of unused, exploitable building rights.

Sensitivity to change in the properties' fair value, or the risk associated with fair value, can be tested by altering the above

<<<

 key parameters. The sensitivity analysis below uses the investment properties' fair value of EUR 2,801.7 million (excluding Kista Galleria, in which Citycon owns a 50 per cent. share) defined by the external appraiser as of 30 June 2015 as

<<<

 the starting value. According to sensitivity analysis, certain changes would alter the investment properties' fair value as of 30 June 2015 as follows:

Yield requirement +5 per cent. Rental income +5 per cent. Vacancy rate +1 percentage point

<<<


Operating expenses +5 per cent.

 Fair market value 2,668.2 million euro  Fair market value 2,988.9 million euro  Fair market value 2,759.2 million euro
 Fair market value 2,750.2 million euro

While Citycon cannot influence the yield requirements

<<<

, it seeks to have an impact on the other fair value variables through active shopping centre management. Citycon aims to optimise the profitability of its shopping centres by conducting the entire shopping centre management process in-house

<<<

 with the help of its own employees.

The fair value of Citycon's investment properties on the balance sheet equals the property portfolio's total value determined by the external appraiser plus the value of new properties acquired during the

<<<

 reporting quarter and such investments in development projects that the external appraiser does not take into account in the valuation. As of 30 June 2015, the fair value of Citycon's investment properties on the balance sheet amounted to EUR

<<<

 2,819.6 million, of which EUR 18.0 million consisted of investments in potential development projects that have not been taken into account by the external appraiser in valuing the investment properties' fair value for the purposes of its valuation

<<<

 statement (see further "Citycon's Property Portfolio in Brief and Investments, Divestments and Development Projects").

Recent Developments
On 15 June 2015, Citycon's Board of Directors decided on a rights issue (the Rights Issue) of approximately

<<<

 EUR 600 million based on the authorisation granted by the EGM as part of the financing arrangements relating to the Acquisition. A maximum of 296,664,209 new shares were offered for subscription at a price of EUR 2.05 in accordance with the

<<<

 shareholders' pre-emptive subscription right. The offered shares represented a maximum of approximately 50.0 per cent. of the total shares in the company at the period-end. The company's two largest shareholders Gazit-Globe Ltd. and CPPIBE

<<<

 had, subject to certain conditions, undertaken to subscribe to their respective pro rata share in the Rights Issue and committed to additional undertakings to subscribe, subject to certain conditions, for further shares in the Rights Issue

<<<

 up to a maximum amount of EUR 80 million. The subscription period began on 23 June 2015 and ended on 7 July 2015. All offered 296,664,209 shares were subscribed for. Pursuant to their subscription undertakings, Gazit-Globe Ltd. and CPPIBE subscribed

<<<

 for shares in the Rights Issue as follows: Gazit-Globe Ltd. 127,068,487 shares and CPPIBE 44,499,631 shares, representing approximately 57.8 per cent. of the shares offered. The subscribed shares represent approximately 33.3 per cent. of the

<<<

 total shares and voting rights in the company after the Rights Issue. The new shares were entered in the Finnish Trade Register and public trading in the new shares commenced on the Helsinki Stock Exchange on 14 July 2015. The subscription

<<<

 price was recognized under the invested unrestricted equity fund. Following the Rights Issue the total number of shares outstanding in the company is 889,992,628 as of 14 July 2015.
On 14 July 2015 Citycon announced the completion of the acquisition

<<<

 of all the shares in the Norwegian shopping centre company Sektor. The debt-free total purchase price payable by Citycon for all of the shares in Sektor was EUR 1,467 million. The cash purchase price of approximately EUR 540 million was paid

<<<

 in connection with the closing of the transaction. Citycon financed a part of the acquisition through the Rights Issue. In connection with the closing of the transaction Citycon announced that Eirik Thrygg has been appointed to Citycon Oyj

<<<

's Corporate Management Committee, and Citycon announced on 10 August 2015 that Mr. Thrygg will remain at Citycon until the end of 2015 to assist in supporting Citycon with the integration of Sektor.
On 14 July 2015 Citycon announced the signing

<<<

 of an agreement to sell the non-core shopping centre Strömpilen in Umeå for approximately EUR 39 million. The disposal price is somewhat below the IFRS second quarter fair value.
On 15 July 2015 Citycon announced it entered into an agreement

<<<

 to sell the non-core portfolio of 13 grocery store properties in Finland for approximately EUR 76 million. The disposal price is slightly below the IFRS fair value for the properties.
On 24 August 2015, Citycon announced its placement of notes

<<<

 in an aggregate principal amount of NOK 2.65 billion. The issuance consists of two tranches: NOK 1.4 billion with an interest rate of 3.90 per cent. and maturing in 2025 and NOK 1.25 billion with a floating interest rate and maturing in 20

<<<

21. The bonds were issued on 1 September 2015.
Critical Accounting Policies
Citycon's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 2014 and 2013 as well as the interim reports as of and for the six months ended 30 June 201

<<<

5 and 2014 were prepared in accordance with IFRS. The appliance of IFRS requires the management to give estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of revenues, assets and liabilities. The items below are the key principles used in

<<<

 the preparation of Citycon's financial statements:
 Mutual real estate companies refer to joint operations included in the consolidated financial statements using proportionated consolidation, in accordance with IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements,

<<<

 whereby Citycon's share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of Citycon is combined line by line with similar items in Citycon's financial statements.
 Investment property is property (land or building ­ or part of a building ­ or

<<<

 both) held to earn rental income or capital gains or both. In the valuation of investment properties, Citycon has decided to use the fair value model in compliance with the IAS 40 standard, which results in changes in value being
76

posted

<<<

 to the income statement. In accordance with IFRS 13, the fair value is defined as the amount for which an asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value is measured using the

<<<

 assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. An investment property's fair value reflects the current market circumstances on the balance-sheet

<<<

 date, taking into account prices paid for similar properties with comparable location, condition and lease portfolio. All investment properties are categorised within a fair value hierarchy, based on the lowest level input that is significant

<<<

 to the fair value measurement as a whole. The value of Citycon's investment properties is assessed in accordance with International Valuation Standards (IVS) at least annually by an external professional appraiser. A cash flow analysis based

<<<

 on the net rental yield is used to determine the fair value of investment properties and yield requirement, market rents, operating expenses and vacancy rate form the key variables used in the investment property's fair value measurement. The

<<<

 cash flow analysis is prepared for each property and the total value of the property portfolio is calculated as the sum of the value of the individual properties based on the cash flow method. Measuring the fair value of investment property

<<<

 is the most significant component of the financial statements of Citycon and it involves the management's judgment and assumptions about future uncertainties. Development properties are also measured at fair value instead of at cost.
 Property

<<<

 (other than investment property), plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost and depreciated over the estimated economic lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over ten years. Other property

<<<

, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of three to ten years.
 Intangible assets include mainly software licenses. They are recorded at historical cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over three

<<<

 to seven years.
 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are assessed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment

<<<

 loss is recognised in the income statement if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
 Revenue comprises mainly rental income from investment property. Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease

<<<

.
 Leases for which Citycon acts as a lessee are classified as finance leases and recognised as assets and liabilities if the risks and rewards have been transferred. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not substantially transfer

<<<

 all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.
 Employee pension coverage has been arranged through statutory pension insurance. The contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which

<<<

 they relate.
 IFRS 2 Share-based payment -standard has been applied to all existing share and option based incentive plans of Citycon. For such option plans and share-based incentive plans, the fair value of the equity instruments granted is

<<<

 measured at granted date and the options and share-based incentive plans are expensed over the vesting period of the instrument.
 The transaction costs related to the raising of new equity financing have been treated as a reduction of the proceeds

<<<

 of such equity offering with an adjustment for income tax.
 Interest rate derivatives are used as hedging instruments. They are designated as cash flow hedges of the future interest payments on variable rate liabilities. Hedging instruments

<<<

 are measured at fair value and the change in value that relates to the effective part of the hedge is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income under other comprehensive income in the financial statements and interim reports. The

<<<

 ineffective part, if any, is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income under financial expenses.
 Provisions are recognised when Citycon has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, when it is probable

<<<

 that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
77

's financial risk arises from financial instruments which are mainly used to raise financing for operations. Citycon also has interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives which are used to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising

<<<

 from the operations and financing sources. Citycon's identified, key financial risks include interest rate risk related to cash flow, liquidity risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, electricity price risk and foreign currency risk. The Board

<<<

 of Directors has approved a Treasury Policy that defines the objectives, responsibilities and risk management indicators applicable to these risks. The execution of risk management is done by the Group Treasurer under the supervision of the

 INFORMATION
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
This pro forma financial information section has been prepared to show how the Acquisition, as further described under "Citycon's Operating and Financial Review and Prospects--Factors Affecting

<<<

 Results of Operations--The Acquisition" might have affected the Company's financial information had it occurred at an earlier date.
General information and purpose of the unaudited pro forma financial information
In the preparation of the pro

<<<

 forma information, the Citycon Group has chosen to follow the IFRS 3 (Business Combination) standard, consistent with the anticipated treatment under IFRS in the Group's financial statements. The unaudited pro forma financial information set

<<<

 out below has been prepared by the Group to show how the Acquisition might have affected the Group's statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2014 had the Acquisition occurred on 1 January 2014 and the statement of financial

<<<

 position as of 31 December 2014 as if the Acquisition had occurred on the balance sheet date.
The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared in accordance with Annex II of Regulation (EC) 809/2004, as amended. It should be

<<<

 noted that the unaudited pro forma financial information has not been prepared in connection with an offering registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the U.S. Securities Act and consequently is not compliant

<<<

 with the SEC's rules on presentation of pro forma financial information. As such, a U.S. investor should not place reliance on the unaudited pro forma financial information included in this Prospectus or the assurance report included in Appendix

<<<

 3.
The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments, for the purpose of deriving the unaudited pro forma financial information, are described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma financial information. The IFRS adjustments from NGAAP

<<<

 for Sektor are discussed in "--Sektor Unaudited Historical Financial Information According to IFRS". Neither these adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma financial information have been audited in accordance with Finnish, International

<<<

 or United States generally accepted auditing standards, and the unaudited pro forma financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the SEC or generally accepted practice in the United States

<<<

. In evaluating the unaudited pro forma financial information, each reader should carefully consider the audited historical financial statements and the notes thereto and the notes to the unaudited pro forma financial information.
The pro forma

<<<

 financial information does not include all of the information required for financial statements under IFRS. The pro forma financial information does not represent the actual combination of the financial statements of the Company and Sektor

<<<

 in accordance with IFRS. Furthermore, the pro forma financial information is based on certain assumptions that would not necessarily have been applicable if the Company had ownership of these assets from the beginning of the period presented

<<<

 in the pro forma financial information.
The pro forma information describes a hypothetical situation. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only to show how the Acquisition might have affected

<<<

 the Group's consolidated income statement for 2014 if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014, and the unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2014, as if the acquisition had occurred at the balance sheet date. Because

<<<

 of its nature, the unaudited pro forma financial information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent the Citycon's actual financial position or results if the Acquisition had in fact occurred on those dates, and

<<<

 is not representative of the results of operations for any future periods. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this unaudited pro forma financial information.
The pro forma information must not be considered final or complete

<<<

, and may be amended in future publications of accounts. The pro forma information has not been audited.
Basis and Source for the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The pro forma information presented in this section of the Prospectus

<<<

 has been based on the audited 2014 annual financial statements for Citycon and Sektor. For more information, see "Citycon's Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" and "Sektor Unaudited Historical Financial Information According to IFRS

Combined loan-to-value (LTV) of Citycon and Sektor is approximately 45 per cent.
Overview of the pro forma adjustments
The following information summarises the adjustments related

<<<

 to the unaudited pro forma income statement for 2014 and the unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of 31 December 2014. The adjustments are referenced in the table columns above.
Notes to the pro forma adjustments:
1. Adjustment 1) in the income

<<<

 statement relates to the annual amortisation expense for the intangible assets acquired in the Acquisition. The intangible assets, except goodwill, are amortised over their average estimated useful life. Pro forma amortisation expense is estimated

<<<

 at EUR 1.3 million for 2014. Deferred taxes related to the amortisation expense are estimated at EUR 0.4 million.
These pro forma adjustments have continuing impact.
2. Adjustment 2) in the income statement relates to the transaction costs

<<<

 associated with the purchase of Sektor. The Citycon Group has incurred costs in the estimated amount of EUR 7.6 million for execution of the Acquisition which are not considered directly related to the issue of equity, and therefore deemed

<<<

 as profit and loss expense items under IFRS as part of administrative expenses. The transaction costs are reflected in the pro forma balance sheet as an adjustment to retained earnings and accrued as part of Trade and other payables. There

<<<

 is no deferred tax or current tax associated with the transaction costs.
These pro forma adjustments do not have continuing impact.
3. Adjustment 3) is the purchase price allocation (PPA).32 In connection with the acquisition, Citycon is required

<<<

 to perform a purchase price allocation in accordance with IFRS. The PPA exercise has identified the following adjustments, shown in the table below. This resulted in an increase in the carrying value of investment properties by EUR 104 million

<<<

 and a net change in other assets and liabilities of EUR 4 million. Total goodwill from the acquisition is EUR 118.8 million.33
Citycon has elected the accounting principle option to not measure non-controlling interests at acquisition-date

1 Valuations of investment property, bonds, etc. are adjusted in the PPA adjustments to comply with the time of acquisition (when the PPA has been made).

4. The Group has incurred costs for execution of the Acquisition which are not considered

<<<

 directly related to the issue of equity, and therefore deemed as profit and loss expense items under IFRS, which are reflected in the pro forma balance sheet as an adjustment to retained earnings, in the estimated amount of EUR 7.6 million

<<<

. Net cash to be received from the issuance of new equity is estimated at EUR 604 million, based on the Rights Issue being fully subscribed. The Rights Issue is not underwritten. The Company has agreed on bridge financing facilities of EUR 

<<<

400 million, to be used to partly finance the Acquisition.

This pro forma adjustment is considered as non-recurring.

5. Sektor is subject to corporate income tax in Norway. The Group has chosen to give effect in the pro forma adjustments by

<<<

 using the relevant statutory rate which would be expected to apply to the adjustments had they happened in the period presented. Since pro forma information is hypothetical information, the actual deductibility and eventual tax impact of the

<<<

 Acquisition will not mirror the tax effect included here and may be subject to discussion with relevant tax authorities. However, consistent with IFRS, the Group has given effect to possible taxation on the adjustments by using the relevant

<<<

 statutory rate of 27 per cent.
This pro forma adjustment is considered as non-recurring.

Citycon's management has not identified any other adjustments that would materially affect Citycon's pro forma financial information for use in this Prospectus

<<<

, or any other adjustments that were necessary in order for the pro forma consolidated information of the Group to be stated in accordance with IFRS for pro forma purposes for use in this Section "Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information".

Sektor Unaudited Historical Financial Information according to IFRS
The Citycon audited consolidated financial statements are prepared according to IFRS as adopted by the EU (IFRS). The audited consolidated financial statements of Sektor are

<<<

 prepared according to NGAAP.
Based on an analysis performed by Citycon's management of the applied NGAAP accounting principles of Sektor, differences between NGAAP and Citycon's IFRS accounting policies and financial statement presentation

<<<

 were identified. All NGAAP to IFRS differences as of 31 December 2014 and for the year then ended evaluated by management as relevant and significant for the purposes of the pro forma presentation as discussed in section "Unaudited Pro Forma

<<<

 Financial Information" have been adjusted in the unaudited IFRS consolidated financial statements presented below. All presentation and line item classification differences

93

considered relevant have been reclassified. The purpose of these

<<<

 unaudited consolidated IFRS financial information is to provide a basis for the presentation of the pro forma financial information for Citycon as discussed in section "Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information" and not to report Sektor as

 a separate entity in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The tables below include:

 in the audited financial statements. Sektor IFRS financial information is presented using Citycon's presentation format and presentation currency EUR. Following the Sektor IFRS financial information is a discussion of the NGAAP to IFRS adjustments

<<<

 and reclassifications.
The NGAAP to IFRS conversion was performed by first converting the 2014 beginning balance sheet to IFRS. All identified opening balance sheet differences were posted as adjustments to opening retained earnings, for a

<<<

 total adjustment of EUR -93.8 million. The conversion effect from NGAAP to IFRS on the 31 December 2014 NGAAP retained earnings was an increase of EUR 40.5 million, for a total conversion effect on retained earnings of EUR -53.2 million. This

<<<

 EUR -53.2 million decrease is discussed in further detail below.

Overview of the NGAAP to IFRS adjustments and reclassifications

The following information summarises the NGAAP ­ IFRS adjustments related to the unaudited Sektor consolidated

<<<

 statement of income for 2014 and the 31 December 2014 statement of financial position. The numbering is referenced from the numbered line items in the balance sheet. Conversion from NOK to EUR is at the average exchange rate of NOK/EUR 8.3

<<<

544 for the profit or loss and NOK/EUR 9.0365 for the balance sheet.

Notes to IFRS adjustments and reclassifications:

1.

In accordance with NGAAP, Sektor has recognised investment property at historical cost with annual

depreciation. Under

<<<

 IFRS there is an accounting policy choice to recognise investment property at

historical cost or fair value. Citycon has decided to use the fair value model in compliance with IAS

40, which results in changes in fair value being posted to

<<<

 the income statement and no recognition of

depreciation. The investment property is therefore recognised at a fair value of EUR 1,308.3 million

(NOK 11,823 million) as of 31 December 2014 and NGAAP 2014 depreciation of EUR 22.3 million



<<<

(NOK 186 million) is adjusted in the profit or loss, as well as the 2014 change in fair value of the

investment property is recognised as a gain in fair value of EUR 35.3 million (NOK 295 million). An

increase in deferred tax liabilities related

<<<

 to investment property is recognised in the amount of EUR

14.4 million (NOK 130 million).

Leased investment property operated under an operating lease is not recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position. Leasehold improvements

<<<

 are at historical cost less depreciation. Citycon uses the IFRS accounting principle option to present leased investment property at fair value, as if it was a financial lease, with a corresponding in increase in the interest-bearing debt related

<<<

 to the leased property.

Development projects are included in the same balance sheet line item as investment property and are measured for under IFRS at fair value.

2.

In accordance with NGAAP, Sektor has accounted for their 20 per cent.

<<<

 investment in an associated

company using the equity method and based upon underlying NGAAP financial statements. IFRS also

requires use of the equity method, but with application based on underlying IFRS financial statements

99

for the

<<<

 associate that are consistent with those of the group. Therefore, the associate's financial statements were converted to IFRS before application of the equity method. Adjustments were made to recognise investment property and derivative financial

<<<

 instruments at fair value, as well as the related deferred tax effect of these adjustments. These adjustments, including the effect of the deferred taxes, resulted in an increase in the share of the result in the associate of EUR 1.7 million

<<<

 (NOK 14,174 thousand) and a similar increase in the balance sheet in the investments in associated companies. There is no deferred tax impact related to the equity method posting of EUR 1.7 million in the financial statements.

3.

In accordance

<<<

 with NGAAP, Sektor has accounted for deferred taxes at net present value. In

accordance with IAS 12, an adjustment has been made to present deferred taxes under IFRS at nominal

value. This adjustment resulted in a net increase in deferred

<<<

 tax liabilities of EUR 93.2 million (NOK

842 million). The net effect of all deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability adjustments is a decrease

of retained earnings of EUR 107.4 million (NOK 970 million).

4.

In accordance with NGAAP

<<<

 hedge accounting, Sektor has not recognised their interest rate swap

derivative contracts in the financial statements. Under IFRS, these derivative contracts do not qualify

for hedge accounting, and are therefore recognised at fair value

<<<

 over the profit or loss. Interest rate

swaps are recognised in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities, respectively with a value of EUR 2.2

million (NOK 19 million) and EUR 22.6 million (NOK 205 million) as of 31 December 2014. A net

<<<



deferred tax asset of EUR 5.5 million (NOK 50 million) is recognised in the balance sheet related to all

of the derivatives, of which the majority is presented net of deferred tax liabilities. The net profit or

loss effect from the derivative

<<<

 financial instruments in 2014 is a loss of EUR 11.7 million (NOK 98

million). A net decreased tax expense of EUR 3.1 million (NOK 26 million) is recognised in the 2014

IFRS income statement.

5.

In accordance with NGAAP, Sektor has recognised

<<<

 goodwill in connection with business

combinations, which is amortised over the useful life of five years. IFRS does not permit goodwill

amortisation and instead requires goodwill to be tested annually for impairment. Accumulated

amortisation

<<<

 as of 31 December 2014 of EUR 0.1 million (NOK 1 million) has been reversed. IFRS

goodwill as of 31 December is EUR 0.4 million (NOK 3.5 million), and is considered not to be

impaired. There is no deferred tax impact related to the goodwill

<<<

 adjustment.

6.

The change in total shareholders' equity of EUR 53.1 million (NOK 480 million) is further detailed in

the NGAAP to IFRS equity reconciliation given below. Non-controlling interests has been adjusted by

EUR 3.2 million (NOK

<<<

 29 million) to reflect the transition to IFRS within the sub-consolidation group

where there is a minority interest.

7.

In accordance with NGAAP, Sektor has recognised long-term debt at nominal values, as well as

capitalised the debt origination

<<<

 fees, and amortised these fees straight-line over the life of the loan.

Sektor has also classified accrued interest as part of short-term debt in the statement of financial

position. IFRS requires recognition of interest expense and debt

<<<

 at amortised cost (or fair value), and

Citycon elects to measure debt at amortised cost. All long-term loans were converted to an amortised

cost model, and the capitalised origination fee and related NGAAP amortisation reversed. EUR 1.1


<<<


million (NOK 10 million) of accrued interest has been reclassified to IFRS long-term debt. The total

NGAAP to IFRS adjustment was an increase in 31 December 2014 long-term debt of EUR 9.3 million

(NOK 84 million) and a profit or loss decrease

<<<

 in financial expense of EUR 1.7 million (NOK 14

million).

8.

Under NGAAP all debt was classified in the balance sheet as long-term. IFRS requires the portion of

debt due and payable within the next operating cycle to be classified as short

<<<

-term. EUR 52.9 million

(NOK 478 million) of debt was therefore reclassified as short-term loans. Additionally, the NGAAP

balance sheet classified accrued interest related to the inflation-adjusted debt as short-term, and this has

been reclassified

<<<

 as long-term for IFRS presentation purposes.

Sektor has presented their financial statements using a NGAAP presentation format. For purposes of the NGAAP to IFRS conversion and subsequent presentation of the pro forma financial statements

<<<

, the Sector NGAAP financial statements were reclassified to the Citycon presentation format. Reclassifications were made from a NGAAP line item to the Citycon IFRS balance sheet line item for goodwill, derivatives, debt and current tax liabilities

<<<

, such that the starting point for the presentation of the financial information given above is the Citycon presentation format. In the profit or loss, the Sektor NGAAP line item depreciation is included in the Citycon line item Administrative

<<<

 expenses, and Sektor NGAAP line item Other operating expenses are reclassified to property operating expenses. The gain / loss on derivatives is classified as a financial expense and financial income related to the associate is reclassified

<<<

 to the Citycon presentation line item Share of profit joint venture.

Citycon management has not identified any other adjustments from NGAAP to IFRS that would materially affect the Citycon pro forma information to be stated in accordance with

<<<

 IFRS for pro forma purposes for use in this Prospectus.

CITYCON'S PROPERTY PORTFOLIO IN BRIEF AND INVESTMENTS, DIVESTMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

Overview
On 30 June 2015, Citycon owned a total of 35 shopping centres: 21 in Finland

<<<

, 10 in Sweden including Kista Galleria, three in Estonia and one in Denmark. In addition to shopping centres, Citycon owns 25 other retail properties (supermarkets and shops), 23 in Finland and two in Sweden. The total leasable area of Citycon

<<<

's assets under management amounted to 1,026,540 sq.m. on 30 June 2015. On 14 July 2015, Citycon acquired Sektor in Norway. The property portfolio of Sektor is described under Section "Description of the Guarantor-- Description of Sektor--Sektor

<<<

's Property Portfolio".

Fair value of investment properties
The fair value of the Company's investment property portfolio as of 30 June 2015 was EUR 2,819.6 million. The Finnish properties accounted for EUR 1,724.8 million (61 per cent.), the

<<<

 Swedish properties EUR 743.1 million (26 per cent.) and the properties belonging to the Baltic Countries and New Business unit EUR 351.8 million (12 per cent.).

In accordance with IFRS, International Accounting Standards (IAS) and the International

<<<

 Valuation Standards (IVS), an external professional appraiser conducts the fair value valuation of Citycon's investment properties at least annually. In recent years, an evaluation by an external appraiser has been conducted quarterly. The

<<<

 valuation is primarily carried out as a cash flow analysis of the net operating income for a period of ten years according to which the basic cash flow is determined by valid lease agreements and property operating expenses valid at the time

<<<

 of valuation. Since the end of 2011, Citycon's property valuation has been conducted by the global property specialist JLL (former Jones Lang LaSalle). On 31 December 2014, the valuation average yield requirement by JLL for Citycon's whole

<<<

 property portfolio amounted to 6.1 per cent. One year earlier, on 31 December 2013, the average yield requirement amounted to 6.3 per cent. The average net yield requirement for properties in Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic Countries and New

<<<

 Business was 6.1 per cent., 5.7 per cent. and 7.2 per cent., respectively. On 30 June 2015, the average net yield requirement for Citycon's investment properties was 6.1 per cent. The most recent valuation statement of Citycon's properties

<<<

 as at 30 June 2015 by JLL is incorporated in this Prospectus by reference. The table below describes the fair value of Citycon's investment properties as at 30 June 2015, 31 March 2015, 31 December 2014, 30 September 2014 and 30 June 2014 according

The fair value of Citycon's investment properties as valued by the external appraiser JLL differs from the fair value used in the Company's consolidated statement of financial position due to the fact that

<<<

 the fair value of Citycon's investment properties in the consolidated statement of financial position equals the property portfolio's total value determined by the external appraiser, the value of new properties acquired during the reporting

<<<

 quarter, investments in development projects under planning that the external appraiser does not take into account in the valuation and transfer into investment properties held for sale. Citycon's consolidated statement of financial position

<<<

 can include a separate line item 'Investment properties held-for-sale', which includes such investment properties where a sale is deemed highly probable or a disposal agreement has been signed but the transactions has not been completed on

<<<

 the reporting date.
At 31 December 2014, the fair value of the Company's property portfolio totalled EUR 2,769.1 million, an increase of EUR 35.6 million from the value at the end of 2013 (EUR 2,733.5 million) due to gross capital

102

expenditure

<<<

 of EUR 95.9 million, offset by divestments totalling EUR 27.7 million and transfers of certain residential units in Sweden and some supermarket and shop units in Sweden and Finland into the 'Investment Property Held for Sale' category, amounting

<<<

 to EUR 7.2 million. In addition, net fair value gains on investment properties increased the value of investment properties by EUR 15.7 million. Exchange rate changes decreased the fair value of investment properties by EUR 40.9 million. At

<<<

 30 June 2015, the fair value of Citycon's property portfolio totalled EUR 2,819.6 million. The fair value of investment properties increased by EUR 50.5 million from the end of 2014 (31 December 2014: EUR 2,769.1 million) due to gross capital

<<<

 expenditure of EUR 45.8 million and net fair value gains of EUR 3.0 million. In addition, exchange rate changes increased the fair value of investment properties by EUR 13.7 million, offset by a decrease of EUR 12.0 million as two small non

-core properties were moved to investment properties held for sale.

Property Portfolio ­ Finland

Property Investments and Divestments and Development Projects
An integral part of Citycon's growth strategy has been property

<<<

 acquisitions, through which Citycon has grown in Finland and expanded its operations into Sweden, Estonia and Denmark. Through the Acquisition, Citycon has also entered the Norwegian market. Alongside its property portfolio's growth, Citycon

<<<

 has concentrated on the development of its existing shopping centres. Citycon continuously monitors the real estate market for prospective acquisitions. In accordance with its strategy, Citycon has divested non-core properties in Finland, Sweden

<<<

 and Lithuania in order to be able to better focus on core shopping centres and other large retail properties. Citycon intends to continue the divestment of its non-core properties to improve the property portfolio and strengthen the balance

<<<

 sheet and to partially refinance the bridge financing for the Acquisition and Sektor's bank debt.

In addition to independent acquisitions, Citycon's strategy includes building joint venture partnerships with topquality Finnish and international

<<<

 players in selected core properties. At the end of 2014, Citycon had two joint venture partners, CPPIB and Ilmarinen. In addition, NCC Property Development acts as Citycon's development partner in the Iso Omena and Mölndal Galleria projects

<<<

. Citycon may also divest to an external investor part of any of its properties that are considered part of the core business, provided that management finds it to be beneficial for Citycon.

In 2014, Citycon Group acquired GIC's 40 per cent

<<<

. minority stake in the Iso Omena shopping centre in Espoo and thus gained 100 per cent. ownership of the property. Citycon Group also acquired the plot of shopping centre Arabia in Helsinki.

In December 2014, the Mandarinas shopping centre

<<<

 in Lithuania was sold for approximately EUR 12.5 million, representing a close to 10 per cent. premium to valuation. In line with Citycon's divestment strategy, in 2014 a portfolio of six Finnish supermarkets and shops was divested for EUR

<<<

 6.7 million along with four other single supermarket and shop properties and one non-core shopping centre.

Overview of Investments, Divestments and Development Projects in 2015
Citycon continues building its platform in Denmark and has in

<<<

 January 2015 signed an agreement with TK Development regarding the future purchase of the Straedet project in Køge in the greater Copenhagen area. TK

107

Development is developing an urban, grocery-anchored open-air shopping centre in the

<<<

 heart of Køge, next to the train station. Citycon will acquire the property at completion based on a fixed 6.25 per cent. net initial yield. The purchase price is estimated to be approximately EUR 75 million. TK Development started the construction

<<<

 during Q1/2015 and the project is scheduled to open in phases with final completion in Q2/2017 at which time Citycon will acquire the property.

Citycon has two (re)development projects in the pipeline in Sweden: Mölndals Galleria in Gothenburg

<<<

 and Tumba Centrum in Stockholm. The Mölndal Galleria (re)development project entails the construction of a new shopping centre replacing the old retail property. The estimated project investment is EUR 120 million. The Tumba Centrum (re)development

<<<

 project includes an extension combined with a new bus terminal. The estimated project investment is EUR 53 million.

On 14 July 2015 Citycon acquired all the shares in the Norwegian shopping centre company Sektor. In relation to the financing

<<<

 of the Acquisition, Citycon arranged the equity Rights Issue with gross proceeds of approximately EUR 600 million, entered into bridge financing facilities and waived Sektor's existing bank debt to remain in place after closing.

In June 2

<<<

015, Citycon entered into contracts to divest two small non-core properties located in Finland and Sweden at a total sales price of approximately EUR 14 million. In July 2015, Citycon signed an agreement to sell the non-core shopping centre

<<<

 Strömpilen in Umeå, Sweden, at a sales price of approximately EUR 39 million and an agreement to sell a portfolio of 13 non-core grocery store properties in Finland which have a total value of approximately EUR 76 million. In July 2015, Citycon

<<<

 also divested the non-core shopping centre Galleria in Oulu, Finland, and the Citytalo property next to Galleria, at a total sales price of EUR 13 million.

(Re)development Projects in Progress
Citycon divides its investment properties into

<<<

 two categories: Investment Properties under Construction and Operative Investment Properties. At the date of this Prospectus, the first mentioned category includes shopping centre IsoKristiina in Lappeenranta, Finland, shopping centre Iso Omena

<<<

 in Helsinki area, Finland and shopping centre Stenungstorg in the greater Gothenburg area in Sweden.

The table below presents the Company's development projects approved by the Board of Directors that were in progress as of 30 June 2015. The

In addition to

 the above presented development projects already decided by the Company's Board of Directors, there are several (re)development projects under consideration whose planning process has not yet arrived at the decision stage or that do not require

 the decision of the Board, for example because of the size of the project. All projects under consideration may change, for example due to circumstances relating to city planning and zoning.

108

Due to the market uncertainty, the initiation

 of planned projects will be carefully evaluated against strict preleasing criteria. The most significant (re)development project that is under consideration by Citycon is Shopping Centre Lippulaiva in Helsinki area, Finland. Zoning process

 is ongoing due to the plans to extend the western metro line and build a new bus terminal next to Lippulaiva. The estimated project investment is around EUR 50­70 million.

 tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant to a holder or prospective holder of Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as trusts or similar arrangements

<<<

) may be subject to special rules. In view of its general nature, it should be treated with corresponding caution. Holders or prospective holders of Notes should consult with their tax advisers with regard to the tax consequences of investing

<<<

 in the Notes due to their particular circumstances. The discussion below is included for general information purposes only.

Except as otherwise indicated, this summary only addresses Netherlands national tax legislation and published regulations

<<<

, whereby the Netherlands means the part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands located in Europe, as in effect on the date hereof and as interpreted in published case law until this date, without prejudice to any amendment introduced at a later

<<<

 date and implemented with or without retroactive effect.

Withholding tax

All payments of principal and/or interest made by the Issuer under the Notes may be made free of withholding or deduction of, for or on account of any taxes of whatever

<<<

 nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless the Notes qualify as equity of the Issuer for Netherlands tax purposes.

Taxes on income and capital

<<<

 gains

Please note that the summary in this section does not describe the Netherlands tax consequences for:

(i)

holders of Notes if such holders, and in the case of individuals, his/her partner or certain of their

relatives by blood or marriage

<<<

 in the direct line (including foster children), have a substantial interest or

deemed substantial interest in the Issuer under The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 (in Dutch: "Wet

inkomstenbelasting 2001"). Generally speaking, a holder of

<<<

 securities in a company is considered to

hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or, in the case of individuals, together

with his or her partner (as defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001), directly or indirectly

<<<

,

holds (i) an interest of 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of that company or of 5%

or more of the issued and outstanding capital of a certain class of shares of that company; or (ii) rights

to acquire, directly or

<<<

 indirectly, such interest; or (iii) certain profit sharing rights in that company that

relate to 5% or more of the company's annual profits and/or to 5% or more of the company's liquidation

proceeds. A deemed substantial interest may arise

<<<

 if a substantial interest (or part thereof) in a

company has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, on a non-recognition basis;

(ii) pension funds, investment institutions (in Dutch: "fiscale beleggingsinstellingen"), exempt

<<<

 investment institutions (in Dutch: "vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen") (as defined in The Netherlands Corporate Income Tax Act 1969; in Dutch: "Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969") and other entities that are, in whole or in part, not

<<<

 subject to or exempt from Netherlands corporate income tax; and

(iii) holders of Notes who are individuals for whom the Notes or any benefit derived from the Notes are a remuneration or deemed to be a remuneration for activities performed

<<<

 by such holders or certain individuals related to such holders (as defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001).

Residents of the Netherlands

Generally speaking, if the holder of Notes is an entity that is a resident or deemed to be resident

<<<

 of the Netherlands for Netherlands corporate income tax purposes, any payment under the Notes or any gain or loss realised on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Notes is subject to Netherlands corporate income tax at a rate

110

of 2

<<<

0% with respect to taxable profits up to 200,000 and 25% with respect to taxable profits in excess of that amount.

If a holder of Notes is an individual, resident or deemed to be resident of the Netherlands for Netherlands income tax purposes

<<<

, any payment under the Notes or any gain or loss realised on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Notes is taxable at the progressive income tax rates (with a maximum of 52%), if:

(i)

the Notes are attributable to an enterprise from which

<<<

 the holder of Notes derives a share of the profit,

whether as an entrepreneur or as a person who has a co entitlement to the net worth (in Dutch:

"medegerechtigd tot het vermogen") of such enterprise without being a shareholder (as defined

<<<

 in The

Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001); or

(ii) the holder of Notes is considered to perform activities with respect to the Notes that go beyond ordinary asset management (in Dutch: "normaal, actief vermogensbeheer") or derives benefits

<<<

 from the Notes that are taxable as benefits from other activities (in Dutch: "resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden").

If the above-mentioned conditions (i) and (ii) do not apply to the individual holder of Notes, such holder will be taxed annually

<<<

 on a deemed income of 4% of his or her net investment assets for the year at an income tax rate of 30%. The net investment assets for the year are the fair market value of the investment assets less the allowable liabilities on 1 January of

<<<

 the relevant calendar year. The Notes are included as investment assets. A tax free allowance may be available. Actual income, gains or losses in respect of the Notes are not subject to Netherlands income tax.

Non-residents of the Netherlands

<<<



A holder of Notes that is neither resident nor deemed to be resident of the Netherlands will not be subject to Netherlands taxes on income or capital gains in respect of any payment under the Notes or in respect of any gain or loss realised

<<<

 on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Notes, provided that:

(i)

such holder does not have an interest in an enterprise or deemed enterprise (as defined in The

Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 and The Netherlands Corporate Income Tax Act

<<<

 1969) which, in

whole or in part, is either effectively managed in the Netherlands or carried on through a permanent

establishment, a deemed permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands and

to which enterprise

<<<

 or part of an enterprise the Notes are attributable; and

(ii) in the event the holder is an individual, such holder does not carry out any activities in the Netherlands with respect to the Notes that go beyond ordinary asset management and

<<<

 does not derive benefits from the Notes that are taxable as benefits from other activities in the Netherlands.

Gift and inheritance taxes Residents of the Netherlands

Gift or inheritance taxes will arise in the Netherlands with respect to

<<<

 a transfer of the Notes by way of a gift by, or on the death of, a holder of such Notes who is resident or deemed resident of the Netherlands at the time of the gift or his or her death.
Non-residents of the Netherlands

No Netherlands gift

<<<

 or inheritance taxes will arise on the transfer of Notes by way of gift by, or on the death of, a holder of Notes who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, unless:

(i)

in the case of a gift of a Note by an individual

<<<

 who at the date of the gift was neither resident nor

deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, such individual dies within 180 days after the date of the gift,

while being resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands; or

(ii) the

<<<

 transfer is otherwise construed as a gift or inheritance made by, or on behalf of, a person who, at the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands.

111

For purposes of Netherlands gift and inheritance taxes

<<<

, amongst others, a person that holds the Netherlands nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if such person has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his or

<<<

 her death. Additionally, for purposes of Netherlands gift tax, amongst others, a person not holding the Netherlands nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if such person has been resident in the Netherlands at any time

<<<

 during the twelve months preceding the date of the gift. Applicable tax treaties may override deemed residency.

Value added tax (VAT)

No Netherlands VAT will be payable by the holders of the Notes on (i) any payment in consideration for the

<<<

 issue of the Notes or (ii) the payment of interest or principal by the Issuer under the Notes.

Other taxes and duties

No Netherlands registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty will be payable by the holders

<<<

 of the Notes in respect of in connection with (i) the issue of the Notes or (ii) the payment of interest or principal by the Issuer under the Notes.

The Republic of Finland
The following is a general description addressing only the Finnish

<<<

 withholding tax treatment of income arising from the Notes, Coupons and payments under the Guarantee. This summary is based on the laws and regulations in full force and effect in Finland as at the date of this Prospectus, which may be subject

<<<

 to change in the future, potentially with retroactive effect. Investors should be aware that the comments below are of a general nature and do not constitute legal or tax advice and should not be understood as such. The comments below relate

<<<

 only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and Coupons. Prospective investors are therefore advised to consult their own qualified advisors so as to determine, in the light of their individual situation

<<<

, the tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, redemption, sale or other disposition of the Notes and Coupons.

Non-resident Holders of Notes and Coupons

Payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantor to persons not resident

<<<

 in Finland for tax purposes and who do not engage in trade or business through a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in Finland may be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes

<<<

, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Republic of Finland or by any municipality or other political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

Resident Holders of

<<<

 Notes and Coupons

(a)

Corporates

Payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantor to corporates resident in Finland for tax purposes may be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes

<<<

, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Republic of Finland or by any municipality or other political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

(b) Individuals and

<<<

 Estates

Payments of interest or interest compensation (secondary market compensation, in Finnish "jälkimarkkinahyvitys") made to individuals or estates are generally subject to advance withholding of income tax according to the Prepayment

<<<

 Act (Ennakkoperintälaki 1118/1996, as amended). The withholding liability should primarily lie with any paying agent or other intermediary (such as a financial institution) effecting the payment to the holder of Notes or Coupons, if the paying

<<<

 agent or intermediary is resident in Finland for tax purposes or the payment is made through a Finnish permanent establishment of a non-resident paying agent or intermediary.

112

The Act on Withholding on Interest Income (Laki korkotulon

<<<

 lähdeverosta 1341/1990, as amended) should not be applicable to payments made under the Notes, Coupons or the Guarantee.
Transfer Taxation
A transfer of the Notes or Coupons is not subject to Finnish transfer taxation.
EU Savings Directive

<<<


Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the Savings Directive), Member States are required to provide to the tax or other relevant authorities of other Member States details of

<<<

 certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member

<<<

 State.
For a transitional period, Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at the rate of 35%, (the ending of such transitional period being

<<<

 dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and certain dependent or associated territories of certain Member States have adopted similar

<<<

 measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding).
On 24 March 2014, the Council of the EU adopted a Council Directive (the Amending Directive) which if adopted would amend and broaden the scope of the requirements described

<<<

 above. Member States have until 1 January 2016 to adopt the national legislation necessary to comply with this Amending Directive.
However, the European Commission has proposed the repeal of the Savings Directive with effect from 1 January

<<<

 2017 in the case of Austria and from 1 January 2016 in the case of all other Member States (subject to on-going requirements to fulfil administrative obligations such as the reporting and exchange of information relating to, and accounting

<<<

 for withholding taxes on, payments made before those dates). This is to prevent overlap between the Savings Directive and a new automatic exchange of information regime to be implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative

<<<

 Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU). The proposal also provides that, if it proceeds, Member States will not be required to apply the new requirements of the Amending Directive. Investors who are

<<<

 in doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisers.
The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT)
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the Commission's Proposal) for a Directive for a common

<<<

 FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the participating Member States).
The Commission's Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings

<<<

 in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under the Commission's Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally

<<<

, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in

<<<

 a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating

<<<

 Member State.
A joint statement issued in May 2014 by the participating Member States (excluding Slovenia) indicated an intention to implement the FTT progressively, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain derivatives. On 

<<<

27 January 2015, a further joint statement by ministers of participating Member States (excluding Greece) stated, amongst other things, that the FTT should be based on the principle of the widest possible base and low
113

rates. Both statements

<<<

 expressed a willingness to create the conditions necessary to implement the FTT on 1 January 2016. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and may be the subject of further legal challenge. It

<<<

 may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EEA member states may decide to participate and for certain of the participating Member States may decide to withdraw. Prospective holders

<<<

 of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

'D)
Merger
In the case of a transaction under common control, the carry-over accounting method is applied. This means that the transaction is stated at the carrying amount in the financial statements for the year, in line with the amount included

<<<

 in the financial statements of the merged company, as of the merger date. The comparative figures are not restated. The difference between cost and the carrying amounts of the acquired assets and liabilities is recognized in equity as share

<<<

 premium of EUR 300.941. On the 25th of September Citycon Holding S.A.R.L. 100% shareholder of Citycon Treasury B.V. has been downstream merged into the company. The sole shareholder after the merger is Citycon OYJ, Helsinki. The main activity

<<<

Principles for the translation of foreign currencies
The reporting currency in the financial statements of Citycon Treasury B.V. is the euro (EUR

<<<

), which is the company's functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance

<<<

 sheet date are translated to euro at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognized in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of

<<<

 historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to euro at foreign

<<<

 exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The following exchange rate has been applied as at 31 December 2014: EUR 1 = SEK 9.393 (31-12-2013: EUR 1 = SEK: 8.8591); EUR 1 = DKK 7.4453 (31-12-2013: N/A).
Financial instruments

<<<


Financial instruments include trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and other financing commitments, trade and other payables.
Financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value. If instruments are not carried

<<<

 at fair value through profit and loss, then any directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement.
All financial instruments in the company are unsecured.
Amortized cost
Amortized cost is the amount at which a

<<<

 financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition less repayments of the principal, plus or less the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method for any difference between this initial amount and the maturity amount

<<<

, and less any reductions (effected directly or through a provision being formed) for impairment and doubtful debts.
Derivatives and hedge accounting
The company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to hedge

<<<

 its risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Forward exchange contracts are measured at fair value with recognition of all changes in value in the profit and loss account, except where hedge accounting is used to hedge the variability

<<<

 of future cash flows affecting the profit and loss account. The company does not apply hedge accounting for the fiscal years 2014 and 2013.

17. Risk management
General
During the normal course of business, Citycon Treasury B.V. makes use of several financial instruments such as bonds, notes, loans from and to affiliated companies and cash balances with banks. Due

<<<

 to the use of these financial instruments, the company is exposed to interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments (forward exchange contracts) to hedge its exposure to currency risks

<<<

 arising from financing activities, in accordance with its treasury policy.
Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates will affect the Company's financial position and cash flows

<<<

.
The Company has loans receivable from related parties and loans payable to the shareholder. The currency risk for the Company largely concerns SEK and DKK loan receivables from related parties. On the basis of a risk analysis, the Management

<<<

 of the Company has determined that the currency risk is being hedged with foreign exchange contracts as a result of the non-effective back to back loan situation with the shareholder.
Interest risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that fluctuations

<<<

 in the prevailing levels of market interest rates will affect the Company's financial position of cash flows. The Company effectively has no interest rate risk as the profit for the year before taxation is determined by applying a fixed margin

<<<

 to the average loans receivable outstanding during the year. Company's policy is to avoid interest risks by creating back to back structures, inserting equal interest base rates and determine same interest periods between assets and liabilities

<<<

.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of the Company failing to meet its contractual obligations due to insufficient liquidity. The Company's approach for funding and liquidity is to be managed centrally by the Group Treasury, which is

<<<

 responsible for ensuring adequate financial resources in place. Liquidity risk for the company is covered by the revolving credit facility and the back to back structure of interest settlement dates and maturity dates of its whole loan portfolio

<<<

.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. The Company's credit risk is predominantly emerging from loans payable and receivable with related parties and group companies. The emerging

<<<

 credit risk is mitigated by close monitoring of the financial performance of borrowing companies.
All financial instruments are concluded with either highly rated financial institutions or companies within the Citycon Group, which are expected

<<<

 to fully perform under the terms of the agreements. The company continuously monitors changes in credit ratings of counterparties. At the balance sheet date the credit risk concentrates on entities of the Citycon Group. The corporate credit

<<<

 rating of Citycon OYJ at issue date of these financial statements is for Standard & Poor's BBB with stable outlook and for Moody's Baa2 also with stable outlook. The company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations

<<<

. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.

SEKTOR GRUPPEN AS

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

Note 1 Accounting principles
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and generally accepted

<<<

 accounting principles in Norway.
Consolidation principles The Group's consolidated financial statements comprise the Parent Company Sektor Gruppen AS and subsidiaries in which the Parent Company directly or indirectly has a controlling interest

<<<

. A controlling interest is normally obtained when the Group owns more than 50% of the shares in the company and can exercise control over the company. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared at uniform principles, i.e., the

<<<

 subsidiaries apply the same accounting principles as the Parent Company. Transactions, receivables and payables within the Group are eliminated. The purchase method is applied when accounting for business combinations. Companies acquired or

<<<

 sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date when control is achieved and until control ceases. The cost of shares in subdsidiaries is eliminated against the subsidiaries' equity when the group is

<<<

 established. The cost of shares in excess of recorded equity is analysed and allocated to the items in the balance sheet to which the excess values relate within the market value of these assets. The excess values are written off over the remaining

<<<

 lifetime of the assets. Any excess value that cannot be allocated to specific assets, represents goodwill. Goodwill is written off over the assumed economic life on a straight-line basis.
Subsidiaries/associated companies/joint ventures Subsidiaries

<<<

 are valued at cost in the Parent Company accounts. Group contribution and dividend not exceeding profits in the owner period is recognised under finance items. Assets in the balance sheet are classified as financial non-current assets. Group

<<<

 contribution and dividend exceeding profits during the owner period is recognised is netted against financial non-current assets. Group contribution between subsidiaries is not recognised in the Parent Caccounts.
Investments in associated companies

<<<

, where the Group owns between 20% and 50%, and where the Group has significant influence and the investment is considered to be long-term, are accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated financial statements. In the company accounts

<<<

, the share of the result from associated companies is based on the invested companies' result after tax less internal gain and any depreciation of excess values when the cost price of the shares was higher than the acquired share of recorded

<<<

 equity. In the income statement, the share of the result is recognised under finance items. The assets in the balance sheet are classified as financial noncurrent assets.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for in accordance with the

<<<

 equity method in the consolidated financial statements. In the company accounts, the share of the profits from joint ventures is based on the invested companies' result after tax less internal gain and any depreciation of excess value when

<<<

 the cost of the shares was higher than the acquired share of recorded equity. In the income statement, the share of the result is recognised under finance items, and the assets in the balance sheet are classified as financial noncurrent assets

<<<

.
Revenue recognition Rental income is recognised when earned. Rental income comprises a fixed minimum rent and a part based on turnover. The part based on turnover is recognised on the basis of the tenants' reported turnover. The settlement

<<<

 of the rent based on turnover is made in the following period based on the actual turnover confirmed by the auditor. The recognition of fees is made as they are earned. Fees comprise fixed agreements for managing and administrating shopping

<<<

 centers, both the Group's own, hired and administered for exernal contractors. In addition, the Group undertakes assignments for the commercial development of projects. The recognition of the sale of residential housing is made at the date

<<<

 of the transfer of the house. Income and gain from the sale of shares and non-current assets is recognised at a time when most of the control and risk has been transferred to the buyer.
Classification and evaluation of the balance sheet items

<<<

 Current assets and current liabilities consist of items due for payment within one year and items related to the inventory cycle. Other items are classified as non-current assets/non-current liabilities. Current assets are valued at the lower

<<<

 of cost and fair value. Current liabilities are carried at their nominal amounts when incurred. Non-current assets are valued at cost, but are written down to fair value if the impairment is not considered to be temporary. Non-current liabilities

<<<

 are stated at nominal value when incurred. The first year's instalment is included in non-current liabilities.
Property, plant and equipment Property, pland and equipment is capitalised and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated

<<<

 useful life if this is more than 3 years, and the cost exceeds NOK 15 000. Direct maintenance of the assets is recorded as operating expenses as incurred, whereas costs for improvements and upgrading are added to the cost price of the asset

<<<

 and depreciated in line with the asset. The Group's properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis at 1% for shopping centers, parking lots and all fixed installations connected with them. The Group's properties are depreciated on a straight

<<<

-line basis at 2% for office premises. Lessee adjustments are capitalised and accrued over the contract period. Building loan interest is capitalised together with the buildling under construction. Projects in progress are not depreciated before

<<<

 they generate income.
An impairment loss of property, plant and equipment is recognised when the decline in value is not considered to be temporary. The asset is written down to its fair value, i.e., the recoverable amount. Reversals of write

<<<

-downs are made when the fair value of the tangible assets is higher than book value, and this is due to circumstances that were the original reason for the write-downs.
Projects in progress, in-house production Projects under construction in

<<<

 the Group are in-house projects valued at the lower of the acquisition cost and fair value. The acquisition cost comprises contract costs and other direct manufacturing costs. Fair value is the assumed sales price less sales costs.

SEKTOR GRUPPEN AS

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

Receivables Trade receivables and other receivables are carried at their nominal value less any provision for expected losses. The provision is made on the basis of individual assessments of each receivable

<<<

. In addition, a general provision for expected losses is made for the remaining receivables. Receivables due later than one year after the end of the accounting year are included in non-current receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and

<<<

 cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits, together with short-term liquid investments that can be immediately converted to cash and have a maximum term to maturity of three months.
Equity transactions Expenses related to equity

<<<

 transactions are recognised directly in equity after tax.
Pensions The Group is obliged to provide an occupational pension pursuant to the Act on Mandatory Occupational Pension, and the Group's pension scheme complies with the requirements

<<<

 of this act. The Group only has contribution based pension plans, and future pension yields are mainly based on the number of years of earnings, salary levels and the current return on the contribution portfolio.
Income tax Income tax in the

<<<

 income statement comprises tax payable for the period and the change in deferred tax. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets on acquisitions are assessed at present value, which is reflected in the transaction price. For depreciable properties

<<<

, an effective tax rate of 7% has been applied. For land, deferred tax is calculated at 0%. Deferred tax on the properties is reversed in line with the lifetime of the properties. For other temporary differences between book and tax values and

<<<

 tax losses to carry forward, a tax rate of 27% has been applied. Tax increasing and tax reducing temporary differences that reverse or can reverse in the same period are netted. Deferred tax assets are recognised in the balance sheet to the

<<<

 extent that future use can be made probable. There is no time limit for the opportunity to carry forward losses.
Use of estimates As required by generally accepted accounting principles in Norway, management has used estimates and assumptions

<<<

 affecting the income statement and the valuation of assets and liabilities, in addition to uncertain assets and obligations at the balance sheet date, in the preparation of the financial statements.
Group account scheme The Company and the

<<<

 Group participate in an agreement of a group account scheme, where the Parent Company is the owner of the agreement with the credit institution. Net funds/drawings concerning the account are recognised as a bank deposit/liability to the credit

<<<

 institution in the Parent Company accounts, whereas positions related to the individual subsidiary are classified as an intercompany balance.
Interest expenses Interest on fixed loan agreements is expensed as incurred. Any premiums/discounts

<<<

 are not recognised in the income statement.
Hedging The Group applies interest options to hedge interest rate risk. At cash-flow hedging, realised and unrealised gain, loss and premium on the hedge instrument is recognised in line with the

<<<

 underlying hedged object's impact on the income statement.
Statement of cash flows In the preparation of the statement of cash flows the indirect model is applied. The cash flows are reported gross for investing and financing activities, whereas

<<<

 the accounting result is reconciled against net cash flows from operating activities. At the acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries, the balance sheet changes resulting from the purchase or sale are accounted for in the same manner as other

<<<

 changes in the balance sheet.

Note 26 Financial market risk
The Group's financial market risk is mainly related

 to fluctuations in the Norwegian interest level. In order to reduce the interest rate risk, the Group applies various types of interest hedging instruments. At 31 December 2014, 51% of the Group's long-term interest-bearing debt had a fixed

<<<

 interest rate with a weighted remaining maturity of appr. 3,1 years. 49% of the loan portfolio are subject to an interest rate regulation in the course of the next 12 months. A change in the general interest rate level of 1 percentage point

<<<

 would imply a chnage in the Group's interest costs of appr. MNOK 37,8.
The Group is not exposed to curency exchange risk.
There is credit risk related to rental agreements, but this risk is considered to be moderate. The rental contracts are

<<<

 basically secured by 6 months of bank guarantees/deposits, the contract mass is widely spread, and the largest lessees are assessed to be solid.
The Group's liquidity risk is balanced through long-term loan agreements and liquidity reserves

<<<

 in bank deposits and committed drawing rights in banks/credit institutions.
