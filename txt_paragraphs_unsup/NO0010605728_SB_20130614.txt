(d) As a result of the non-compliance of the undertakings under Clause 1

<<<

3.5(c) {Minimum Equity) of the Bond Agreement and Clause 8.1(b) of the SEK Bond Agreement, respectively, the events of default set out in Clauses 15.1(b) {Breach o f other obligations) and 15.1(c) {Cross default) of the Bond Agreement will be

<<<

 triggered.

(e) In connection with the events specified in sections (a) to (d) above, the Issuer is currently contemplating to (i) raise approximately SEK 891,000,000 by way of a fully underwritten rights issue with preferential rights for

<<<

 existing shareholders of the Issuer with a subscription undertaking from some of the largest shareholders of the Issuer holding an aggregate of 17 per cent of the shares in the Issuer (the "Rights Issue"); and (ii) refinance the amount outstanding

 than 50 per cent of the proposed bond financing amount, subject to terms and conditions being similar to the terms and conditions of the existing SEK Bond Agreement with the modification to the minimum equity ratio as requested below (the

(f) As a result of the Rights Issue and the Bond Issue, the Issuer will be able to repay the amount outstanding under the SEK Bond Agreement on its maturity date and be well positioned for any future refinancing as well as for

<<<



(the "Requested Waiver and Amendment").
