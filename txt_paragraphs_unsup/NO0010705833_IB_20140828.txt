QUARTERLY REPORT - June 30, 2014
Westport, Connecticut, August 27, 2014
Summary
The quarter ended June 30, 2014, was a transformative period for Ridgebury Crude Tankers LLC ("Ridgebury

<<<

" or the "Company"). The Company moved to implement the business plan outlined in connection with the March 20, 2014 placement of $210 million Senior Secured Bonds, taking delivery of five additional Suezmax tankers to grow its total owned fleet

<<<

 to seven. Highlights included:
 Delivery and operational takeover of five vessels between April 8 and April 24  Successful vetting inspections for all newly acquired vessels, and subsequent entry to Blue Fin
Pool (or time charter) between

<<<

 April 8 and May 27  Successful dry docking of Ridgebury John Zipser for scheduled first special survey in Jurong
shipyard, Malaysia  Revenue of $6.7 million, EBITDA of $1.1 million and net loss of $6.0 million
Ridgebury finished the quarter

<<<

 with its fleet fully deployed, including six of the seven vessels operating in the spot market in time to participate in a counter-seasonal freight rate recovery. For the six vessels in the spot market, the third quarter is currently 76% booked

<<<

 at average rates of about $24,500 per day.
Suezmax Freight Market
The spot market during the second quarter weakened considerably versus the first quarter. Ridgebury Lessley B, the only Ridgebury-controlled vessel operating continuously in

<<<

 the Blue Fin pool since the beginning of the year, earned approximately $34,400 per day (net of all pool fees and commissions) during the first quarter, but with second quarter distributions closer to $14,700, its average for the entire six

<<<

 month period stood at approximately $24,500 per day.
The freight environment strengthened considerably beginning in June and continued this upward momentum through July and early August. The atypical summer strength was driven by several factors

<<<

 including a high loading schedule from Iraq due to a worsening security outlook, significant West-East movements (generating higher tonne-mile demand) as well as the emergence of Brent crude oil pricing contango (in which the "prompt" oil price

<<<

 is less than the price of oil for future delivery, which encourages traders to book later delivery dates and use tankers as floating storage.)
Rates have softened during August, a trend that Ridgebury expects to continue for the remainder of

<<<

 the third quarter, as refineries begin the process of switching from the summer driving season to the winter heating season, which leads to reduced refinery runs. Still, it is expected that the third quarter will deliver the highest rates for

<<<

 that period since 2008, and management believes that the unexpected summer strength is evidence of market tightness, and may signal better trading conditions ahead.

Suezmax Asset Market Activity in the sale and purchase market continued to

<<<

 be extremely light, with a large "bid/ask" spread between buyer offers and seller expectations. In general, increasing confidence in the sector outlook continued to support the ongoing recovery in vessel values. Two 2005-built Hyundai vessels

<<<

 were reported sold at $36.5mm each in early June, up somewhat from $35mm for similar vessels sold in February. In August, a 2013 Samsung vessel was reported sold at $65 million, compared to the $51 million paid by Ridgebury for a comparable

<<<

 vessel in September 2013. Two Suezmax vessels were delivered and two were scrapped in the second quarter, in line with expectations. New firm orders were placed for six ships, all with Korean yards, with reported contract prices in the range

<<<

 of $68 million from top tier yards, and approximately $65 million at secondary yards.

Ridgebury Crude Tankers - Financial Performance
Summary
The second quarter saw Ridgebury take delivery of five vessels, using

<<<

 proceeds from the $210 million bond that settled March 20th and bringing the fleet to seven. The delivery timing meant that the fleet had approximately 458 ship-revenue-days in the pool or on time charter, versus a fully deployed figure of

<<<

 644 days (i.e., the number of days had all vessels been delivered and employed from April 1). As shown in the chart below, five of the seven vessels were fully deployed as of May, and all seven were fully deployed in June.

Currently, six vessels are trading in the Heidmar Blue Fin pool, with the seventh

<<<

 operating under a time charter contract through November 2014.
Results from Operations
Second quarter revenue of $6.7 million reflected less than a full quarter of revenue, as only one vessel was fully employed for the entire period. The Ridgebury

<<<

 John Zipser underwent a scheduled dry dock in April, resulting in approximately 23 off-hire days, while the five newly-acquired vessels entered their pool or time charter arrangements during April and May. For the period since inception, revenue

<<<

 of $7.3 million reflects the results of the second quarter, plus approximately 11 days revenue for two vessels in the first quarter. No further drydocks are scheduled for the remainder of 2014.
Voyage costs were incurred for a single voyage

<<<

 performed by Ridgebury Mary Selena prior to her entry to Blue Fin Pool, which was necessary to carry out vetting inspections to gain the necessary approvals from oil majors so that the vessel could enter the pool.

Operating expenses for the

<<<

 vessels were in line with budget at less than $7,000 per day, excluding one time takeover expenses. The ships had approximately 545 operating expense days for the quarter, higher than the 458 revenue days, reflecting the time between taking

<<<

 delivery of certain vessels and positioning them for pool entry, as well as drydock-related offhire on one vessel.
EBITDA was approximately $1.1 million for the quarter, with a net loss after depreciation, amortization and bond interest of

<<<

 $6.0 million.
Balance Sheet Items
The Company had no financial debt except the $210 million Senior Secured Bond placed March 20, 2014. As of June 30, Ridgebury had $12.8 million of cash, and Current Assets of $23.8 million compared to Current

<<<

 Liabilities of $5.0 million. Management considers that the Company has sufficient liquidity from operations, reserves and additional shareholders funds to meet its obligations as they come due.
Outlook
With 76% of the third quarter booked at

<<<

 approximately $24,500 per day, and all vessels expected to have a full quarter of earnings, Ridgebury anticipates reporting stronger results for the third and fourth quarters, though management expects some weakness in the September to November

<<<

 period.
