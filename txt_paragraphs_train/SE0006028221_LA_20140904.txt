(d) or, regarding any of the Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Clauses 15.1 (e), (f),

(g), (h) and (j) may only occur if the nature

<<<

 of the particular circumstance is such that it

would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the

time of the Agent's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that

moratorium will

<<<

 not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned

in Clause 15.1 (e).

15.3

If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government

authority, it is not necessary that the decision

<<<

 has become enforceable under law or that the

period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.

15.4

The Issuer is obligated to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in

<<<

 Clause 15.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur,

29

15.5 15.6
15.7 15.8 15.9 15.10

provided that the Agent does not have

<<<

 knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in Clause 15.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent, provide the Agent with details of any

<<<

 circumstances referred to in Clause 15.1 and provide the Agent with all documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 15.
The Issuer is only obligated to inform the Agent according to Clause 15.4 if informing the

<<<

 Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the relevant Regulated

<<<

 Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obligated to either seek the approval from the relevant Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to

<<<

 be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 15.4.
If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a default under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 15.1, the Agent shall decide

<<<

, within twenty (20) Business Days of the day of notification or determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the Agent has decided not to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders

<<<

 that there exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the provisions in Clause 17 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the

<<<

 Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest

<<<

 possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default and whether such event has a Material

<<<

 Adverse Effect.
If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 17 (Decisions by Holders), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds

<<<

 terminated. The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability and

<<<

, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 15, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary

<<<

 to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 15 without relevant decision by the Agent or following instructions

<<<

 from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 17 (Decisions by Holders).
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 15, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to 105.00 per
30

<<<

&&&

cent. of the Nominal Amount or, if the Bonds are declared due and payable on or after the First Call Date, at the applicable Call Option Amount.

16.

<<<

 principal under the Bonds; and

(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.

Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a

<<<

) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue

<<<

 or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.

16.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 16.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement

<<<

 by way of a

corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 16.1.

16.3

If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 16, the Issuer or the

Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Holders of any such payment at

but unpaid the Record Date specified

<<<

 in Clause 9.1 shall apply.

<<<

 (in accordance with Clause 19.1), as the case may be, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Person(s) who initiated the procedure for Holders' consent. The quorum requirement in Clause 17.8 shall not apply to such
