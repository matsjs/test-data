5.3

The Agent will hold the security created under the Security Documents

with the Issuer, the Subsidiaries, or third parties if it is, in the Agent's sole

<<<

 discretion,

necessary for the purpose of establishing, maintaining, altering, releasing or enforcing the

security created (or to be created) under the Security Documents or for the purpose of

settling the various Holders' relative rights

<<<

 to the security created under the Security

Documents, respectively. The Agent is entitled to take all measures available to it according

created under the Security Documents, in such manner and under such conditions that the

Agent finds acceptable (if in accordance with the

<<<

 Security Documents, respectively).

5.6

If a Holders' Meeting has been convened, or a Written Procedure instigated, to decide on the

termination of the Bonds and/or the enforcement of all or any of the security created under

all or any of

<<<

 the Security Documents, the Agent is obligated to take actions in accordance

with the Holders' decision regarding the security created under the Security Documents.

However, if the Bonds are not terminated due to that the cause for termination

<<<

 has ceased or

due to any other circumstance mentioned in these Terms and Conditions, the Agent shall not

enforce any of the security created under the Security Documents. If the Holders, without

any prior initiative from the Agent or the

<<<

 Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination

of the Bonds and enforcement of any of the security created under the Security Documents

in accordance with the procedures set out in Clauses 17 (Decisions by Holders), 18

(Holder's Meeting

<<<

) and 19 (Written procedures), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds

terminated and enforce the security created under the Security Documents. The Agent is

however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination

obligation.

redovisningsmedel

<<<

) and must be held on a separate account on behalf of the Holders. The

Agent shall promptly arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with Clause 16

14

(Distribution o fproceeds). If the Agent deems it appropriate, it may, in accordance

<<<

 with Clause 5.8, instruct the CSD to arrange for payment to the Holders.

5.8

For the purpose of exercising the rights of the Holders and the Agent under these Terms and

Conditions and for the purpose of distributing any funds originating

<<<

 from the enforcement of

any security created under the Security Documents, the Issuer irrevocably authorises and

empowers the Agent to act in the name of the Issuer, and on behalf of the Issuer, to instruct

the CSD to arrange for payment

<<<

 to the Holders in accordance with Clause 5.7. To the extent

permissible by law, the powers set out in this Clause 5.8 are irrevocable and shall be valid

for as long as any Bonds remain outstanding. The Issuer shall immediately upon request

<<<

 by

the Agent provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney

(in form and substance to the Agent's satisfaction), which the Agent deems necessary for the

purpose of carrying out its duties under Clause 5

<<<

.7 (including as required by the CSD in

order for the CSD to accept such payment instructions). Especially, the Issuer shall, upon the

Agent's request, provide the Agent with a written power of attorney empowering the Agent

to change the

<<<

specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, in accordance

15.4

The Issuer is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

pursuant to the listing contract with Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as

applicable) or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the approval

<<<

 the Agent has decided not to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that there exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the provisions in Clause 17

<<<

 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal

<<<

 has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take

<<<

 the time necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.
If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause

<<<

 to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions

<<<

 in this Clause 15, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.

(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and

(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro

<<<

 rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.

Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in

<<<

 accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal

<<<

.

16.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 16.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a

corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause

<<<

<<<

 disclose the identity of any other Holder who has consented to the Agent in doing so.

 loss.

<<<

 or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.
