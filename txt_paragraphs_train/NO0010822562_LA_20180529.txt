SCHEDULE 8 JUNIOR INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT PRINCIPLES

SCHEDULE 8
PRINCIPLES FOR THE JUNIOR INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT
This

<<<

 outline sets out core principles that will govern the intercreditor agreement between the streaming purchasers (the "Purchasers") and the lenders under any senior secured financing arrangement (collectively or through their appointed agent

<<<

/trustee, the "Lenders"). This outline is not intended to be exhaustive in nature, with the form and substance of the intercreditor agreement to be otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Purchasers and the Lenders, acting reasonably

<<<

. In this outline, the streaming agreement between the Purchasers and Nemaska Lithium Shawinigan Transformation Inc. (the "Seller") is referred to as the "Stream Agreement" and each senior secured bond indenture, loan agreement or other debt

<<<

 instrument between the borrower (the "Borrower") and any of the Lenders are collectively referred to as the "Loan Agreement". The "Project" is the Whabouchi spodumene mine in the Province of Quebec (the "Mine") and related processing facilities

<<<

, including the hydrometallurgical plant in the City of Shawinigan.
1. Consent. The Purchasers and the Lenders consent to each other's security and confirm that the security granted in favour of the other is not prohibited by the agreements

<<<

 and other documentation governing their respective relationship with the Seller, the Borrower, and Nemaska Lithium Inc. ("Parent") and its subsidiaries holding a direct or indirect interest in the Project (such subsidiary entities, together

<<<

 with the Seller and the Borrower, the "Project Entities"). The Purchasers and the Lenders also agree not to contest the security in favour of the other so long as it is consistent with the principles hereunder.
2. Security. The scope of collateral

<<<

 to be charged by the security granted by Parent and the Project Entities securing the Stream Agreement (the "Stream Security") in support of the obligations of the Seller under the Stream Agreement (the "Stream Obligations") will not be identical

<<<

 to the scope of collateral to be charged by the security (the "Loan Security") in support of the loan obligations owing to the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Agreement, including without limitation all interest, default interest, premiums, costs

<<<

, indemnities and other outstanding amounts thereunder (the "Loan Obligations"). It is intended that where there is an overlap of collateral the documentation in respect of the Stream Security will be substantially identical to the documentation

<<<

 in respect of the Loan Security, but that the security package will not be held in common by the agent/trustee holding the Loan Security.
3. Ranking. The Loan Security and Loan Obligations shall be senior in all respects and prior to the Stream

<<<

 Security and Stream Obligations (whether or not the Loan Security is subordinated to any security interests and hypothec securing any other obligations of Parent or the Project Entities) and the Stream Security and Stream Obligations shall

<<<

 be junior and subordinate in all respects to the Loan Security and Loan Obligations. The Purchasers shall not be entitled to any proceeds of realization of any collateral secured by either the Stream Security or the Loan Security or any distributions

<<<

 or payments under any Insolvency Plan (as defined below) or any similar proceeding or arrangement unless and until the Loan Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full, and the Purchasers shall hold any such proceeds or distributions received

<<<

 in trust for the Lenders and forthwith pay such funds to the Lenders.
4. Stream Deliveries: Repayment of Deposit. The Lenders will acknowledge that all obligations of the Project Entities to the Purchasers with respect to net credits or in

<<<

 kind deliveries of spodumene concentrate and refined lithium products pursuant to the Stream Agreement (the "Stream Products") reflect a pre-paid forward purchase obligation of the Project Entities. In all cases, the Purchasers will be entitled

<<<

, pursuant to the terms of the Stream Agreement, to (a) the Stream Products to be delivered to the Purchasers pursuant to the Stream Agreement and, unless the Purchasers have taken physical delivery of such Stream Products, all proceeds thereof

<<<

, and (b)the amount of all Stream Products which, pursuant to the terms of the Stream Agreement, should have

been delivered to or for the benefit of the Purchasers but which was not delivered or which was used for another purpose in contravention

<<<

 of the Stream Agreement, and all proceeds thereof. Deliveries of Stream Products under the Stream Agreement shall not be subject to stoppage at any time by the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Agreement and other loan documentation (the "Loan Documentation

<<<

"). While any amounts remaining owing to the Lenders, no deposit paid by the Purchasers pursuant to the Stream Agreement may be returned or repaid to the Purchasers other than by way of depletions of the uncredited balance as partial payment

<<<

 for deliveries of Stream Products and the reduction in the uncredited balance resulting from the exercise by Seller of its buy down rights under the Stream Agreement. For so long as any amounts are outstanding under the Loan Agreement, the

<<<

 Purchasers will not take any action that results in receipt by the Purchasers prior to the repayment in full of all amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement of any accelerated repayment of the deposit or any default or damages amounts under

<<<

 the Stream Agreement beyond (i) insurance proceeds referenced in Section 14 below, and (ii) amounts in respect of what was scheduled to be received (but was not received) in the ordinary course pursuant to the Stream Agreement in accordance

<<<

 with the last sentence of Section 5 below.
Enforcement. The Lenders shall (in accordance with the provisions to such effect in the Loan Documentation) have the exclusive entitlement to exercise rights and remedies in respect of the collateral

<<<

 or take or commence any enforcement or insolvency action following the occurrence of an event of default (an "Enforcement Action") and during a Standstill Period (defined below). A standstill period (the "Standstill Period") will apply to the

<<<

 Purchasers and automatically begin upon the existence of an event of default under the Stream Agreement, and may otherwise be initiated by the Lenders at any time following the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement by giving

<<<

 written notice of same to the Purchasers, and shall end on the date which is 180 days after the earlier of (a) the date on which the Purchasers declared the existence of an event of default under the Stream Agreement and provided notice of

<<<

 same to the Lenders (or their collateral agent), and (b) the date on which the Lenders (or their collateral agent) provided the Purchasers with written notice of the Standstill Period, or such longer period during which the Lenders are diligently

<<<

 pursuing the exercise of their rights and remedies by means of an Enforcement Action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers may, at any time, including during a Standstill Period, (i) file a proof of claim in any insolvency proceeding

<<<

, (ii) file responsive or defensive pleadings to any objections to the Purchasers' claim in connection with an insolvency proceeding, (iii) issue a notice of default to Parent or a Project Entity, (iv) issue any statutory notices required in

<<<

 connection with the Stream Security at any time after such statutory notices have been issued by the Lenders (or any receiver appointed by it) in connection with the Loan Security, (v) issue any demand for payment of Parent's or a Project Entity

<<<

's obligations to the Purchasers, (vi) terminate the Stream Agreement and trigger liquidated damages thereunder after the earlier of (x) the Lenders have accelerated such the obligations under the Loan Documentation or otherwise taken any Enforcement

<<<

 Action, (y) the end of the Standstill Period, or (z) the Parent or any Project Entity voluntarily commenced, or having been petitioned into, any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, or (vii) vote a claim after the occurrence of an insolvency

<<<

 event in a manner consistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (viii) take any action required to preserve the validity, efficacy or subordinated position of the Stream Agreement or the Stream Security, including the commencement

<<<

 or initiation of any action required to comply with statutory limitation periods, provided that in each case the Purchasers shall take no further steps, actions or proceedings in furtherance of such actions and no such actions shall impede

<<<

 upon the Lenders' ability to take or continue any Enforcement Action. For greater certainty, the Purchasers may also in all cases seek remedies intended to ensure performance by the Project Entities of their Stream Products delivery obligations

<<<

 under the Stream Agreement or to segregate and maintain the identifiability of the Stream Products to be delivered thereunder or to trace any Stream Products the Project Entities failed to deliver on account of the Stream Obligations, provided

<<<

 that such actions or remedies do not impede upon the Lenders' ability to take or continue any Enforcement Action.

6

Enforcement Action. If the Purchasers have not terminated the Stream Agreement: (a) to the extent

that the Lenders foreclose

<<<

 on all or any material part of the Project assets for the purpose of

continuing to mine or extract Stream Products from the Mine (or for the purpose of ultimately,

directly or indirectly, selling, transferring or disposing of such material

<<<

 part of the Project assets to

another person whose intention is to do so), the Lenders shall be bound by and subject to the terms

of the Stream Agreement and shall ensure that the sale, transfer or disposition of the collateral

complies

<<<

 with the transfer provisions under the Stream Agreement; (b) the Lenders undertake that

they will not request, approve, support consent to or vote in favour of (and shall be deemed to have

voted to reject) any plan, arrangement, liquidation

<<<

, reorganization, proposal, compromise or similar

arrangement (an "Insolvency Plan") pursuant to or relating to any proceeding arising from an

insolvency event with respect to Parent or a Project Entity that involves (i) a sale, disposition

<<<

 or

transfer of all or any material part of the Project assets to a transferee, unless such Insolvency Plan

requires that any such transferee agrees in writing in favour of the Purchasers to be bound by and

subject to the terms of the Stream

<<<

 Agreement (or amended or replacement agreement which

preserves the economic benefits and position of the Purchasers under the Stream Agreement,

including re-granting of the Stream Security (a "Replacement Agreement")), to the extent that

<<<

 it

takes possession of all or any material part of the Project assets and continues and plans to continue

to mine or extract Stream Products from the Mine, or (ii) a restructuring or rearrangement of some

or all of the obligations of Parent

<<<

 or a Project Entity (including a sale, disposition or other transfer of

the shares of the Seller) where all or any material part of the Project assets continue to be the

property of Parent or a Project Entity (including the Seller) and the

<<<

 Project continues to mine or

extract Stream Products from the Mine, unless such arrangement preserves the material rights of

the Purchasers under the Stream Agreement or a Replacement Agreement, including by way of the

survival of the Stream

<<<

 Agreement; and (c) the Lenders undertake that they will use their rights as a

creditor to create, support and vote in favour of any Insolvency Plan that meets (or exceeds from the

perspective of the Purchasers, acting reasonably) the conditions

<<<

 set out in clause (b) above, and will

not request, approve or consent to or encourage or support any other person in approving (or vote

in favour of or support any application, restructuring, refinancing, recapitalization, plan, proposal

<<<

 or

other transaction which involves) the Stream Agreement not continuing as an ongoing obligation of

Seller; provided that nothing herein shall (I) require the Lenders to support or vote in favour of any

Insolvency Plan which (y) does not

<<<

 indefeasibly repay, in full in immediately available funds, the Loan

Obligations or (z) compromises the Loan Obligations (including extending the time for payment of

the Loan Obligations or amending the terms of the Loan Documents) or the

<<<

 rights of the Lenders, in

any way, unless otherwise supported by the Lenders in their sole discretion or (II) prevent the

Lenders from pursuing or supporting a liquidation of the Project assets, including through

Enforcement Action, which

<<<

 does not result in any person continuing to mine or extract Stream

Products from the Mine to the extent that the Lenders reasonably view such liquidation (x) as

necessary to ensure repayment in full of the Loan Obligations or (y) reasonably

<<<

 likely to result in

materially superior recovery of proceeds versus other Enforcement Actions.

7. Purchasers Voting. While any amounts remaining owing to the Lenders, the Purchasers undertake that they (i) will not request, approve, support

<<<

, consent to or vote in favour of (and shall be deemed to have voted to reject) any Insolvency Plan or any sale, disposition or distribution of the Seller's or the Borrower's assets which (a) does not indefeasibly repay, in full in immediately

<<<

 available funds, the Loan Obligations or (b) compromises the Loan Obligations (including extending the time for payment of the Loan Obligations or amending the terms of the Loan Documents) or the rights of the Lenders, in any way, unless otherwise

<<<

 supported by the Lenders, (ii) will use their rights as a creditor to create, support and vote in favour of any Insolvency Plan that meets (or exceeds from the perspective of the Lenders, acting reasonably) the conditions set out in clause

<<<

 (i) above, and will not request, approve or consent to or encourage or support any other person in approving (or vote in favour of or support any application, restructuring, refinancing, recapitalization, plan, proposal or other transaction

<<<

 which involves) anything contrary to clause (ii) above; and (iii) will not vote or take

any position contrary to the position of the Lenders with any receiver or with the Court, provided in each case that the Lenders and/or such Insolvency

<<<

 Plan are in compliance with Section 6 above.

8. Purchase Right. Following notice by the Lenders of any intention to take an Enforcement Action, the Purchasers shall have the right to purchase the obligations under the Loan Agreement for an

<<<

 amount equal to the Loan Obligations outstanding at the time of the purchase (including, for greater certainty, all interest, costs and penalties). The Purchasers' election to purchase the Loan Obligations shall be exercised in writing and

<<<

 shall be completed (with payment of the purchase price) within ten (10) business days following such election being delivered, upon terms to be agreed upon and attached as a schedule to the Intercreditor Agreement. Unless and until the purchase

<<<

 right is completed, the granting of the purchase right and the delivery of an election to exercise the purchase right shall not in any way limit or restrict the Lenders rights under the Intercreditor Agreement, including the right to take or

<<<

 continue any Enforcement Action.

9.

New Liens. If the Purchasers shall acquire or hold any lien or hypothec on any assets of Parent or any

of its subsidiaries securing Stream Obligations which assets are not also subject to the lien or

<<<

 consent from any other party to the Senior Intercreditor Agreement).
The Senior Intercreditor Agreement shall be governed by Quebec law.
Subject to the limitations set out in clause 5 (Limits on Senior Secured Obligations) below, the obligations
