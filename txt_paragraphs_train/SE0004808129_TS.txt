Risk factors
All investments in bonds involve a degree o f risk. The financial performance o f the Company and the risks associated with its business are important when making a decision on whether to invest

<<<

 in the Bonds. A number o f risk factors and uncertainties may adversely affect the Company. I f any o f these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the business, operating results andfinancial condition o f the Company could be materially

<<<

 and adversely affected which ultimately could affect the Companys' ability to make interest payments and payments o f principal under the Terms and Conditions. In this Section, a number o f risk factors are illustrated, both general risks pertaining

<<<

 to the Company's business operations and material risks relating to the Bonds as financial instruments. The risks presented in this Prospectus are not exhaustive, and other risks not discussed herein may also adversely affect the Company. Further

<<<

, the risk factors are not ranked in order o f importance.
Prospective investors should consider carefully the information contained in this Prospectus and make an independent evaluation before making an investment decision. A potential investor

<<<

 must, alone or together with its financial and/or other advisors, consider the general business prospects, other information in this Prospectus and general information about the applicable market and companies active on that market, based on

<<<

 their personal circumstances before making an investment. An investor should possess sufficient knowledge to assess the riskfactors and sufficientfinancial strength to bear those risks.
RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY Technical and geological

<<<

 risk The main operational risk is that the interest the Group has in oil and gas assets will not evolve into commercial reserves of oil and gas. All assessments of potential oil and gas reserves are built on estimations and involve a certain

<<<

 degree of uncertainty. Every estimation of such reserves done by geologists is based on such factors as seismic data, loggings from existing drilled holes, extracted bore specimens, simulating models from computers, factual oil torrents and

<<<

 pressure data from existing holes, oil prices etcetera. Thus, oil and gas reserve estimates always change over time, to a larger or smaller extent. There is always a risk that the estimated volumes will not accord with reality. Estimates, presented

<<<

 in the Prospectus, are done based on data, which to date is available regarding respective projects and about expected oil prices. There are no guarantees that these estimates will not change over time as new data becomes available. The actual

<<<

 production and cash flow will therefore vary from the estimations and the variations may occasionally be large, which in turn could adversely affect the Company's financial position and results. Furthermore, probabilities that commercial oil

<<<

 reserves will not be found are highest before and during exploration drilling. Even when the presence of oil and gas reserves are established during exploration drilling, significant uncertainty remain as to when and how these reserves can

<<<

 be extracted. The estimated reserves will therefore be reduced to the extent these activities do not, fully or partially, reach the estimated levels.
General business risks The Group's business is exposed to all of the risks and uncertainties

<<<

 with which the business of exploration, acquisition, development, production and sale of oil and gas is associated. These risks cannot be entirely avoided, even with a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation. The risks and

<<<

 uncertainties normally associated with the oil and gas business include fire, explosions, blowouts (i.e. an
4

uncontrolled spillage of oil, gas or water from an oil well), sour gas emissions, burst pipelines and oil spills. Each of these

<<<

 risks may result in extensive damage to oil and gas wells, production facilities, other property or the environment, and may cause considerable personal injury. This may in turn result in extensive liability for damages and the like. Collection

<<<

 systems and processing facilities are also exposed to many of these risks. Each instance where there is significant damage to the systems and facilities on which the Group depends can have a negative impact on the Group's ability to sell the

<<<

 oil and gas it produces. The oil and gas business is also exposed to the risk of a premature decline in reserves for natural reasons or an inflow of water into producing formations. If any of the above risks and uncertainties should occur it

<<<

 may result in significantly increased costs and liabilities which in turn may adversely affect the Company's financial position and prospects.
Fluctuating production levels Exploration for and exploitation of oil and gas reserves may be delayed

<<<

 or negatively affected by factors beyond the Group's control. Such factors include unfavourable weather, climate or geological conditions, decisions taken or work carried out by partners or suppliers which the Group may be dependent upon now

<<<

 or in the future, accommodating governmental demands, problems or delays in installation and ordering of machinery and equipment, or delays in imports or customs clearance. Problems may also arise due to environmental problems, accidents, occupational

<<<

 and health risks, industrial disputes, locally acquired equipment being of poor quality or in poor working order, or disruptions in the supply of services and products such as electricity, water, fuel, transport, process capacity or technical

<<<

 support. This may result in failure to meet established production deadlines and/or lead to increased costs. Fluctuations that impact production at any of the Group's facilities may thus have a material impact on the Group's forecast production

<<<

 levels and therefore also on profit levels.
Oil price
The oil price is of significant importance to Tethys Oil as income and profitability is and will be dependent on prices prevailing from time to time, which are influenced by a considerable

<<<

 number of factors outside of the Company's control. Examples of such factors are market fluctuations, closeness to and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and decisions by public authorities. The prices of oil and natural gas have historically

<<<

 fluctuated considerably, and can be expected to continue to do so in the future. In whole, this entails that the possibility to forecast future oil and natural gas prices is limited. A significant, long-term decrease in the market prices of

<<<

 oil and natural gas could have a considerably negative effect on Tethys Oil's income and results. When oil and natural gas prices are decreasing, this may affect the financial conditions for oil production. A considerable price decrease might

<<<

 result in a reduction in worth of Tethys Oil's oil and natural gas reserves and it would no longer be profitable to carry out prospecting and production in certain locations. This may entail both considerably lower income and results, and downsizing

<<<

 of the Company's potential exploration and expansion projects. A considerable price decrease for oil and natural gas may also negatively affect Tethys Oil's ability to attract financing in the form of loans or issue of shares. Lower oil prices

<<<

 could also decrease the industry interest in Tethys Oil's projects regarding farmouts or sale of assets. Tethys Oil does not currently hedge oil prices.
5

Access to equipment An operational risk factor is access to equipment in Tethys Oil

<<<

's projects. Especially in the drilling/development phase of a project the group is dependent on advanced equipment such as rigs, casing, pipes etc. It cannot be excluded that there might be a shortage of drilling equipment and/or other necessary

<<<

 equipment, or that such equipment would require additional investments which might cause delays and increased costs for the prospecting and development activities.
Political risk Tethys Oil has operations, alone or with partners, in several

<<<

 different countries and can therefore be subject to political risk. Changes in legislation or other regulations related, for instance, to foreign ownership, state participation, taxes, allocation of licenses and concessions, royalties, environmental

<<<

 regulations, customs duties or exchange rates can affect the Company's operations or results. Tethys Oil holds its oil and gas interest through licences, directly or indirectly, which are granted by national governments. Tethys Oil's operations

<<<

 are often also subject to local permits. Therefore Tethys Oil and the industry are subject to a wide range of political risks on different levels and the business is highly sensitive to political changes. Furthermore, Company's financial position

<<<

 and earnings can be affected by internal conflicts, acts of war, terrorism and insurrection, as well as political and economical insecurity.
Environment Oil and gas operations can be environmentally sensitive. The Company's operations are subject

<<<

 to extensive regulatory control with regard to environmental matters, both on national and international levels. Environmental legislation regulates inter alia the control of water and air contamination, waste material, licensing requirements

<<<

, restrictions on carrying out operations in environmentally sensitive and littoral areas. Environmental regulations are expected to become even more severe in the future, with the consequence that the costs of compliance in all probability

<<<

 will increase. If Tethys Oil fails to comply with applicable environmental rules, there is a risk that the Company will not obtain necessary permits to retain its existing, or acquire new licenses or interests in licenses and/or be obliged

<<<

 to pay fines or be subject to other sanctions, which could have a significant negative effect on the Company's financial position and earnings. Combustion of fossil fuel, such as oil and natural gas, creates among others carbon dioxide, increasing

<<<

 the total carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere, which may contribute to the so called greenhouse effect and might also cause acidification. With regard to these environmental aspects, discharges of this kind may be subject to special fiscal

<<<

 regulations or fees. This could decrease the demand for oil and natural gas, which may have a negative effect on Tethys Oil's future financial position and earnings.
Key personnel Tethys Oil is dependent on certain key personnel, some of whom

<<<

 have founded the company at the same time as they are existing shareholders and members of the board of directors of the company. These people are important for the successful development and prospects of Tethys Oil. If key personnel leave

<<<

 Tethys Oil, this might have a negative effect on the Company's business and operations, at least in the short term. There is no guarantee that Tethys Oil will be able to recruit or retain the personnel required to operate and develop Tethys

<<<

 Oil's activities. A shortage of such operational personnel may significantly impair the Company's ability to fulfil its projects.
6

Licenses It cannot be guaranteed that Tethys Oil has obtained a correct picture of the ownership of its licenses

<<<

 and concessions, which could lead to the Company's rights being questioned in whole or in part. Therefore, despite the fact that the Company obtained license for each concession, the risk that the Company's right in regards to each concession

<<<

 can be limited in part or as a whole, cannot be disregarded. Should this occur, it could have a considerably negative effect on the Company's financial position and earnings. Tethys Oils direct interests are held through agreements with host

<<<

 countries, for example licenses or production sharing agreements. These agreements are often limited in time and there are no guarantees that the agreements can be extended when a time limit is reached. Should such a license or agreement not

<<<

 be extended, it may have a significantly adverse effect to the Company's financial position and result. The licenses regarding Block 3 and 4 expire in its current shape before the end of 2012. Tethys Oil has submitted a Field Development Plan

<<<

 which may result in new terms governing the extent for all or parts of the license area. There are no guarantees that an extension will cover all the current license area. The Company's production levels may be significantly reduced if such

<<<

 extension only covers parts of the license area.
Competition The oil and natural gas market is characterised by severe competition, especially as regards to acquisition of proven reserves. Many of Tethys Oil's competitors have larger financial

<<<

 reserves than Tethys Oil. This entails that Tethys Oil's ability to find new reserves in the future will depend on the Company's ability to exploit existing assets, select and acquire suitable oil and natural gas producing assets or prospecting

<<<

 licenses, which allow for future prospecting and cost efficient distribution and sale of oil and natural gas. Increased competition could adversely affect the Company's business, financial position and result. Development of alternative sources

<<<

 of energy, such as wind energy and fuel cells, which are equally or more cost-efficient compared to oil and natural gas may have a considerably negative effect on Tethys Oil's future financial position and earnings.
Collaborations In cases

<<<

 where Tethys Oil does not hold the license and/or is the operator of the assets, the Company's operations are conducted through collaboration methods with different parties. Thus, the Company is dependent on the acts of its partners/operators

<<<

, which may result in reduced flexibility on the part of the Company's possibility to control operations. The Company and its partners have undertakings and liabilities, which may entail joint and in some cases several liability. This means

<<<

 that if a partner cannot fulfil its obligations or meet its liabilities, other partners are not relieved of their respective obligations and responsibilities and may even be responsible for the obligations of the defaulting partner. In situations

<<<

 where the Company's rights originate from third party agreements entered into by the Company's partners/ operators, there may be a risk that through negligence or omission by such partner/operator, the Company will not be able to obtain or

<<<

 fulfil its contractual rights and/or result in situation occurring, whereby Tethys Oil loses its rights. Should this occur, it could have a considerably negative effect on the Company's financial position and earnings.
7

Taxation Tethys Oil

<<<

 will carry out operations in a number of different countries. Fiscal regulations in different countries are often complicated, and subject to changes over time. As a consequence it cannot be excluded that changes in taxation legislation may

<<<

 negatively affect Tethys Oil's financial position and earnings.
Infrastructure The Group is dependent on accessible and well-developed infrastructure in the areas where it has operations. This includes roads, electricity and water supply, pipelines

<<<

 and collection systems. If there are disruptions or damage to infrastructure, the Group's business may suffer considerably, which may lead to lower production and sales and/or higher costs. Also, inclement weather conditions may interfere with

<<<

 or delay shipments and deliveries of oil by sea.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets as fluctuations in exchange rates can negatively affect the operating profit, cash flow and equity.

<<<

 The major proportion of the Group's assets relate to international oil and gas discoveries valued in USD and which generate revenues in USD. The exchange risk effect the Group by transaction risk and translation risk.
Transaction risk Transaction

<<<

 exposure arises in the cash flow when invoicing or the costs of invoiced goods and services are not in the local currency. By operating in several countries, Tethys Oil is exposed to fluctuations in a number of currencies. USD was the main

<<<

 currency with regard to invoices paid and revenues received during 2011. Income will also most likely be denominated in foreign currencies, especially USD. Tethys Oil does not currently hedge exchange rates.
Translation risk Exchange-rate changes

<<<

 affect the Group in conjunction with the translation of the income statements of foreign subsidiaries to SEK as the Group's operating profit is affected and when net assets in foreign subsidiaries are translated into SEK which can negatively

<<<

 affect the Group's operating profit and statement of financial position. The Group does not hedge its translation exposure and fluctuating currency rates might negatively affect the operating profit and financial position of the Group.
Liquidity

<<<

 risks and capital risk By operating in several countries, Tethys Oil is exposed to fluctuations in a number of currencies. Income is and will also most likely be denominated in foreign currencies, USD in particular. Furthermore, Tethys Oil

<<<

 has since inception been equity financed through share issues and financed by asset divestment. Additional capital may be needed to finance Tethys Oil's future operations and/or for acquisition of additional licences. The main risk is that

<<<

 this need may occur during less favourable market conditions.
Financial risk As part of an investment agreement with Odin Energi SA ("Odin Energi") regarding investments in Lithuania, Tethys Oil has lent EUR 15,200,000, equivalent of SEK 1

<<<

36,278,000, to Odin Energi. The loan is secured by a pledge of 30 per cent of the share capital of Odin Energi. The receivable on Odin Energi is subject to counterparty risks and the Company's ability to receive payment of the receivable is

<<<

 dependent on
8

the performance of Odin Energi's operations and its financial position. In the event of bankruptcy, re organisation or wind-up of Odin Energi, the Company may not receive full, or any, payment.
RISKS RELATING TO THE BONDS Credit

<<<

 risks Investors in the Bonds carry a credit risk relating to the Company. The investor's ability to receive payment under the Terms and Conditions is therefore dependent on the Company's ability to meet its payment obligations, which in turn

<<<

 is largely dependent upon the performance of the Company's operations and its financial position. The Company's financial position is affected by several factors of which a number have been discussed above.
An increased credit risk may cause

<<<

 the market to charge the Bonds a higher risk premium, which would negatively affect the Bonds' value. Another aspect of the credit risk is that a deteriorating financial position of the Company may reduce the Company's possibility to receive

<<<

 debt financing at the time of the maturity of the Bonds.
Interest rate risks The Bonds' value depends on several factors, one of the most significant being the level of market interest. Investments in the Bonds involve a risk that the market

<<<

 value of the Bonds may be adversely affected by an increase in market interest rates.
Liquidity risks The Company intends to apply for listing of the Bonds on OMX. However, the Company cannot guarantee that the Bonds will be admitted to trading

<<<

. Further, even if securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, active trading in the securities does not always occur and hence there are no guarantees that a liquid market for trading in the Bonds will occur or be maintained even

<<<

 if the Bonds are listed. The result may be that the bondholders cannot sell their Bonds when desired or at a price level which allows for a profit comparable to similar investments with an active and functioning secondary market. Lack of liquidity

<<<

 in the market may have a negative impact on the market value of the Bonds. Furthermore, the nominal value of the Bonds may not be indicative compared to the market price of the Bonds if the Bonds are admitted for trading on OMX.
It should also

<<<

 be noted that during a given time period it may be difficult or impossible to sell the Bonds (at all or on reasonable terms) due to, for example, severe price fluctuations, close down of the relevant market or trade restrictions imposed on

<<<

 the market.
Risks relating to the clearing and settlement in Euroclear's book-entry system The Bonds are affiliated to Euroclear's account-based system, and no physical notes have been, or will be, issued. Clearing and settlement relating to

<<<

 the Bonds is carried out within Euroclear's book-entry system as well as payment of interest and repayment of principal. Investors are therefore dependent on the functionality of Euroclear's account-based system for timely and accurate payment

<<<

.
Risks relating to early redemption Under the Terms and Conditions, the Company has reserved the ability to redeem all outstanding Bonds before the final redemption date. If the Bonds are redeemed before the final redemption date, the
9

bondholders

<<<

 have the right to receive an early redemption amount which exceeds the nominal amount. However, there is a risk that the market value of the Bonds is higher than the early redemption amount. Preferential rights Other than a SEK 500,000 security

<<<

 related to the Company's lease agreement, the Company currently has no other material undertakings with regard to loans from banks or other credit institutions. The Company may however in the future decide to take up loans from such institutions

<<<

. Such loans may constitute a priority claim on the Company. Subject to possible restrictions in the Terms and Conditions, the Company may further decide to issue other market loans. The Bonds are secured through a pledge over all shares in

<<<

 Tethys Oil Block 3&4 Ltd. granted by the Company. There can be no guarantee that the pledged assets will be sufficient for the bondholders should the pledge be realised. Other than the security created under the aforementioned pledge, the bonds

<<<

 represent an unsecured obligation of the Company. This means that in the event of bankruptcy, re-organisation or wind-up of the Company, the holders of the bonds normally receive payment after any priority creditors have been fully paid. Each

<<<

 investor should be aware that there is a risk that an investor in the Bonds loses all or part of their investment if the Company becomes bankrupt, carries out a re-organisation or is wound-up Bondholders ' meetings The Terms and Conditions

<<<

 include certain conditions regarding bondholders' meetings. Such meetings may be held in order to resolve on matters relating to the bondholders' interests. The Terms and Conditions allow for stated majorities to bind all bondholders, including

<<<

 bondholders who have not taken part in the meeting and those who have voted differently to the required majority at a duly convened and conducted bondholders' meeting. Amended or new legislation This Prospectus and the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 are based on Swedish law in force at the issue date. No assurance can be given on the impact of any possible future legislative measures or changes or modifications to administrative practices. Amended or new legislation and administrative

<<<

 practices may adversely affect the investor's ability to receive payment under the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds.

The Bonds in brief
This Section contains a general and broad description o f the Bonds. It does not claim to be comprehensive

<<<

 or cover all details o f the Bonds. Potential investors should therefore carefully consider this Prospectus as a whole, including documents incorporated by reference, before a decision is made to invest in the Bonds. The full terms and conditions

<<<

 for the Bonds can befound in the Section "Terms and Conditionsfor the Bonds".
Concepts and terms defined in the Section "Terms and Conditionsfor the Bonds"are used with the same meaning in this summary unless otherwise is explicitly understoodfrom

<<<

 the context.
The issue of the Bonds was resolved by the Company's board of directors on 31 August 2012. The Bonds were issued through a so called private placement. The issue date for the Bonds was 7 September 2012 and the Bonds will mature

<<<

 on 7 September 2015 (the Final Redemption Date). No Bonds have been issued, or will be issued, after 7 September 2012 and the bond loan was subscribed in full on the Issue Date.
The Bonds have been issued in accordance with the Financial Instruments

<<<

 Accounts Act (Sw. lag (1998:1479) om kontoforing av finansiella instrument) in electronic book-entry form and are registered on behalf of the Holders on a Securities Account. No physical notes have been or will be issued. The Bonds constitute

<<<

 direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Company and shall at all times rank pari passu without any preference among them. The main purpose of the Bond Issue is to raise funds to be applied towards general corporate

<<<

 purposes, whereof not less than SEK 200,000,000 shall be applied towards capital expenditures in relation to the Oman Block 3 and 4.
The bond loan amounts to a maximum of SEK 400,000,000 and is represented by Bonds, each of a nominal amount

<<<

 of SEK 1,000,000 or full multiples thereof. The Bonds are denominated in SEK. The ISIN for the Bonds is SE0004808129. Payment of principal, interest and, if applicable, withholding of preliminary tax will be made through Euroclear's book-entry

<<<

 system.
The Company shall redeem all outstanding Bonds at 100.00 per cent of the Nominal Amount together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Final Redemption Date, unless previously redeemed, pre-paid or repurchased and cancelled in accordance

<<<

 with Section 9 (Early redemption by request o f the Company), Section 10 (Mandatory Redemption), Section 13 (The Group Companies'purchase o f Bonds), Section 16 (Change o f Control) or Section 17 (Acceleration o f the Bonds) of the Terms and

<<<

 Conditions. Payment in respect of principal and interest shall be made to the person who is a Holder on the Record Date immediately preceding the relevant payment date. The right to receive payment of the Nominal Amount is time-barred and becomes

<<<

 void ten years from the relevant Redemption Date.
The Bonds bear interest from, but excluding, the Issue Date up to, and including, the relevant redemption date at an interest rate of 9.50 per cent per annum. The interest is paid semi-annually

<<<

 in arrears on each Interest Payment Date and is calculated on a 30/360-days basis. The Interest Payment Dates are 7 March and 7 September each year (with the first Interest Payment Date being 7 March 2013 and the last Interest Payment Date

<<<

 being the Final Redemption Date). The right to receive payment of interest is time-barred and becomes void three years from the relevant due date for payment. Swedish Trustee AB (publ) is initially acting as Bond Trustee in relation to the

<<<

 Bonds and, if relevant, the other Finance Documents. Even without separate authorisation from the Holders and without having to obtain any Holder's consent (if not required to
12

do so under the Terms and Conditions), the Bond Trustee, or

<<<

 a person appointed by the Bond Trustee, is entitled to represent the Holders in every matter concerning the Bonds, the Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents and is authorised to act on behalf of the Holders whether or not in

<<<

 court or before an executive authority (including any legal or arbitration proceeding relating to the perfection, preservation, protection or enforcement of the Bonds and the other Finance Documents). Each Holder shall immediately upon request

<<<

 by the Bond Trustee provide the Bond Trustee with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance to the Bond Trustee's satisfaction), which the Bond Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out its

<<<

 duties under the Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents. The Bond Trustee is under no obligation to represent a Holder which does not comply with such a request of the Bond Trustee.
Each of the Company, the Bond Trustee and Holders

<<<

 representing at least 10 per cent of the total outstanding Nominal Amount, may request that a Holders' meeting is convened or request a procedure in writing among the Holders, see further Section 19 (Holders'meeting and procedure in writing

<<<

) of the Terms and Conditions. Such meetings or procedures in writing can lead to that a majority decision is passed, binding on all Holders.
The Agent Agreement entered into between the Bond Trustee and the Company on or about the Issue Date

<<<

 regarding, inter alia, the remuneration payable to the Bond Trustee is available to the investors at the Company's office. As a continuing security for the due and punctual fulfilment of the Company's obligations under the Terms and Conditions

<<<

 and the Agent Agreement, the Company has entered into or will enter into the Pledge Agreements set out in Section 4 (Security) of the Terms and Conditions for the benefit of the Holders and the Bond Trustee.
If the Bonds have been declared

<<<

 due and payable due to an Event of Default, the available funds (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any funds originating from the enforcement of the security under the Finance Documents) shall, unless otherwise stipulated in the Finance

<<<

 Documents, firstly be applied towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee, and any remuneration payable to the Bond Trustee, under the Terms and Conditions and the Agent Agreement, and secondly towards payment of

<<<

 interest owed by the Company to the Holders under the Terms and Conditions, and thirdly towards payment of principal owed by the Company to the Holders under the Terms and Conditions. The surplus, if any, shall promptly be transferred to the

<<<

 Company.

<<<

 with its registered office in Stockholm, Sweden, and its legal form is regulated by the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)). The registered address of the Company is Hovslagargatan 5 B, first floor, SE-111 48 Stockholm,

<<<

 Sweden. The shares of the Company are listed on First North (TETY) in Stockholm. Remium AB is Certified Adviser.
The object of the Company's business, which is set forth in paragraph 3 of its articles of association, is to explore for and exploit

<<<

 gas and oil and activities compatible therewith, either directly, through its subsidiaries, associated companies or other forms o f partnerships. The current articles o f association were adopted at the annual general meeting held on 25 May

<<<

 2011.
Tethys Oil was founded in 2001, by Vincent Hamilton, John Hoey and Magnus Nordin and was awarded its first licence onshore Denmark in 2002. In 2003, interests in three Spanish licences were acquired. Subsequently, opportunities in Turkey

<<<

 were evaluated resulting in the signing of an agreement covering three Turkish licences in December 2003. A second Danish licence was awarded in 2003 and an application for an additional exploration licence in Spain was filed. Tethys Oil conducted

<<<

 an IPO in March 2004 and was listed for trading on Nya Marknaden (the predecessor o f First North) in Stockholm on 6 April 2004.
As a public company, Tethys Oil has participated in a number of projects and depending on results some licences

<<<

 have been relinquished and others have been added. In 2006, Tethys Oil acquired interests in Block 15 onshore Oman which covered the Jebel Aswad ("JAS") appraisal project. Following the successful JAS-1 re-entry well, Tethys Oil proceeded to

<<<

 strengthen its presence in Oman by the acquisition in 2007 of interests in Omani Block 3 and 4. As a result, the Sultanate of Oman has become Tethys' main theatre of operations.

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS Tethys Oil is a Swedish energy company, which together with its Subsidiaries is focused

<<<

 on exploration for and production of oil and natural gas. Tethys Oil aims to maintain a well balanced portfolio of high risk/high reward exploration opportunities coupled with lower risk exploration and appraisal development assets. The company

<<<

's strategy is twofold; to explore for oil and natural gas near existing and developing markets; and to develop proven reserves that have previously been sub-economic due to location or technological reasons. As at 30 June 2012 the company had

<<<

 interests in licences in Oman, France, Sweden and Lithuania.
The licences of the Company are set out in the table below.

*Tethys Oil's interests in Lithuania are held together with Odin Energi (see further Section "Odin

<<<

 Energi"below).

In Tethys Oil's oil and natural gas operations there are two main categories of agreements; one that governs the relationship with the host country and one that governs the relationship with partners. The agreements that govern

<<<

 the relationship with host countries are referred to as licences or exploration and production sharing agreements. Tethys Oil holds its interest directly through aforementioned agreements in Oman, France and Sweden. The agreements with host

<<<

 countries have a time limit and are normally divided into periods. Financial commitments and or work commitments normally relates to the different periods. Tethys Oil has fulfilled its commitments on Block 15 and Blocks 3 and 4 in Oman for

<<<

 the current period. In the other areas of operations the commitments are either fulfilled or there are no commitments of which Tethys Oil can be held liable for. In some of Tethys Oil's areas of interest there are requirements of work to be

<<<

 done or minimum expenditures in order to retain the licences, but no commitments of which Tethys Oil can be held liable for. The agreements that govern the relationship with partners are referred to as joint operating agreements. Except for

<<<

 Sweden where Tethys Oil is the sole licence holder, Tethys Oil has joint operating agreements with its partners in all areas of operation. Other than the aforementioned agreements, there are no individual agreements or similar circumstances

<<<

 relating to the business which are of crucial significance for the group's operations or profitability.

17

Oman Oman is Tethys Oil's core area and the Company has interests in three onshore licences covering an area exceeding 30,000 square

<<<

 kilometres, which makes Tethys Oil one of the largest onshore oil and gas concession-holder in Oman. For detailed information regarding partners and interests, please see the table above. Block 3 and 4 Block 3 and 4 are situated in the eastern

<<<

 part of Oman and covers a combined area of more than 30,000 square kilometres. Tethys Oils' share of the production, before government take, amounts to 30 per cent and its share of the production in 2011 amounted to 423,469 barrels of oil.

<<<

 22 new wells, including 18 production & appraisal wells, were drilled on the Blocks in 2011. There are two drillings rigs in operation currently working the Farha trend on Block 3, focusing on expanding into new fault blocks, as well as drilling

<<<

 new production and water injection wells in already producing areas.
The oil from the Farha South and Saiwan East oil fields on Block 3 and 4 has so far been produced under the Early Production System. The Field Development Plan, focused on

<<<

 the Farha South and Saiwan East oil fields, has been submitted to the Omani government for review and approval. Production will continue under the Early Production System until the Field Development Plan has been approved. The work on a more

<<<

 permanent system is making good progress with infrastructure developments. Several major units have been constructed. Tethys Oil has contingent resources on Block 3 and 4 onshore Oman. The contingent resources are only contingent on the finalization

<<<

 and the final approval of the Field Development Plan. In 2009, a test was conducted to verify the mobility of the heavy oil on Saiwan East on Block 4. Liquid samples were obtained from three of the four zones tested. The Company believes that

<<<

 the results are cautiously encouraging, however any potential production of heavy oil in Saiwan East will require enhanced oil recovery techniques. Agreement with Mitsui During 2010, Tethys Oil entered into an agreement with Mitsui E&P Middle

<<<

 East B.V. ("Mitsui"), whereby Mitsui acquired 20 per cent in Block 3 and 4 onshore Oman. Apart from the cash consideration amounting to USD 20,000,000, Mitsui undertook to fund Tethys Oil's share of non-exploration related capital expenditure

<<<

 up to USD 60,000,000 on Blocks 3 and 4 effectively from 1 January 2010. As per 31 December 2011, Mitsui had fulfilled the undertaking and there were no remaining carry value outstanding. Mitsui will recover the USD 60,000,000 paid on behalf

<<<

 of Tethys Oil from the proceeds of Tethys' share of future cost recovery production entitlement. As part of the agreement Mitsui will pay to Tethys Oil a production bonus amounting to USD 10,000,000 if commercial production exceeds 10,000 barrels

<<<

 of oil per day for 30 consecutive days. Given that this volume has already been achieved during test production, the Company is hopeful that the rate will also be met once commercial production has been established and that the bonus payment

<<<

 will be paid out during 2012.2For further information, please see Section "Recent events'"below.

Block 15 Block 15 is situated in

<<<

 the north western part of central Oman and covers an area of about 1,400 square kilometres. Two wells have been drilled since Tethys Oil entered the licence. The JAS-2 well flowed only water when tested in 2008. In December 2011, a test was

<<<

 launched with the attempt to pump off the water with jet pumps and enable the well to flow hydrocarbons. The test yielded small amounts of oil and gas, but the water did not diminish. The results suggest that the hydrocarbons trapped in the

<<<

 JAS-2 sidetrack cannot be economically produced due to the low porosity of the reservoir rock together with the permeable water bearing fractures. Therefore the JAS 2 horizontal section is now suspended and will probably be abandoned in the

<<<

 future. Work will still be done on the vertical part of the well, in order to better understand the geology of the potentially hydrocarbon bearing lower Shuaiba formation, below the Natih formation. The Shuaiba formation produces gas condensate

<<<

 from the Wadi Rafash field in the adjacent Block 9.
The main efforts on Block 15 will focus on finding the most economic method of putting the JAS-1 well in production. JAS-1 flowed gas and condensate when tested in 2007. An extension of the

<<<

 3D seismic survey shot in 2008 is also planned before drilling activities will resume.
Lithuania Tethys Oil holds interests in three Lithuanian licences. All licences are onshore and cover some 4,000 square kilometres of the Baltic Sedimentary

<<<

 Basin. For detailed information regarding partners and interests, please see the table above.
The Gargzdai licence The Gargzdai licence is located in western Lithuania. The daily gross production amounts to about 700 barrels of around 42 degree

<<<

 API oil. In total, 15 million barrels of oil have been produced from Cambrian sandstone reservoirs. The Gargzdai licence's proven and probable oil reserves are in excess of 6 million barrels and proven, probable and possible reserves amount

<<<

 to more than 12 million barrels. A reservoir study made on the licence area suggests that the reserves could be significantly increased with the use of modern alternative oil recovery techniques. The licence also holds significant unconventional

<<<

 hydrocarbon potential, including exposure to Silurian/Ordovician shale sections. The interest will be held in partnership with Odin Energi, giving the Company a net indirect interest of 25 per cent. For further information, please see Section

<<<

 "Odin Energi" below.
The Rietavas and Raiseiniai licences The Rietavas licence is located close to the Gargzdai licence, with a known oil discovery in the Cambrian sandstones, the same reservoir layer which is in production in Gargzdai. The

<<<

 Rietavas licence is for the moment quite unexplored. The Raiseiniai licence covers a so far unexplored trend of Silurian reefs similar to, but expected to be of larger size, to the Ordovician reefs found on Gotland. The Silurian/Ordovician

<<<

 shale section is present also in the Rietavas and Raiseiniai licences. The interests will be held in partnership with Odin Energi, giving the Company a net indirect interest of 20 per cent. For further information, please see Section "Odin

<<<

 Energi" below.
Odin Energi The Company has agreed with Odin Energi to acquire interests in the Lithuanian oil companies UAB Minijos Nafta, which holds the Gargzdai license, and UAB LL Investicos, wich holds the Rietavas and Raiseiniai
19



<<<

licenses. The interests will be held in partnership with Odin Energi, giving Tethys Oil a net indirect interest of 25 per cent in UAB Minijos Nafta and 20 per cent in UAB LL Investicos. Tethys Oil acquired its 20 per cent indirect interest

<<<

 for USD 3,500,000, equivalent of SEK 23,951,000. The Company has received newly issued shares in an Odin group company for the holding of UAB LL Investicos. In order to enable the transfer of shares in Odin group companies for Tethys Oil's

<<<

 holding in UAB Minijos Nafta, a reconstruction of the Odin group is ongoing.
France Tethys Oil has interests in two French licences, Permis du Bassin D'Ales, which is an exploration and production licence in the Ales basin in southern France

<<<

 and the Attila licence, located in the oil and gas producing Paris basin, some 250 kilometres east of Paris. For detailed information regarding partners and interests, please see the table above.
Permis du Bassin D 'Ales In April 2011, Tethys

<<<

 Oil acquired 37.5 per cent interest in a second French licence, Bassin D'Ales, from private Swiss company MouvOil S.A. Bassin D'Ales is an exploration and production licence covering 215 square kilometres in the department of Gard in southern

<<<

 France. The licence area covers part of the Ales basin including the Maruejols heavy oil field discovered in 1947. The field is delineated by nine wells and has produced small amounts of 14 degree API oil, during 1947-1950 and 1980-1982. The

<<<

 licence also covers at least two prospects with potential for conventional oil at respective depths of 1,400 and 2,000 metres. A feasibility study of a heavy oil field on the Ales licence has been launched, with a view to recommend the most

<<<

 suitable pilot productions system. Further, a seismic interpretation as well as reprocessing of old seismic is ongoing and a 2D seismic study as well as a first exploration well is planned for at the end of 2012.
The Attila licence One well

<<<

 has been drilled on the Attila licence. The Company'sobjective was to find natural gas accumulations. PLM-2 spudded in 2007, and the well was drilled to a depth of 1,310 metres. During drilling, gas shows were recorded and wireline logging

<<<

 confirmed the indications of gas, but the well tested only a minor gas flows. The PLM-2 well is not commercial in its current state.
Sweden The Company holds two licences in Sweden called Gotland Större and Gotland Mindre. The licences covers

<<<

 an area of about 581 square kilometres over the northern part of the Baltic island Gotland. For detailed information regarding partners and interests, please see the table above.
Gotland The 2011 soil sampling survey over parts of the license

<<<

 area on Gotland gave encouraging results. The analysis was focused on interpreting the data from samples taken from above known reefal prospects that have been identified on existing seismic lines and have not been drilled. So far some 10 potential

<<<

 locations for exploratory drilling have been identified and the Company is investigating the possibility to conduct drilling operations on Gotland.
