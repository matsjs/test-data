 accordance with Clause 17.1 by reference to a

specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, in accordance

with these Terms and Conditions, to waive such Event of Default (temporarily or

permanently).

<<<

 However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not

33

prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under Clause 17.1 (e).

17.3

If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of

<<<

 a court of law or a government

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.

17.4

The Issuer is obliged

<<<

 to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 17.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur

<<<

,

provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under

no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in

Clause 17.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent

details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 17.1 and provide the Agent with all

documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 17.

17.5

The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent

<<<

 according to Clause 17.4 if informing the

Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with Nasdaq

Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) or First North Stockholm. If such

a conflict would

<<<

 exist pursuant to the listing contract with the relevant Regulated Market,

First North Stockholm or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the

approval from the relevant Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable

<<<

 measures,

including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to

timely inform the Agent according to Clause 17.4.

17.6

If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there

<<<

 is an

Event of Default under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 17.1, the Agent

shall (i) notify, within five (5) Business Days of the day of notification or determination, the

Holders of the Event of Default and (ii) decide

<<<

, within twenty (20) Business Days of the day

of notification or determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the Agent has

decided not to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the

Holders

<<<

 that there exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders

according to the provisions in Clause 19 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in

favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds

<<<

, the Agent shall

promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to

the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the

Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at

<<<

 the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the

cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time

necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default (or an event

that

<<<

 may lead to an Event of Default).

17.7

If the Holders have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 19

(Decisions by Holders) or instructed the Agent in accordance with Clause 17.1, the Agent

shall promptly declare

<<<

 the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable to take action

if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders

34

17.8 17.9 17.10 18. 18.1
18.2
18.3

agree in writing to indemnify and

<<<

 hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 1

<<<

7, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 17 without

<<<

 relevant decision by the Agent or following instructions from the Holders pursuant to Clause 17.1 or Clause 19 (Decisions by Holders).
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with this Clause 17, the Issuer shall redeem all

<<<

&&& Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to the applicable Call Option Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
If the Bonds have been declared due and payable in accordance with Clause 17 (Termination o f the Bonds

(a) firstly, in or towards payment pro rata of (i) all unpaid fees, costs, expenses

(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of

 any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and
(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs

<<<

 (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue

<<<

 or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in Clause 18.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement

<<<

 by way of a corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 18.1.
Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the termination of the Bonds constitute escrow funds (Sw. redovisningsmedel) according to the Escrow

 was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Agent was dismissed through a decision by the Holders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which

<<<

 regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.
The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes

<<<

 of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents.
The Agent's resignation or dismissal shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor Agent and acceptance by such successor Agent of such appointment and the execution

<<<

 of all necessary documentation to effectively substitute the retiring Agent.
Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled

<<<

 to the benefit of the Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Agent. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Holders shall have the same rights

<<<

 and obligations amongst themselves under the Finance Documents as they would have had if such successor had been the original Agent.
In the event that there is a change of the Agent in accordance with this Clause 23.4, the Issuer shall execute

<<<

 such documents and take such actions as the new Agent may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new Agent the rights, powers and obligation of the Agent and releasing the retiring Agent from its further obligations under the

<<<

 Finance Documents. Unless the Issuer and the new Agent agrees otherwise, the new Agent shall be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Agent.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING AGENT
The Issuer appoints the

<<<

 Issuing Agent to manage certain specified tasks under these Terms and Conditions and in accordance with the legislation, rules and regulations applicable to and/or issued by the CSD and relating to the Bonds.
The Issuing Agent may retire from

<<<

 its assignment or be dismissed by the Issuer, provided that the Issuer has approved that a commercial bank or securities institution approved by the
44

CSD accedes as new Issuing Agent at the same time as the old Issuing Agent retires or

<<<

 is dismissed. If the Issuing Agent is insolvent, the Issuer shall immediately appoint a new Issuing Agent, which shall replace the old Issuing Agent as issuing agent in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

26.2

Clause 26.1 shall not apply if

unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in

<<<



accordance with Clause 23.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such

failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by

the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity

<<<

 due to the Agent under the Finance

Documents or by any reason described in Clause 23.2.10, such failure must continue for at

least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 23.2.11 before a Holder may
