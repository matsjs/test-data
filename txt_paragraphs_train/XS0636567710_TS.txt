, and none of the Parent, the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer, the Existing Notes Trustees or the Exchange and Tabulation Agent (or any of their respective directors, employees or affiliates) makes any recommendation as to whether Holders of Relevant

<<<

 2016/2017 Notes should offer any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers and/or participate in the Consent Solicitations. The Exchange and Tabulation Agent is the agent of the Parent and does not owe any duty to

Neither the delivery of this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum nor any exchange of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers and/or participation in the Consent Solicitations shall, under any circumstances

INDUSTRY AND MARKET INFORMATION The information contained in "Exchange Rates", "Summary

<<<

" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results o f Operations"" includes extracts from information and data, including industry and market data and estimates from publicly available resources and industry and

<<<

 market consultants. Although we believe such sources to be reliable and we accept responsibility for the accurate extraction and reproduction of such information and data, we have not independently verified the accuracy of such information

<<<

 and data and we do not accept further responsibility in respect thereof. In particular, information and data contained in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum relating to the publication paper industry and certain economic

<<<

 measures have been extracted or derived from reports, presentations or other sources produced by, among others, the Pulp and Paper Products Council ("PPPC") and Resource Information System, Inc. ("RISI"). The accuracy of such information is

<<<

 subject to the availability and reliability of the data supporting such information and neither the published information nor the underlying data has been independently verified by us. In addition, the methodology of each of PPPC and RISI and

<<<

 of other industry sources for collecting, analyzing and presenting information and data, and therefore the reported information, may differ from that used by us to compile data relating to our operations and from the methodologies employed

<<<

 by other industry consultants and participants. Each of PPPC and RISI and other industry sources may use certain information and data that is not accurate and may use certain assumptions in the preparation of their reported information, and

<<<

 such assumptions could prove to be inaccurate. No assurance can be given that the third-party information used in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum reflects all relevant events and transactions occurring in the relevant

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION
Financial Data
This exchange offer and consent solicitation

<<<

 memorandum includes at Exhibit I the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 (and incorporates by reference the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of and

<<<

 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013) (together, the "Audited Consolidated Financial Statements"). This exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum also includes at Exhibit II the condensed consolidated financial statements

<<<

 of the Parent as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (with September 30, 2014 comparative financial statements) (the "Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" and, together with the Audited Consolidated Financial

<<<

 Statements, the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). For purposes of this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum, references to "our" financial information or results of operations refer to the financial information or results

<<<

 of operations of the Parent.
On January 1, 2015, the Parent changed its accounting principles with respect to embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway. As a result, the Parent restated, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the

<<<

 nine months ended September 30, 2014, the items impacted by this change in its accounting principles and presented such restated items in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum. See "Summary Consolidated Financial and Other

<<<

 Data" and "Selected Historical Financial Data".
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as adopted by the European Union and are presented in Norwegian

<<<

 kroner. The Parent is the holding company of the Group. The Parent's shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "NSG".
Our unaudited consolidated statement of income data for the twelve months ended September 30, 

<<<

2015 has been derived by adding our historical consolidated statement of income data for the financial year ended December 31, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and subtracting our historical consolidated statement of income

<<<

 data for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
IFRS differs in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The Parent has not prepared and does not currently intend to prepare its Consolidated

<<<

 Financial Statements in, or reconcile them to, U.S. GAAP. Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
The financial information included in this exchange

<<<

 offer and consent solicitation memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC.
Pro Forma Financial Information
We present in this exchange offer and consent solicitation

<<<

 memorandum certain unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information as at and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma financial information set

<<<

 forth in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ from the actual adjusted amounts.
Our unaudited pro forma

<<<

 financial data presented herein has been prepared for informational purposes only, and does not purport to represent what our actual financial position or consolidated interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on (i) September

<<<

 30, 2015, for the purposes of the calculation of pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities and pro forma secured net interest-bearing liabilities and (ii) October 1, 2014, for the purposes of the calculation of pro forma net cash finance costs

<<<

, nor does it purport to represent our consolidated interest expense or actual financial position at any future date. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future results following the consummation of the Transactions. The unaudited

<<<

 pro forma financial data presented in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards.

<<<


Rounding
Certain amounts that appear in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum, including financial data and operating data, have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables

<<<

 may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them and amounts expressed as percentages may not total 100% when aggregated.
xix

Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures
In the income statement of our Consolidated Financial

<<<

 Statements, we present gross operating earnings for the Group, and in our segment reporting, we assess the performance of our operating segments based on a measure of gross operating earnings. Gross operating earnings excludes the effects of

<<<

 expenditure not deemed to be part of regular operating activities. Gross operating earnings represents operating earnings before depreciation, restructuring expenses, other gains and losses (such as gains and losses from sales of non-current

<<<

 assets and changes in the fair value of certain energy contracts and biological assets) and impairments. In the section of this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum titled "Management's Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition

<<<

 and Results o f Operations'", we discuss the operating performance of the Group and our operating segments based on gross operating earnings, which measure is presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In certain other sections of

<<<

 this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum, including "Summary" and "Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data"", we use the term "EBITDA", in lieu of the term gross operating earnings due to the familiarity of the term EBITDA

<<<

 to prospective investors in the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes. In this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum, EBITDA is defined on the same basis as gross operating earnings. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit/loss, see "Summary

<<<

 Consolidated Financial and Other Data"".
This exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum presents non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA, capital expenditures, cash conversion, net secured interest-bearing liabilities, net interest

<<<

-bearing debt, pro forma secured net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma finance costs and the related leverage and coverage ratios calculated using such non-IFRS measures that are not required

<<<

 by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance

<<<

 and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results

<<<

 as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios such as EBITDA, capital expenditures, cash conversion, net interest-bearing debt, net secured interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma secured net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma net

<<<

 interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma finance costs and the related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies in our

<<<

 industry may calculate these measures differently and, consequently, our presentation may not be readily comparable to other companies' figures. In particular, you should not consider EBITDA or cash conversion as an alternative to (a) operating

<<<

 earnings or profit/loss for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or

<<<

 (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. EBITDA, capital expenditures, cash conversion, net secured interest-bearing liabilities, net interest-bearing debt, pro forma secured net interest-bearing

<<<

 liabilities, pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma finance costs, and the related leverage and coverage ratios have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis

<<<

 of our results as reported under IFRS.
Production Capacity
We estimate production capacity using the production capacity of our mills as a demonstrated maximum production output (in tons per year) which we derive by annualizing (based on 3

<<<

62 days) the average saleable paper production output (in tons per hour) from the three calendar months with the highest production volumes over the last twelve-month period that have a capacity utilization rate of greater than 90%. Our estimates

<<<

 of production capacity are unaudited and involve significant estimates and assumptions made by our management.
We use an average saleable production (in tons per hour) of the three calendar months with the highest production volumes in a twelve

<<<

-month period as we believe it represents an accurate approximation of the maximum capabilities of the equipment and processes, and a repeatable high-performance production rate, given the same conditions. We use months in which we achieve a

<<<

 capacity utilization rate of greater than 90% because we believe these represent periods when minimum external factors, such as scheduled stops for maintenance or holidays, have interrupted the normal operation of paper production.
We use 

<<<

362-day years because time is required each year to perform work that can only be done during a paper machine stop. Paper machine shutdowns for operational and maintenance reasons are part of normal operations and are not intended to be included

<<<

 in our estimates.
With effect from January 1, 2011, we implemented a new calculation for the measurement of capacity at all of our mills, which assumes a lower paper weight (as measured in gsm) produced at the relevant mill. This change was

<<<

 introduced in response to a general trend towards thinner and lighter paper, particularly in Europe. This change affects the comparability of capacity figures for periods prior to January 1, 2011 as the new system for measuring capacity results

<<<

 in small differences in the capacity at certain of our mills.
xx

EXCHANGE RATES

The functional currency of the Parent and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this exchange offer and consent solicitation

<<<

 memorandum is the Norwegian kroner. Certain of our indebtedness is denominated in Euro and, to a lesser extent, U.S. dollars and Australian dollars and certain of our subsidiaries use a functional currency and a presentation currency other

<<<

 than the Norwegian kroner that must be translated into Norwegian kroner for the purpose of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. See the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this exchange offer and

<<<

 consent solicitation memorandum for a description of the methodology we use to translate our financial position and results of operations from U.S. dollars or Euro to Norwegian kroner.

The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated

<<<

, certain information concerning the exchange rates for Norwegian kroner expressed in NOK per U.S.$1.00 and in NOK per 1.00, in each case based upon the Bloomberg Composite Rate and rounded to four decimal places. The Bloomberg Composite Rate

<<<

 is a "best market" calculation in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite

<<<

 Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. "Average" means the average of the exchange rates on the last business day of each month for annual averages and the average of the exchange rates on each

<<<

 business day during the relevant period for monthly averages. These exchange rates are provided only for the convenience of the reader. No representation is made that amounts in U.S.$ or  have been, could have been or could be converted into

<<<

 NOK, or vice versa.

As of December 31, 2015, the Bloomberg Composite Rate was NOK 8.8531 per U.S.$1.00 and NOK 9.6187 per 1.00.

The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain information concerning the exchange rates for

<<<

 NOK, expressed in NOK per U.S.$1.00. The rates set forth below are provided solely for your convenience and were not used by us in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this exchange offer and consent

<<<

 solicitation memorandum. No representation is made that U.S.$ could have been, or could be, converted into NOK at that rate or at any other rate.

. We are one of the world's leading producers of newsprint and are a significant producer of magazine paper by production capacity. In Europe, we operate four mills in three countries, Norway, Austria and France with 2.1 million tons of publication

<<<

 paper production capacity, making us the third largest European producer of publication paper. In Australasia (which includes Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and the neighboring islands), we operate two mills in Australia and one mill in

<<<

 New Zealand with 0.7 million tons of publication paper production capacity. We also operate Australasia's sole newsprint and magazine paper mills, making us a leading provider of publication paper in the region.
Our newsprint paper products

<<<

 include standard and improved grades, while our magazine paper products comprise uncoated super-calendared paper and light- weight coated paper. The end uses of our products are mainly newspapers and magazines, but also include catalogs, inserts

<<<

/flyers, supplements, free- sheets, directories, direct mail and brochures. Our principal geographic markets for newsprint products are Europe and Australasia, while our main geographic markets for magazine paper products are Europe, Australasia

<<<

 and North America. We sell our products in these markets under well-known brands, including Nornews, Norbright, NorX, Norstar, Norcote, Norsc, Norbook, Vantage and Tasman Directory. Our customers include publishers of leading periodicals in

<<<

 Europe, Australasia and the rest of the world, and we have long-standing relationships with many of our top tier publishing clients.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we estimate that our market shares, based on deliveries for newsprint

<<<

 and magazine paper in Europe, were approximately 13% and 6%, respectively, and that our share of sales by volume for newsprint and coated mechanical in Australasia was approximately 82% and 27%, respectively.
Over the last five years, as a

<<<

 result of a strategic refocus, we have streamlined our business through a broad range of operational initiatives and investments, which we believe have positioned our business to improve its profitability and cash flow generation.
Across our

<<<

 Group, we have implemented continuous cost-improvement initiatives, including headcount reductions and working capital management measures, to improve our cash flow. Such measures include the increased use of receivables financings as well

<<<

 as our recent investment in and completion of a thermo-mechanical pulp (or "TMP") facility at our Saugbrugs mill, which has reduced costs for electricity and pulp.
In Europe, we have improved our operating portfolio, retaining our best assets

<<<

 while strategically reducing underperforming capacity. We closed our Follum mill in Norway and sold our Parenco mill in the Netherlands in 2012. In 2015, we stopped providing financial support to the Walsum mill in Germany and it is no longer

<<<

 part of the operations of the Group. In Australasia, we have maintained revenue visibility and stability by amending and prolonging long-term contracts with the region's two largest consumers of publication paper, securing stable revenues for

<<<

 our future. At the same time, we have diversified our Australasian product mix through the addition of magazine paper production capacity at our Boyer mill, where we are now the region's sole magazine paper producer.
We expect our past investments

<<<

, when coupled with our renewed focus on key customer geographies, in Europe, where our customers are concentrated in the region's four largest economies, and in Australasia, where we are the leading producer, will enable us to benefit from

<<<

 anticipated improvements in the market for our products. In particular, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from any future declines in aggregate publication paper production capacity, any future increases in publication paper prices

<<<

 and any future improvements in publication paper mill utilization rates.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we generated NOK 8,451 million (959 million) of consolidated operating revenue and NOK 493 million (56 million) of consolidated

<<<

 EBITDA. Our Publication Paper Europe segment, our Publication Paper Australasia segment and our Other Activities segment represented 54%, 52% and (7%), respectively, of our total consolidated EBITDA for this period.

Our production and sales activities are predominantly divided in accordance with our reporting segments:

 Europe: in Europe, we operate four

<<<

 mills, including two in Norway, one in France and one in Austria:

 Bruck (Austria): our Bruck mill produces both newsprint and coated mechanical paper (or "LWC") with an annual production capacity of 125,000 tons and 270,000 tons, respectively

<<<

.

 Golbey (France): our Golbey mill is one of the leading newsprint mills in Europe, with an annual production capacity of 615,000 tons, and is strategically located in France, within easy reach of major European cities and close to important

<<<

 raw material supplies.

 Saugbrugs (Norway): our Saugbrugs mill is one of the largest and most modern producers of uncoated mechanical paper (or "SC") in the world with an annual production capacity of 510,000 tons.

 Skogn (Norway): our

<<<

 Skogn mill is the largest producer of newsprint in Norway with an annual production capacity of 570,000 tons. The mill serves customers worldwide, has its own port facilities and operates a route twice- a-week to the UK and Continental Europe

<<<

.

 Australasia: in Australasia, we operate three mills, including two in Australia and one in New Zealand:

 Albury (Australia): our Albury mill has an annual production capacity of 275,000 tons, which is approximately 76% of the newsprint

<<<

 grades used in Australia each year. The Albury mill is located in New South Wales, between Sydney and Melbourne.

 Boyer (Australia): our Boyer mill has an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons of newsprint and 140,000 tons of LWC, which

<<<

 was partially converted in 2014 to produce coated mechanical paper.

 Tasman (New Zealand): our Tasman mill supplies all of New Zealand's newsprint and telephone directory requirements, with export production throughout Asia and the South

<<<

 Pacific. The mill has an annual production capacity of 155,000 tons of newsprint.

Publication Paper Industry Trends
Europe
We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from any price increases in the European publication paper sector

<<<

. According to RISI forecasts, publication paper prices across all grades are expected to increase in 2016. Compared to price levels during the third quarter of 2015, Western European SC prices are expected to increase by 5.2%, LWC prices are

<<<

 expected to increase by 5.1% and newsprint prices are expected to increase by 8.2%. We believe these forecasts imply that the publication paper sector is showing signs of improvement from current pricing levels. Furthermore, we believe that

<<<

 the importance of print for publishers' revenue generation, publishers' investment in print sites, a stabilization of the decline of global publication paper demand and anticipated reductions in overcapacity will be factors that will influence

<<<

 positive pricing trends during the next few years.
According to PPPC, Western European newsprint demand declined by 8.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period, and 6.3% in 2014 and 5.8% in 2013. Uncoated

<<<

 mechanical paper demand declined by 1.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the prior year period, and 5.2% in 2014 and 1.6% in 2013. Coated mechanical paper demand declined by 4.5% for the nine months ended September

<<<

 30, 2015, compared to the prior year period, and 3.2% in 2014 and 7.8% in 2013. On the supply side, there have been significant capacity closures in recent years, with additional closures set to occur going forward across all grades. Burgo

<<<

 announced its plan to close its 150,000 tons LWC paper machine at its Duino mill in Italy in December 2015. SCA is expected to close its 135,000 tons newsprint machine at its Ortviken mill. Heinzel Group announced its plan to convert its 2

<<<

60,000 tons SC machine from publication paper to packaging. The operating rate for newsprint improved to 92% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to 90% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The operating rate for uncoated

<<<

 mechanical paper in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 improved to 86% compared to 85% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The operating rate for coated mechanical paper has been stable at 87% for the nine months ended September

<<<

 30, 2015, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014. We believe these industry dynamics are factors that could contribute to higher utilization rates and a potential improvement in the pricing environment in Europe.
Australasia
Similar

<<<

 to Europe, through September 30, 2015, the rate of decline of newsprint demand in Australasia fell to 12.1%, compared to 6.1% in 2014 and 17.1% in 2013. In response to reduced demand, we have significantly reduced newsprint capacity in the

<<<

 region by permanently closing one of our two paper machines at our Tasman mill in 2013, which had an annual newsprint capacity of 160,000 tons, and converting one of the paper machines at our Boyer mill from newsprint to coated mechanical,

<<<

 reducing newsprint capacity in the region by an additional 120,000 tons while adding 140,000 of LWC capacity.
In recent years, the import of publication paper into Australasia has been on a downward trend. Imports of newsprint decreased by

<<<

 3.8% in 2014 and 11.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period, while imports of coated mechanical decreased by 25.1% in 2014 and by 11.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We believe this

<<<

 decrease in imports of newsprint and coated mechanical is, in part, the result of the conversion of one of the paper machines at our Boyer mill. As the sole producer in the region, we believe we have an advantage over our competitors who must

<<<

 incur transportation costs in order to access the market. According to PPPC, demand for coated mechanical increased by 10.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period, following a decrease of 10.6% in 2

<<<

014. Because demand for coated mechanical remains significantly higher than local capacity following the conversion of our paper machine at our Boyer mill, we believe utilization rates will remain high. The SC paper market is covered solely

<<<

 by imports.
Competitive and Credit Strengths
We believe that we benefit from the following competitive and credit strengths:
Strong marketpositions in Australasia and Europe
We are the sole producer of newsprint and magazine paper in Australasia

<<<

, where we have a leading position in a concentrated newsprint and magazine paper market and compete only against imports. In Europe, we are the third largest producer of publication paper and we export products to North America, Asia and North

<<<

 Africa, which are our most important export destinations from Europe. Based on our global reach and our long-standing commitment to and experience in the publication paper segment, we believe we are a preferred supplier in Australasia and Europe

<<<

.
3

Diversified revenue base with strong visibility
We benefit from significant revenue diversification across geographies, paper grades and customers. We also benefit from long-term relationships with customers and high client retention rates

<<<

. We believe that our customer base, which includes large top tier publishing groups with strong balance sheets, recognizes the importance of having a sustainable and reliable source of publication paper. This dynamic provides us with considerable

<<<

 recurring business and revenue visibility.
In Europe, we have long-standing and stable relationships with many of our customers, including relationships with most of our customers for more than five years and relationships with many customers

<<<

 for between 10 and 20 years. We believe that the creditworthiness of our customer base is validated by our ability to enter into significant factoring facilities in Norway, France and Austria. Our European customer contracts generally provide

<<<

 for quarterly adjustments of pricing.
In Australasia, we recently completed the conversion of one paper machine at our Boyer mill in Tasmania to enable the production of coated mechanical paper. This conversion has enabled us to diversify our

<<<

 regional product mix from newsprint. We are the sole local producer of newsprint and have integrated extensively with our customers' businesses, including, for example, through warehouse and inventory management, integrated supply chain processes

<<<

, local support and other logistics services. We have long-term contracts with our two largest customers maturing in 2020, which provide us with strong revenue visibility. In addition, we are well-integrated within our customers' value chain

<<<

 due to our provision of warehousing services for newsprint customers and other logistical services. We believe that this integration provides value-added services that make us a strong preferred supplier.
Efficient cost position
The combination

<<<

 of our cost competitive assets, the strategic location of our mills and a stable supply of energy and raw materials provides us with an efficient cost position.
Economies o f scale
We benefit from economies of scale in Europe, where the scale

<<<

 of our Saugbrugs, Skogn and Golbey mills enables us to have low production costs per ton. Our mills are well-positioned to reflect demand for the high value types of paper they produce. Our mix of newsprint and magazine production capabilities

<<<

 within our mills provides us with considerable operational synergies and flexibility. In addition, we have a long-standing continuous cost improvement program and have successfully reduced a number of our operating costs, streamlined our production

<<<

 processes and increased the efficiency of our mills.
Efficient product distribution
The favorable location of our mills enables us to achieve low delivered costs in our markets. In Europe, all of our largest mills are located adjacent to waterways

<<<

 or seaports and benefit from lower transportation costs of both inbound raw materials and outbound distribution of our finished products. In Australasia, we are the sole domestic newsprint and magazine paper producer, which provides us with

<<<

 a significant cost advantage over imports, and our mills are located in close proximity to the populated areas in the region.
Stable supply sourcing
Our long-term contracts for energy and favorable sources of wood provide us with stable sources

<<<

 of supply for our most significant energy and raw material requirements. A majority of our electricity requirements, our single largest expense item, are purchased under long-term contracts. We have long-term contracts in place that cover substantially

<<<

 all of the electricity requirements for our mills in Norway, and a significant portion of the electricity requirements for our other European operations. Our Australian and New Zealand mills likewise have long-term electricity contracts in

<<<

 place, and our Tasman mill also operates a geothermal energy plant that we commissioned in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, we have long-term contracts for supplies of wood to our Australasian operations and we have long-standing relationships

<<<

 with suppliers in Norway, as we are the country's largest buyer of pulp wood. The relative stability provided by our effective supply contracting and our relationships with reliable suppliers permits strong visibility in relation to costs and

<<<

 shields our operations from electricity and fiber cost fluctuations.
Proven track record of operational streamlining and delivery on current initiatives
We have responded to long-term structural decreases in demand with the closure of several

<<<

 of our machines and mills, such as our Union and Follum mills in Norway and our Steti mill in the Czech Republic, between 2006 and 2012. We closed one of the two machines at our Tasman mill in New Zealand in 2013 and closed one machine at our

<<<

 Walsum
4

mill in Germany in 2013. In 2015, we stopped providing financial support to the Walsum mill and it is no longer part of the operations of the Group. In total, we have reduced production capacity by approximately 60% since December

<<<

 31, 2005, from 6.9 million tons to 2.8 million tons as of September 30, 2015. These actions have significantly reduced our cost base. We have also reduced our fixed costs through headcount reductions and have increased our capital efficiency

<<<

 through the disposal of non-core assets, certain less competitive operations and mills outside of our core geographical regions of Europe and Australasia. These include two mills in South Korea, two mills in China, one mill in Brazil, one mill

<<<

 in Chile, one mill in the Netherlands and one mill in Thailand.
In response to structural changes in demand and in order to seize a market opportunity within magazine paper, we have also converted production capacity from newsprint to magazine

<<<

 paper. Following a NOK 500 million (60 million) investment, our Boyer mill in Australia now produces coated mechanical paper on one converted machine, making it the sole domestic magazine paper producer in Australasia. Our ability to switch

<<<

 production has enabled us to better adapt to changes in demand between different paper products by reducing production capacity for products that have experienced reduced demand, and by increasing production capacity for products with increased

<<<

 demand. In addition, we have invested more than NOK 200 million (25 million) in a TMP plant at our Saugbrugs mill, resulting in significant reduction of consumption of energy and pulp at that mill, which has also enabled us to expand our product

<<<

 portfolio to new uncoated mechanical segments.
We continue to focus on the implementation of a variety of improvement initiatives and the identification of new sources of efficiency. We achieved total cost reductions of NOK 341 million (39

<<<

 million) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Some of our most successful ongoing improvement initiatives include operational enhancements at our Saugbrugs, Bruck and Boyer mills as a result of reduced usage of chemicals and improved

<<<

 energy balance.
Challenging operating environment
In recent years, we have continued to maintain strong cash flows prior to reflecting our debt service payments despite industry revenue declines. We have been able to bolster our cash flow generation

<<<

 by reducing our fixed cost base, improving our management of working capital and selectively selling assets. However, we believe that 2015 was challenging due to the adverse operating environments in both our European and Australasian businesses

<<<

. In Europe, there was a fight for market share in publication paper during the first half of the year, which resulted in a price decrease for newsprint of approximately 15%. We believe that the current price level is at the cash cost level

<<<

 for efficient mills. In Australasia, the combination of decreasing domestic demand and historically low export prices to Asia put our operations under pressure. We believe that impact to be significantly stronger because we are the sole producer

<<<

 in the region. As a result of this challenging operating environment, EBITDA and cash flow generated in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are significantly below our expectations.
Our strong focus on working capital management has resulted

<<<

 in an efficient and industry leading working capital management system, as reflected by our reduced inventories and improved control of accounts receivable.
In recent years, maintenance capital expenditure requirements at our mills have remained

<<<

 relatively low and manageable, with capital expenditures of NOK 150 million (20 million), NOK 151 million (19 million) and NOK 173 million (21 million) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. For the nine months

<<<

 ended September 30, 2015, we spent NOK 85 million (10 million) on maintenance capital expenditures. Recently announced growth initiatives, commented on below, are all project financed with development capital expenditures linked to these new

<<<

 businesses beyond the traditional publication paper business. We expect the operating environment to improve in 2016 with the consensus within the industry that prices for publication paper should increase in Europe. We believe that the supply

<<<

 and demand balance should stabilize due to recent capacity closures. Additionally, we expect better margin opportunities to occur in Europe, which would lead to decreasing exportations from Europe to Asia and support the trend in price increase

<<<

, benefitting the Australasian business. However, we do not believe that these improvements will be enough to balance the lost EBITDA contribution and cash generation from 2015.
Execution-focused management team with relevant experience
We believe

<<<

 that our senior corporate management team has the relevant experience to execute our strategy. Each of our regional mill management teams has an average tenure of 15 years with the Group. We believe that we benefit from the experience and industry

<<<

 know-how of our senior corporate management team and the production know-how of the respective mill management teams, who have relevant experience in the global publication paper industry. In addition to experience in the publication paper

<<<

 industry globally, our corporate management team also has management experience from other commodities businesses. We maintain a flat and lean decentralized decision-making structure, which allows our local management teams to manage their

<<<

 day-to-day operations based on local market dynamics.

Strategy
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Defend our leadingposition in the publication paper industry in Europe and Australasia
With a leading position in both newsprint

<<<

 and magazine paper in Europe and Australasia, we are well-positioned to leverage our existing customer relationships. We believe we are a stable supplier of newsprint in Europe where we sell our products to some of the region's leading paper

<<<

 consumers, including financial printing operations, drop advertisement producers such as Bertelsmann Group (MOHN Media Mohndruck GmbH), Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG and Carrefour Procurement International and major news publishers such as News International

<<<

 Ltd. in the United Kingdom, RCS Media Group SpA in Italy, Axel Springer SE in Germany and Schibsted Trykk Oslo AS in Norway. We are the sole producer of publication paper in Australia and New Zealand and we are working to diversify our revenues

<<<

. We aim to be the producer of choice for quality newsprint and magazine paper products in the European and Australasian markets, while maintaining and improving our position as a high-quality producer with a competitive cost base.
Continueproactive

<<<

 capacity management
We will continue to manage our production capacity in order to adjust to market developments proactively. In Europe, we have strategically reduced or converted capacity over the past four years, including, for example, our

<<<

 Follum, Parenco and Walsum operations, to increase the operating margins of our continuing business. We will continue to monitor our asset base and market developments and consider measures to address our less competitive capacity. In Australasia

<<<

, in line with the closure of one machine at our Tasman mill in 2013 and the conversion of one of our two newsprint machines at the Boyer mill in Australia to magazine paper production in 2014, we will continue our business system optimization

<<<

 in order to produce products where it is most cost-effective to do so.
Continue to strengthen business model
We will continue to invest in improvements to reduce costs and improve efficiency and quality. In Europe, we plan to invest in higher

<<<

 quality grades of newsprint products and focus on the extension of our product portfolio into selected new end use segments within publication paper as well as improve production mix quality at our Skogn mill. In Australasia, we are benefiting

<<<

 from our recent diversification to magazine paper production and we will leverage our new cost competitive position in magazine paper and our well-developed logistical system to serve export markets for newsprint.
Take advantage o f new growth

<<<

 opportunities beyondpublication paper
In 2015, we launched several growth initiatives beyond our traditional publication paper business. These initiatives broaden the operations of the Group, from renewable energy in the form of biogas to wood

<<<

 pellets to tissue paper. We expect that these initiatives could have a run rate timeframe of approximately 4 years and could potentially contribute to up to NOK 300 million of annual EBITDA in the future.
Biogas
We believe we have the ability

<<<

 to build biogas facilities at all mills, leveraging biowaste from the paper production to renewable energy. An onsite biogas facility brings two types of economic benefits, a new biogas revenue stream and reduced paper production costs. Biogas

<<<

 is a renewable alternative to fossil fuels, which forms part of the carbon solution. We believe biogas technology to have significant potentials in improving urban air quality.
We initiated the construction of our first biogas facility at the

<<<

 Saugbrugs mill in Norway. We expect the total investment to be approximately NOK 150 million, of which NOK 52 million is financed through a grant. We expect the biogas facility to start generating revenue at the end of 2016 and to be at full

<<<

 run-rate contribution in 2017, with a run rate payback time for the net investment of approximately 4 years. We are currently considering replicating this project at other mills.
Woodpellets in New Zealand
We acquired Nature's Flame, the market

<<<

 leader for wood pellets in New Zealand. The market share of Nature's Flame in New Zealand is approximately 70%.
We intend to increase the annual production of Nature's Flame from 20,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes by the end of 2016. If this initiative

<<<

 proves to be successful, we will consider expanding the pellets production to our Tasman site,
6

leveraging waste fibre for renewable pellets revenue. We believe our location in New Zealand will enable us to enter the Asian market.
Entering

<<<

 the tissue paper market
We intend to convert the newsprint site at Brack in Austria to a tissue paper production. Norske Skog Brack recently entered into a joint-venture with Roto-cart, an Italian producer and distributor of tissue paper. Roto

<<<

-cart was founded in 1981 and is headquartered in Veneto, North-Italy, which has annual revenue of approximately EUR 50 million in 2014. Our exposure to the market risk and capital expenditures into the joint-venture is limited by the jointventure

<<<

 agreement for Norske Skog.
The total investment for the tissue conversion project is approximately EUR 80 million, financed at 75% with debt and at 25% with equity and has an anticipated run-rate payback time of approximately 5 years.
Bio-chemicals

<<<

 in Tasmania
In November 2015, we entered into a joint-venture agreement with Circa Group to manufacture and market a range of sustainable chemicals. The joint-venture involves the construction of a demonstration plant at the Boyer mill in Tasmania

<<<

, which will produce Cyrene, a non-toxic alternative to existing solvents used in pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries. The AU$ 6.6 million plant will produce approximately 50 tonnes per annum of Cyrene and is due to be functioning on

<<<

 a full rate within 12 months. The plant is partly financed through a grant of AU$ 1.5 million from the Tasmanian Government.
Address capital structure and achieve stability
We intend to address a portion of our immediate and medium-term debt

<<<

 maturities through the implementation of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. We will strive to reduce leverage in the medium-term as part of our efforts to achieve a long-term sustainable capital structure. By reducing the amount

<<<

 of operational earnings committed to debt repayment obligations, we hope to achieve greater operational stability that will provide a basis for future sustained profitability.
Carefully evaluatefuture consolidation opportunities
We believe

<<<

 our industry needs to continue to better align capacity with demand, which we anticipate will be realized by industry consolidation in Europe. We will continue to evaluate selective opportunities to enhance our strategic and cost positions

<<<

. However, any potential transaction will be structured with a focus on credit enhancement via careful evaluation of appropriate financing sources and terms.
Recent Developments
On October 15, 2015, we repaid the remaining U.S.$24 million (NOK

<<<

 202 million) principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2015.
Trading Update
Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2015 are not yet finalized. The information in this section is based on preliminary

<<<

 internal management accounts and includes estimates and assumptions, and is subject to change as the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements are finalized, as further described herein. Undue reliance should not be placed on the information

<<<

 in this section.
This information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our management, and has not been audited, reviewed or verified; no procedures have been completed by our auditors with respect thereto, and undue reliance

<<<

 should not be placed thereon. This information is subject to confirmation in the Group's unaudited quarterly report for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and in the Group's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and reportfor the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2015.
Profit & Loss
The price for publication paper, i.e. newsprint and magazine paper, remained relatively stable throughout the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the previous quarter. Seasonality and the restart of one

<<<

 machine at Skogn in Norway, following a prolonged summer stop, supported volumes in Europe to a certain degree. Volumes in Australasia were relatively flat. The weak Norwegian krone, which also continued to depreciate slightly in the fourth

<<<

 quarter of 2015,
7

contributed to a somewhat positive translation effect on gross operating earnings. Fixed and variable costs were relatively stable from the third quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2015.
Cashflow
Cash flow from operations

<<<

 benefited from a seasonal release of working capital, however this effect was largely offset by interest payments in the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2015 were somewhat higher than in in the previous quarter, reflecting

<<<

 progress on growth initiatives. The redemption of the remaining Senior Notes due 2015 in October 2015 lowered cash balances.
Balance sheet
Reflecting the cash flow, cash balances were lower at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared

<<<

 to the end of the previous quarter. Cash balances include restricted cash of approximately NOK 250 million. A liquidity buffer of around NOK 200 million is prudent to allow for daily volatility in working capital. Foreign denominated debt,

<<<

 when translated to NOK for accounting purposes, increased somewhat due to the continued depreciation of NOK. Property, plant and equipment increased to a lesser degree with the weaker NOK, resulting in a negative effect on equity. The level

<<<

 of gross operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 was lower than the interest and depreciation charges through the Profit & Loss, further contributing to a reduction in Group equity.
Outlook
The market balance for newsprint and magazine

<<<

 paper in Europe has improved following capacity closures in the industry. This has led to improved pricing, supported by high operating rates across all publication paper grades. Favorable energy costs for our European mills and efficiency

<<<

 measures at all mills are expected to reduce variable costs by 2-3% per tonne in 2016. Fixed costs initiatives continue at all mills. Both Europe and Asia experienced newsprint prices at cash cost levels last year. The Asian export market for

<<<

 newsprint is of increasing importance to the Group, as the domestic market in Australasia has declined. The growth initiatives announced last year are expected to start to contribute to gross operating earnings this year and we estimate will

<<<

 reach full run-rate within a timeframe of 3-4 years.

The Transactions
Background to November Exchange Offer
During

<<<

 the first quarter of 2015, we undertook a series of transactions in order to address the short term and medium term maturities of the Parent's then outstanding debt securities, which matured (or will mature) in October 2015, June 2016, June

<<<

 2017 and 2033. The transactions were comprised of the issuance of 290 million of Senior Secured Notes and exchange offers for the Parent's existing notes for new 2021 Senior Subordinated Notes and 2023 Senior Subordinated Notes and cash. The

<<<

 exchange offers and related transactions completed in February 2015 resulted in an improved capital structure of the Group through enhanced liquidity, deleveraging and an extended maturity profile.
During 2015, we experienced challenging trading

<<<

 conditions mainly due to depressed publication paper prices and volumes in Europe and challenging export markets in Asia, and EBITDA, net cash flow from operating activities and equity declined as compared to the prior year period. The Board

<<<

 of Directors of the Parent has monitored the situation and recognizes that financial leverage remains high and that the Group requires improved profitability and/or changes in its capital structure. The Board of Directors has focused on improving

<<<

 profitability and cash flow and has been considering several options to address the upcoming debt maturities and the high financial leverage of the Group. As part of the consideration of such options, we engaged in discussions with certain

<<<

 material holders of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes (GSO and Cyrus) and their financial and legal advisors concerning the terms of a possible refinancing transaction in respect of some or all of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes. On October

<<<

 27, 2015, we announced that that the discussions with such material holders of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes were concluded without any agreement
8

being reached. We also engaged in preliminary discussions with the financial and legal

<<<

 advisors to an ad hoc group of certain holders of the Senior Secured Notes regarding a comprehensive balance sheet restructuring of the Group.

On November 17, 2015, the Parent commenced exchange offers and consent solicitations in respect

<<<

 of the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes (the "November Exchange Offer"). At the time of commencement, the November Exchange Offer did not receive a sufficient level of support from holders of the 2016 Notes or 2017 Notes. The Parent extended the expiration

<<<

 date of the November Exchange Offer on December 11, 2015 to January 12, 2016. The November Exchange Offer was formally terminated on January 5, 2016.

December 2015 Stock Exchange Notices and Requestfor EGM

On December 4, 2015, notices were

<<<

 provided to the Oslo Stock Exchange to the effect that GSO had acquired shareholdings in the Parent equivalent to 10.59% of the issued shares and voting rights of the Parent, and that Cyrus had acquired shareholdings in the Parent equivalent

<<<

 to 0.89% of the issued shares and voting rights of the Parent. As described in the Parent's filing with the Oslo Stock Exchange on December 8, 2015, GSO and Cyrus subsequently requested that an extraordinary general meeting ("EGM") of the Parent

<<<

 be held, at which the following agenda items are included:



election of new members of the Parent's Board of Directors to replace the current Board members Ms.

Karin Bing Orgland, Ms. Siri Beate Hatlen and Mr. Ole Enger;



election of

<<<

 new members of the Election and Remuneration Committee to replace certain of the current

members; and



GSO's and Cyrus's contemplated refinancing proposal for the Parent.

The Parent's Board of Directors have called for an EGM to be held

<<<

 on January 6, 2016. The EGM notice noted that, as of the date of such notice, GSO and Cyrus have not proposed new members of the Board of Directors or proposals with respect to changes in the composition of the Election and Remuneration Committee

<<<

. On January 5, 2016, the Parent announced via a notice to the Oslo stock exchange that GSO and Cyrus had proposed that Ms. Joanne Owen and Mr. Nils Ingemund Hoff be elected as new members of the Parent's Board of Directors to replace Ms. Karin

<<<

 Bing Orgland and Mr. Ole Enger but that no changes be made to the Election and Remuneration Committee of the Parent. The Election and Remuneration Committee of the Parent has in its recommendation to the EGM recommended that Ms. Joanne Owen

<<<

 and Mr. Nils Ingemund Hoff be elected as new members of the Parent's Board of Directors.

Recommencement ofDiscussions with Material Holders o f 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes

During December 2015, we recommenced discussions with GSO and Cyrus

<<<

, in their capacity as material holders of the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes, and their financial and legal advisors and reached an agreement with such holders, which agreement was approved by the Parent's Board of Directors on December 21, 201

<<<

5, and a public announcement as to such agreement was made on December 22, 2015.

Summary o f Agreement with GSO and Cyrus

The agreement among the Parent and GSO and Cyrus includes the following key provisions:

 the Parent will commence exchange

<<<

 offers and consent solicitations that contain the terms of the Exchange Offers set forth in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum, including (among other things) the terms of the Exchange Offer Consideration offered to the

<<<

 Holders of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes, the minimum tender conditions and the 2017 Notes Proposals, and GSO and Cyrus each will tender their holdings of the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes on that basis;

 Holders that elect to participate

<<<

 in the Exchange Offers will be able to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, for an aggregate amount of 15.0 million of Ordinary Shares of the Parent at a price of NOK 2.24 per Ordinary Share, and that GSO and Cyrus will subscribe for their pro rata

<<<

 portions of the Ordinary Shares on that basis;

 GSO and Cyrus will purchase for cash the Parent's treasury holdings of 12.9 million nominal amount of the 2016 Notes and 5.6 million nominal amount of the 2017 Notes for an aggregate purchase

<<<

 price of 10.3 million, and will tender such purchased 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes into the Exchange Offers;

 the Parent will reimburse up to 1.5 million of reasonable and properly documented expenses in connection with the transactions; and

<<<


9

 GSO and Cyrus will provide a new NOK 250 million receivables facility (the "Norwegian Receivables Facility") to Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS and Norske Skog Skogn AS and other parties as agreed, which facility will be secured by a first-priority

<<<

 pledge over Norwegian receivables, the proceeds of which will be used to repay and discharge the existing Sparebank 1 Gruppen Finans AS facility and to repay the fees and expenses associated with such new facility, including a commitment fee

<<<

 of 1.0%.
The agreement further provides that the commitments of GSO and Cyrus under the agreement are several and not joint and are subject to satisfactory definitive documentation. The commitments of GSO and Cyrus will continue until implementation

<<<

 of the transactions contemplated by the agreement (or the abandonment of the transactions by the Parent).
The agreement further acknowledges that the Parent, following the completion of the Transactions, in order to address the dilution effects

<<<

 of the Transactions, will commence a repair offering of Ordinary Shares to existing shareholders of the Parent at a price of NOK 2.24 per Ordinary Share (the "Repair Offering").
The Exchange Offers and Transactions
As of September 30, 2015

<<<

, without giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (but giving effect to the repayment of the 2015 Notes on October 15, 2015), we had total interest bearing liabilities of NOK 8,946 million, including 108 million (NOK 1,033 million) of 2

<<<

016 Notes and 212 million (NOK 2,024 million) of 2017 Notes. As of December 31, 2015, our cash balances included restricted cash of approximately NOK 250 million. A liquidity buffer of around NOK 200 million is prudent to allow for daily volatility

<<<

 in working capital.
There is a very significant risk that, absent substantial material improvement in short and medium term trading conditions, our existing cash balances, together with our anticipated cash flow from operations and other capital

<<<

 resources, will be insufficient to allow us to satisfy the payments of principal on the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes as they become due in June 2016 and June 2017, respectively. Our ability to satisfy these obligations may accordingly depend

<<<

, in part, on the successful completion of the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations, or one or more alternative transactions, such as raising additional secured debt or making asset sales. However, the quantum of any new secured debt

<<<

 and the permitted use of proceeds from the issuance of such debt or from asset sales is significantly constrained by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes.
In addition, the financial performance of the Group over

<<<

 recent quarters and the currency effects on the total financial leverage of the Group from the continuing weakening of the Norwegian kroner have together reduced the total equity of the Group from NOK 1,497 million as of December 31, 2014 

<<<

(restated) to NOK 547 million as of September 30, 2015. There is a significant risk that the equity level of the Group will continue to be reduced by the net financial results of the Group, further depreciation of the Norwegian kroner and other

<<<

 negative one-off items. This situation is sought to be partly addressed by the expected effects of the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations, which if completed, should materially improve the equity position of the Group.
In the Exchange

<<<

 Offers, the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer are offering the Eligible Holders of the Parent's 2016 Notes to exchange their 2016 Notes for newly issued QSF Exchange Notes, Exchange Notes due 2019 and Perpetual Notes and Equity Subscription

<<<

 Rights and to Eligible Holders of the 2017 Notes to exchange their 2017 Notes for newly issued QSF Exchange Notes, Exchange Notes due 2026 and Perpetual Notes and Equity Subscription Rights, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Exchange Offer

<<<

. Pursuant to the Consent Solicitations, the Parent is soliciting consents from the Eligible Holders of the Parent's outstanding 2017 Notes to amend the maturity, principal amount and interest rate on the 2017 Notes and to permit the redemption

<<<

 or mandatory exchange of the 2017 Notes for other debt securities.
There is a minimum tender condition of 90% of the 2016 Notes and 75% of the 2017 Notes in the Exchange Offers. The Parent reserves the right to decrease or waive the minimum

<<<

 tender condition in its sole discretion without providing for an extension of the duration of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations.
Under the agreement among GSO, Cyrus and the Parent, GSO and Cyrus have committed to tender their holdings

<<<

 of the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, which holdings (together with the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes that are being acquired from the Parent) represent 37.6% and 68.2%, respectively, of the outstanding

<<<

 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes. If the minimum tender conditions are not satisfied (or waived) and the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are not completed, the very material uncertainty surrounding the Group's liquidity position in 2016

<<<

 and 2017 may cause and/or require the officers and directors of subsidiary operating companies in the Group to consider whether they can continue to provide monies to the Parent, which the Parent relies upon to satisfy its liabilities. The

<<<

 Parent's independent auditors may also issue an audit opinion on our December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements on a qualified basis as to their assumption of our ability to continue as a going concern, which could raise concerns among

<<<

 our trade creditors and other finance providers. In such circumstances, the Parent
10

would be forced to consider any and all available options, which may include a non-consensual comprehensive balance sheet restructuring of the Parent. There

<<<

 can be no assurance that the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations will be completed, or as to the aggregate principal amount of each series of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that will be exchanged for Exchange Notes.
We believe that the successful

<<<

 completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations will protect value for all of our stakeholders and position us to take advantage of a cyclical improvement in the publication paper industry cycle. The completion will also provide

<<<

 protection of the position of holders of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes. After the completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, we will still have significant cash interest expense, high financial leverage and significant

<<<

 debt repayment obligations due in 2019.

RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information contained in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum, you should carefully consider the following

<<<

 risk factors in evaluating an investment in the Exchange Notes and the Ordinary Shares. Any o f the risks described below, or additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a significant or material

<<<

 adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results o f operations or prospects and result in a corresponding decline in the market price o f the Exchange Notes and the Ordinary Shares. You could lose all or a substantial part o fyour

<<<

 investment.
This exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materiallyfrom those anticipated in such forward-looking statements

<<<

 as a result o f certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum. See "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements".
Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry

<<<


We have a history o f losses, and we may not be profitable or generate sufficient cash flow to meet our liquidity needs in thefuture.
We have had a history of losses. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we generated losses

<<<

 of NOK 1,504 million, NOK 1,844 million and NOK 2,781 million, respectively. In addition, in recent periods, our operating cash flows and available capital resources have not been sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including working capital

<<<

, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash flow from operating activities was NOK 200 million and NOK (867) million, respectively. A failure

<<<

 to become profitable or to generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our liquidity needs could adversely affect our ability to sustain operations, obtain additional funding, meet our debt service obligations, including with respect to

<<<

 the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes and Exchange Notes, or continue as a going concern.
During recent years, we experienced weaker demand for our products due to depressed economic conditions, decreased circulation levels of newspapers and magazines

<<<

 and other trends in end-user preferences, which adversely impacted our results of operations and liquidity. Our future liquidity could be negatively impacted by many factors including, but not limited to, continued overcapacity in the paper

<<<

 industry, decreased prices for our finished products, reduced demand for publication paper, increased prices for raw materials, exchange rate fluctuations or other factors. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources

<<<

 are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional financing, restructure or refinance

<<<

 all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, including the Notes, or forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses.
The availability, timing and terms of any alternative sources of liquidity will likely depend

<<<

 upon our financial condition and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that any future financing will be available to us at any given time or as to the reasonableness of the terms on which any future financing

<<<

 may be available. We cannot assure you that our current expectations of cash flow from operations (which will depend on numerous future factors and conditions, many of which are beyond our control) will be accurate. Such cash flow projections

<<<

 are merely estimates of future events and actual events will probably vary from current estimates, possibly materially.
The publication paper industry has undergone significantfundamental changes in the last decade. This has resulted in periods

<<<

 of substantial overcapacity and intense competition among paper manufacturers, principally associated with declining demand in certain marketsfor publication paper, especially newsprint, which is likely to continue.
Demand for our products

<<<

 is influenced by global economic trends, demographic trends, circulation levels of newspapers and magazines, technological developments, trends in end-user preferences and inventory levels maintained by our customers.
The rise of the internet

<<<

 and other electronic media, including as a replacement for print-based advertising, has fundamentally changed the market environment for our products and has resulted in a decline in demand in certain markets for publication paper. The decrease

<<<

 in demand for publication paper is structural, rather than cyclical, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. In particular, levels of demand for newsprint in certain historically significant markets, such as Europe, Australasia

<<<

 and the United States, have declined and are likely to continue to decline. Newspaper and magazine publishers have developed electronic platforms and channels as supplements to their printed versions and significant advertising volumes have

<<<

 moved from printed to electronic media. These trends have had, and are likely to continue to have in the years to come, an adverse effect on the circulation levels of traditional print media and consequently on consumption of publication paper

<<<

.
30

In the 1990s, we and many of our competitors made significant investments in Europe to increase production capacity. In the last decade, large amounts of new capacity have been built in Asia, especially in China, to cover the expected

<<<

 demand growth in that region. This has reduced the need for imports from North America and Europe. In the same period, the demand for newsprint has declined significantly in North America, and to some extent in Europe, due to the reasons mentioned

<<<

 above, which has led to excess capacity in both these regions.
Imbalance between production capacity and demand remains our and the industry's largest challenge, as this imbalance has contributed to significant downward pressure on selling

<<<

 prices for our products. While we are a significant participant in most of the markets in which we compete, neither our actions nor those of any one industry participant have more than a small influence on changes in product prices. Despite

<<<

 recent industry-wide efforts to consolidate, however, overcapacity is likely to continue to have an effect in the future. Any decline in demand and corresponding excess capacity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of

<<<

 operations and financial condition.
We have a substantial amount o f indebtedness maturing in 2016 and 2017 and we may not have adequate liquidity to satisfy our debt obligations as they become due.
As of September 30, 2015, without giving

<<<

 pro forma effect to the Transactions (but giving effect to the repayment of the 2015 Notes on October 15, 2015), we had total interest bearing liabilities of NOK 8,946 million, including 108 million (NOK 1,033 million) of 2016 Notes and 21

<<<

2 million (NOK 2,024 million) of 2017 Notes. As of December 31, 2015, our cash balances included restricted cash of approximately NOK 250 million. A liquidity buffer of around NOK 200 million is prudent to allow for daily volatility in working

<<<

 capital.
There is a very significant risk that, absent substantial material improvement in short and medium term trading conditions, our existing cash balances, together with our anticipated cash flow from operations and other capital resources

<<<

, will be insufficient to allow us to satisfy the payments of principal on the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes as they become due in June 2016 and June 2017, respectively. Our ability to satisfy these obligations may accordingly depend, in part

<<<

, on the successful completion of the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations, or one or more alternative transactions, such as raising additional secured debt or making asset sales. However, the quantum of any new secured debt and the

<<<

 permitted use of proceeds from the issuance of such debt or from asset sales is significantly constrained by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes.
In addition, the financial performance of the Group over the recent

<<<

 quarters and the currency effects on the total financial leverage of the Group from the continuing weakening of the Norwegian kroner have together reduced the total equity of the Group from NOK 1,497 million as of December 31, 2014 (restated

<<<

) to NOK 547 million as of September 30, 2015. There is a significant risk that the equity level of the Group will continue to be reduced by the net financial results of the Group, further depreciation of the Norwegian kroner and other negative

<<<

 one-off items. This situation is sought to be partly addressed by the expected effects of the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations, which if completed, should materially improve the equity position of the Group.
In the Exchange Offers

<<<

, the Parent is offering the Eligible Holders of the Parent's Relevant 2016 Notes to exchange their 2016 Notes for newly issued QSF Exchange Notes, Exchange Notes due 2019 and Perpetual Notes and Equity Subscription Rights and to Eligible Holders

<<<

 of the 2017 Notes for newly issued QSF Exchange Notes, Exchange Notes due 2026 and Perpetual Notes and Equity Subscription Rights, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Exchange Offer. Pursuant to the Consent Solicitations, the Parent is soliciting

<<<

 consents from the Eligible Holders of the Parent's outstanding 2017 Notes to amend the maturity, principal amount and interest rate on the 2017 Notes and to permit the redemption or mandatory exchange of the 2017 Notes for other debt securities

<<<

.
There is a minimum tender condition of 90% of the 2016 Notes and 75% of the 2017 Notes in the Exchange Offers. The Parent reserves the right to decrease or waive the minimum tender condition in its sole discretion without providing for an

<<<

 extension of the duration of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations.
Under the agreement among GSO, Cyrus and the Parent, GSO and Cyrus have committed to tender their holdings of the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes in the Exchange Offers and

<<<

 Consent Solicitations, which holdings (together with the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes that are being acquired from the Parent) represent 37.6% and 68.2% respectively, of the outstanding 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes. If the minimum tender conditions

<<<

 are not satisfied (or waived) and the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are not completed, the very material uncertainty surrounding the Group's liquidity position in 2016 and 2017 may cause and/or require the officers and directors

<<<

 of subsidiary operating companies in the Group to consider whether they can continue to provide monies to the Parent, which the Parent relies upon to satisfy its liabilities. The Parent's independent auditors may also issue an audit opinion

<<<

 on our December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements on a qualified basis as to their assumption of our ability to continue as a going concern, which could raise concerns among our trade creditors and other finance providers. In such

<<<

 circumstances, the Parent would be forced to consider any and all available options, which may include a non-consensual comprehensive balance sheet restructuring of the Parent. There can be no assurance that the Exchange Offers and Consent

<<<

 Solicitations will be
31

completed, or as to the aggregate principal amount of each series of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that will be exchanged for Exchange Notes.
We believe that the successful completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent

<<<

 Solicitations will protect value for all of our stakeholders and position us to take advantage of a cyclical improvement in the publication paper industry cycle. The completion will also provide protection of the position of holders of the

<<<

 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes. Even after the completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, however, we will still have significant cash interest expense, high financial leverage and significant debt repayment obligations due

<<<

 in 2019.
Even if we successfully consummate the Exchange Offers or an alternative liability management transaction, our remaining indebtedness may impair ourfinancial condition and our ability to grow and compete, and we may incur additional

<<<

 debt.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2015, without giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (but giving effect to the repayment of the 2015 Notes on October 15, 2015), we had total interest-bearing liabilities

<<<

 of NOK 9,148 million. Our high leverage has important consequences for our financial condition, including:
 requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our debt and reducing

<<<

 our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, the execution of our business strategy, acquisitions, operations and general corporate requirements;
 making it more difficult to refinance our obligations as

<<<

 they come due;
 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, competitive and industry conditions;
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, the execution of our

<<<

 business strategy, acquisitions, operations and other general corporate requirements;
 limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make divestitures;
 limiting our ability to retain key employees or attract new employees

<<<

;
 limiting our ability to retain and attract customers;
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and
 limiting our ability to receive trade credit from our suppliers

<<<

 or otherwise placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other less-leveraged competitors.
Our existing indebtedness contains, certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests

<<<

. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could cause an acceleration of all of our debts.
We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness

<<<

 in the future pursuant to the terms of the instruments governing our debt securities. If new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could intensify.
We will require

<<<

 a significant amount o f cash to service our indebtedness, including the Exchange Notes, fund working capital and make planned capital expenditures.
Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Exchange Notes

<<<

, and to fund working capital and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future and our ability to borrow under our other lending facilities, to the extent of available borrowings. This, to a certain

<<<

 extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If adverse regional and national economic conditions persist, worsen or fail to improve significantly, we

<<<

 could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in wholesale and consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants

<<<

 and borrowing limitations that we are subject to under our indebtedness.
If our future cash flows and other capital resources (including availability under our factoring and securitization facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations

<<<

 as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:
32

reduce or delay our capital expenditures;
 close or curtail operations at our mills and further reduce our sales and overhead staffs;
 dispose of assets;
 obtain additional

<<<

 debt or equity capital; or
 refinance all or a portion of our debt.
We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us, or otherwise in an amount sufficient

<<<

 to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to access alternative sources of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations

<<<

 and financial condition.
The demandfor ourproducts is affected by cyclicalfactors.
Much of the demand for our products is generated directly or indirectly by advertising, whether by newsprint publishers, printers, direct mail campaigns, magazine

<<<

 publishers or other ultimate end-users of paper. When the economy slows, advertising and promotional expenditures are generally reduced and our customers ' demand for our products declines. These factors are beyond our control and we are therefore

<<<

 vulnerable to declines in economic conditions, such as during the recent global economic downturn.
Pricesfor ourfinished products mayfluctuate significantly.
The markets for publication paper products such as newsprint and magazine paper are

<<<

 highly cyclical and have historically experienced significant price volatility. Because publication paper is a commodity-like product, there are generally few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer. This has resulted in strong price

<<<

 competition for our products, with price determined by supply relative to demand. Levels of supply and demand may differ between products and geographic regions.
Supply of publication paper is principally affected by production and capacity

<<<

 levels. In recent years, there has been significant excess capacity in the market, which resulted from fundamental changes that have taken place in our industry. In response to this, in common with other industry participants, we have reduced

<<<

 industry capacity through the idling and closure of paper machines and mills. However, to avoid the idling or closing of mills, some producers may choose to continue to operate at a loss for a period of time, which could prolong weak pricing

<<<

 environments due to over-supply in the industry as a whole. Therefore, despite capacity reductions, there is a risk that supply will continue to exceed demand, which may cause prices to fall and change the pattern of imports and exports between

<<<

 regions. Excess capacity can exacerbate price decreases in periods of declining demand and can delay price increases that would otherwise result from any future increase in demand.
Demand for publication paper fluctuates and is affected by

<<<

 general economic conditions and increased use of the internet and other electronic media, each of which impact end-user demand for publication paper as described above. In light of the potential for further structural decline in demand resulting

<<<

 from, for example, ever greater usage of the internet to deliver media content, we may not be able to increase or even maintain current price levels for our products.
Like other paper companies, we have limited influence over the timing and

<<<

 extent of price changes for our products, which are influenced by many factors outside our control and can often be volatile. In addition, despite our cost control initiatives, fixed costs continue to comprise a significant proportion of our

<<<

 cost structure. Therefore, we have only very limited scope to further reduce our fixed costs in response to downward pressure on selling prices for our products. Any further significant downturn in the price levels for our products would have

<<<

 a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Prices for our raw materials are volatile and there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain our raw materials, in particular energy, wood

<<<

 and recoveredpaper, at prices that will enable us to sell our products profitably, or at all.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the main raw materials used by us in the production of our products are energy, wood and recovered paper

<<<

, which represent 21%, 13% and 9% of our total operating expenses, respectively. Since 2011, our results of operations have been negatively affected by an increase in the costs (on the basis of costs per ton of publication paper) for each of

<<<

 these inputs.
33

Our global manufacturing operations utilize electricity, geothermal energy, natural gas and the burning of waste wood for which we generally rely on third- party suppliers. As a result, we are susceptible to price volatility

<<<

, in particular in energy and recovered paper prices. In addition, we may from time to time be subject to unpredictable supplies of our raw materials, and no assurance can be given that we would be able to source alternative supplies of raw

<<<

 materials in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. Our contracts with energy suppliers can vary as to price, quantity and duration. Our energy costs are also affected by various market factors, including supply and demand balance, fuel

<<<

 prices and local and national regulatory decisions.
While we have long-term contracts in place for a portion of our wood needs, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient supplies of wood, recovered paper or other raw materials

<<<

 for all of our production needs, or that prices will remain at levels that will enable us to sell our finished products profitably, or at all.
Unlike many of our competitors, we are not vertically integrated. Our competitors that have greater

<<<

 degrees of vertical integration may have more secure access to, and better control of the cost of, raw materials. Producers with a greater degree of vertical integration may therefore have a competitive advantage over us. This is particularly

<<<

 significant in our magazine segment, as the manufacturing process is primarily based on the use of wood fiber and chemical pulp, each of which is particularly susceptible to significant price volatility.
The price for our products is determined

<<<

 primarily based on demand and we may therefore be unable, in the short term or at all, to pass on to our customers any increases in the cost of our raw materials. Any sustained increase in the cost of energy, wood or recovered paper prices

<<<

 would reduce our gross profit margins, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Industry consolidation in Europe constitutes a key element of our business strategy. Failure to

<<<

 consummate consolidation transactions or to implement any o f our business strategies successfully or unexpected developments in thepublication paper industry could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
We may

<<<

 be unable to implement our strategies or achieve the anticipated results of such strategies. Our strategies are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control

<<<

. In particular, we believe industry consolidation in Europe is necessary in order to better align capacity with demand and we are actively seeking to achieve this through acquisitions, alliances and/or strategic partnerships with other industry

<<<

 participants. The success of this strategy depends on numerous factors, such as the participation of our competitors in such industry consolidation, our financial resources and those of our competitors, our ability to obtain adequate financing

<<<

 on acceptable terms, our ability to successfully evaluate and consummate any such consolidation transactions, the impact on our financial condition of any additional debt incurred in connection with any such consolidation transactions and the

<<<

 realization of the expected benefits of any such consolidation transactions when expected or to the extent anticipated. In addition, our strategy has been developed based on our predictions and assumptions as to future developments in the publication

<<<

 paper industry, which judgments are based on the experience of our management team. If we are unable to implement our key business strategies, or if the publication paper industry develops in a manner that we have not anticipated, it may have

<<<

 a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may not recognize the expected benefits ofplanned or completed investments or operational changes.
As part of our ongoing operations, we regularly

<<<

 invest in new operations or adopt new operating policies intended to reduce costs or increase operating margins; however, there can be no assurance that such investments or operations will generate such intended benefits. For example, in 2

<<<

012 we completed the construction of a geothermal power plant at our Tasman mill in New Zealand with the intention of reducing the cost of electricity for the site's operations and selling excess energy in local markets. As a result of declines

<<<

 in the cost of energy in New Zealand in 2012 and 2013, the spot price of electricity fell below those expected when the investment in the geothermal plant was approved and subsequent sales of excess energy from the geothermal plant's operations

<<<

 have been below initially budgeted expectations. Similarly, in the first quarter of 2014, we completed the conversion of one of our Boyer mill's two newsprint machines to magazine paper production. During the first half of 2014, the converted

<<<

 magazine paper machine did not reach the intended productivity levels expected under the project's anticipated timeline. Any future investments in capital expenditures, entry into joint ventures and/or adoption of new operating procedures may

<<<

 not generate the intended benefits and the failure to realize such benefits may have a material negative effect on the results of our operations.
Our business and results of operations are affected by many general economicfactors.
Our business

<<<

 and results of operations are affected by many general economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. We are particularly vulnerable to economic conditions in Europe as our European segment operations

<<<

 represented 70% of our operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
34

2015. If economic conditions in the markets in which we operate worsen, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

<<<

 in 2016 and beyond.
The marketsfor publication paper products are highly competitive, and some o f our competitors have advantages that may adversely affect our ability to compete with them.
We compete against a large number of publication

<<<

 paper producers located around the world. Some of these companies benefit from vertical integration, product diversity, greater financial resources or economies of scale, or operate mills that are lower-cost producers of paper products than

<<<

 our mills, making them less vulnerable to adverse fluctuations in any one sector than we are. Furthermore, our competitors may be better positioned financially or operationally than we are to take advantage of consolidation opportunities which

<<<

 may arise, and there can be no assurances that a failure to take advantage of such opportunities on our behalf would not make us less competitive.
In order to remain competitive, we must also respond to changes in consumer preferences. For

<<<

 example, paper companies have historically responded to changes in consumer preferences by improving existing or developing new paper qualities, such as paper with increased recovered paper content, increased brightness or lower basis weight

<<<

, and by increasing production of higher margin light-weight coated and super-calendared magazine paper. A failure to respond to such changes in consumer preferences could cause us to become less competitive.
Increased competition could result

<<<

 in a loss of market share, increased expenditures or reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, competitive market conditions may result in an inability to increase the selling

<<<

 prices of our products sufficiently or in time to offset the effects of increased costs without losing market share and aggressive pricing by competitors may force us to decrease prices in an attempt to maintain market share. In addition, our

<<<

 competitors may have a greater ability to reduce the price of their products, whether as a result of lower costs of production, greater economies of scale, greater financial resources or otherwise, which would further affect our ability to

<<<

 compete. Our business is concentrated in certain geographic regions and along product lines. Changes that would affect our key markets and/or products may have a disproportionate impact on our business relative to competitors that are more

<<<

 vertically-integrated and have greater geographic and product diversification.
An inability to remain competitive could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our manufacturing operations

<<<

 are subject to operational risks.
The production of paper involves a significant degree of uncertainty and risk, both in terms of operational performance and costs. The effect of this degree of uncertainty and risk on our operations can be

<<<

 difficult to predict and is often influenced by factors outside our control. Our operations are subject to hazards and risks normally associated with industrial activity and exploitation of natural resources, such as:
 scarcity of natural

<<<

 resources required for production, such as wood and water;
 environmental hazards, including the discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals;
 requirements as to environmental remediation and the costs associated with decommissioning of

<<<

 machines or mills that we temporarily idle or permanently close;
 industrial accidents, electricity stoppages and equipment or asset failures;
 labor disputes;
 difficulty or delays in obtaining necessary permits and authorizations (e.g

<<<

. environmental, land use and fire safety permits); and
 seismic activity and the impact of natural disasters, including earthquakes, droughts, floods and/or extreme weather conditions which may prevent access to our cold-weather ports.
The

<<<

 occurrence of such events may result in the death of, or personal injury to, mill workers, the loss of production equipment, damage to production facilities, the closure of mills, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations in production

<<<

, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs and potential legal liabilities. For example, in February 2011, a fire at the pulp production system supplying our Saugbrugs mill in Norway caused extensive damage to the

<<<

 electrical cable system, forcing us to stop all operations of three paper machines,
35

delaying the return to normal production levels until January 2012. The occurrence of such events in the future could have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 our business, results of operations or financial condition.
We are subject to a wide variety o f environmental laws and regulations, which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to incur significant liabilities.
We operate

<<<

 in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. We are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing, among

<<<

 other things, water use, air emissions, wood procurement, use of recycled materials, energy sources, the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the operation of our mills (including the noise impact

<<<

 of our operations), the protection of the environment, wildlife and natural resources and the remediation of environmental contamination. Our operations require us to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental

<<<

 permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenge. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability

<<<

 to continue our operations.
The risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in industrial operations, including the publication paper industry. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or

<<<

 permit requirements may result in civil or criminal fines, penalties or enforcement actions. These may include regulatory or judicial orders curtailing our operations or requiring corrective or remedial measures, such as the installation of

<<<

 pollution control equipment, any of which could require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to incur significant liabilities or curtail certain of our manufacturing operations.
Further, the adoption of increasingly strict environmental

<<<

 laws, regulations and enforcement policies, particularly those relating to air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, has resulted in the past, and could

<<<

 result in the future, in substantially increased compliance costs and liabilities. For example, if laws are introduced that require us to change, or impose other requirements in relation to, the sources of energy we currently use, it may result

<<<

 in a material increase in our operating expenses and require us to make significant capital expenditures aimed at ensuring compliance with such laws, regulations and policies. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur significant

<<<

 additional environmental costs and liabilities in relation to businesses or assets we may acquire, including liabilities incurred by such business or assets before we acquire them.
It is difficult to predict the future development of such laws

<<<

 and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or their impact on our future earnings and operations, and such laws and regulations may require capital expenditures to ensure compliance. Increased regulatory, environmental and similar

<<<

 costs and changes to operational requirements could reduce our profit margins and earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in the political or economic conditions

<<<

 in the countries in which we operate, or in which our products are sold, could adversely affect our results o f operations and our business decisions.
We manufacture products in various countries in Europe and Australasia and participate in

<<<

 a joint-venture in Malaysia. We sell products throughout the world. Our operations can, from time to time, attract heightened political scrutiny, as a result, for example, of the environmental impact of the use of wood to make paper. The economic

<<<

 and political climate of each country has a significant impact on our costs and the prices of, and demand for, our products. We conduct a substantial part of our operations in Europe, particularly in Norway and France, and as such, any adverse

<<<

 developments in those countries in particular or Europe in general, such as increases in tariffs or export duties, increases in tax or permit payments relating to transportation, changes in regulation, scarcity in, or increased prices for,

<<<

 raw materials, a negative political environment or an economic downturn, can affect the cost of manufacturing and distributing our products and can affect the prices of our products and our sales volume. Any of these factors could adversely

<<<

 affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are exposed to credit and liquidity risks with respect to the receipt and timing ofpaymentsfrom our customers and liquidity risks with respect to thepayment terms offered

<<<

 by our suppliers.
We finance the acquisition of raw materials and the production and delivery of publication paper from working capital, credit lines or other financing sources. While we have implemented receivables financings in Europe and

<<<

 Australasia, our ability to fund our working capital requirements at any time will depend upon our future operating performance, our ability to generate sufficient cash and the receipt and timing of payments from our customers and the payment

<<<

 terms offered by our suppliers.
36

We face the risk of non-payment by our customers in connection with the sale of our products, particularly in respect of sales to commercial printers who have been particularly affected by the economic downturn

<<<

 and significant decreases in the demand for commercial printing in recent years. A continued weakness in the general economic environment may result in increased payment defaults by our customers and increased losses. As of December 31, 20

<<<

14, we had NOK 1,058 million of accounts receivable, of which NOK 92 million was over three months past due. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had charges of NOK 103 million, NOK 90 million and NOK 80 million to our provision

<<<

 for bad debts.
Our financial position has been negatively affected by the global economic downturn, which made financing more difficult to obtain for us and for our customers and suppliers. We may experience irregular or insufficient cash flows

<<<

 that may make it difficult for us to meet our obligations to suppliers and customers in a timely manner or at all. Due to liquidity concerns, suppliers may require payments in advance from us on the purchase of certain raw materials. Delayed

<<<

 payment or non-payment by our customers, or requests for payment in advance by our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
Exchange ratefluctuations could adversely impact

<<<

 ourfinancial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to the impact of exchange rates in several ways which are significant to our financial condition and results of operations. We are exposed to transaction risks as a result of

<<<

 differences in the currency mix of our operating revenue, on the one hand, and our operating costs, on the other hand. For example, the majority of the operating revenue from the sales of publication paper from our Norwegian operations is denominated

<<<

 in Euros and UK pounds sterling, while a significant portion of the operating costs for such operations are denominated in Norwegian kroner. These imbalances have negatively impacted the results of such operations and some of our other operations

<<<

 in recent periods as a result of the relative strength of the Norwegian kroner. We hedge some of this risk by contracting for certain expenses in Euros instead of local currencies, in particular for energy costs; however, we have terminated

<<<

 our currency hedging arrangements and there can be no assurance that our existing contractual arrangements will fully protect us from transactional exchange rate risk or that we will be able to enter into future hedging arrangements on commercially

<<<

 reasonable terms.
We are also subject to translation risk because our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Norwegian kroner but only a portion of our revenues, assets and liabilities are located in Norway or denominated in Norwegian

<<<

 kroner. Exchange rate fluctuations could have a significant adverse effect on our income statement and balance sheet when we translate those revenues, assets and liabilities into Norwegian kroner at the exchange rate prevailing on the date

<<<

 of our Consolidated Financial Statements (or, in the case of revenues, at the period average).
Additionally, currency fluctuations influence publication paper prices and trade flows and can also affect the relative competitive position of a

<<<

 paper mill, and there is a risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our competitiveness relative to our competitors in different countries. There can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
A downgrade in our debt ratings could result in increased interest and other financial expenses related to future borrowings, and couldfurther restrict our access to additional

<<<

 capital or trade credit.
Standard and Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service maintain credit ratings for us. Each of these ratings is currently below investment grade. Any decision by these or other ratings agencies to downgrade

<<<

 such ratings in the future could result in increased interest and other financial expenses relating to our future borrowings, and could restrict our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, any further downgrade could

<<<

 restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials.
Our Australasian business is dependent on a limited number o f customers, the loss o f any one o f which could have an adverse

<<<

 effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In Australasia, which contributed 30% of our operating revenue and 52% of our gross operating earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we derive most of our

<<<

 revenues from only a few customers. While we currently have long-term contracts in place with these customers, contracts will fall due for renewal in 2020. If we or the customers do not perform our respective obligations under such contracts

<<<

, or if we lose any one of these customers without finding alternative sources of demand, our business reputation in the region would be significantly degraded. In such a situation, we may find it difficult to attract new customers or retain

<<<

 those customers with which we currently have relationships. Additionally, both our customers and our suppliers of raw materials may demand more restrictive terms or shorter contract durations in their contracts with our Australasian businesses

<<<

. Any of these results, singularly or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
37

The value of our energy contracts, and consequently our results of operations, mayfluctuate

<<<

 significantly.
We have entered into long-term energy supply contracts in most countries. In the event that the amount of energy we require for our operations in those geographies is less than that contracted for (for example, due to capacity

<<<

 reductions), we may resell the excess energy on the market and we may, from time to time, amend or sell our rights and obligations under such energy contracts. Under IFRS, the entire value of energy contracts that provide for excess supply

<<<

 must be valued at fair value. Contracts for energy that are for our own use do not have to be valued at fair value, but if they include embedded derivatives, the imbedded derivatives must be valued at fair value. Fair value is calculated as

<<<

 the present value of cash flows over the life of the contract. Changes in fair value are recorded as income or expense, as applicable, in our income statement. Since the fair value is based on market expectations for energy prices and currency

<<<

 exchange rates, interest rates, price indices and the discount rate used, additional volatility is introduced in our results. Due to volatility in the market price of energy and certain other relevant parameters, it is impossible to predict

<<<

 what the impact will be on our results of operations or financial condition from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in the value of our energy contracts will not have a material adverse effect on our business

<<<

, results of operations and financial condition.
We depend on thirdpartiesfor certain transportation services.
We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of our products to our customers and transportation of our raw materials to

<<<

 us, in particular by truck and train. If any third-party transportation provider fails to deliver our products in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell them at full value. Similarly, if any transportation provider fails to deliver raw materials

<<<

 to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions, strikes or other events. Any failure of a third-party transportation

<<<

 provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition

<<<

, our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis could be adversely affected by the lack of adequate availability of transportation services, especially rail capacity, whether because of work stoppages or otherwise. Furthermore, increases

<<<

 in the cost of our transportation services, including as a result of rising fuel costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risingpostal costs could weaken demandfor ourpaper

<<<

 products.
A significant portion of paper is used in magazines, catalogs and other promotional mailings. Many of these materials are distributed through the mail. Future increases in the cost of postage could reduce the frequency of mailings

<<<

, reduce the number of pages in magazine and advertising materials and/or cause catalogue and magazine publishers to use alternate methods to distribute their materials. Any of the foregoing could decrease the demand for our products, which

<<<

 could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain appropriately skilled employees.
Our future success depends

<<<

 on our ability to continue to attract and retain appropriately skilled employees for the operation and development of our business. This challenge is particularly acute as we are operating in a mature and declining industry. Any failure to

<<<

 retain and attract key members of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Labor disputes may cause work stoppages, strikes and disruptions

<<<

.
We continually evaluate the cost efficiency of our mills, and we may make selective closures of our less efficient mills as part of a reduction in our aggregate capacity serving regions where we anticipate limited future growth. We have in

<<<

 the past implemented, and may again in the future implement, changes and restructuring measures, including mill and machine shutdowns, divestitures (such as Norske Skog Korea and Norske Skog Steti in the Czech Republic) and workforce reductions

<<<

 in order to decrease production costs, improve efficiency at our production facilities, exploit synergies and cope with the demands of a changing market. Substantially all of our employees involved in production are members of labor unions

<<<

, and these measures or other reasons could result in labor disputes, strikes or disruptions which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Post-retirementplan obligations may affect

<<<

 ourfinancial condition.
We maintain defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans for certain retired employees. As of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our net pension obligations (net unfunded pension plans less net

<<<

 partly or fully funded pension plans) were NOK 820 million, NOK 692 million and NOK 618 million, respectively. Funding requirements for these plans are dependent on various factors, including interest rates, asset returns, regulatory requirements

<<<

 for funding purposes and changes to plan benefits. In 2015, we were required to contribute approximately
38

NOK 40 million towards the underfunded liability of the defined benefit pension plans. In June of 2015, approximately NOK 500 million

<<<

 of our net pension obligations were taken over by the administrator following our exclusion of the Walsum Mill. Although we expect to continue to make contributions to fund post-retirement plan obligations and to meet legal funding obligations

<<<

 for the defined benefit pension plan, no assurance can be made that the underfunded liability under these plans will not be materially adverse to us in the future.
The availability and cost o f insurance cover can vary considerablyfrom year

<<<

 to year as a result o f events beyond our control, and this can result in our paying higher premiums and periodically being unable to maintain the levels or types of insurance carried.
Although the insurance market has been stable for the last

<<<

 several years, it remains cyclical and catastrophic events can change the state of the insurance market, leading to sudden and unexpected increases in premiums and deductibles and unavailability of coverage due to reasons unrelated to our business

<<<

. We have in the past experienced catastrophic events such as the fire at our Saugbrugs mill in February 2011, and if similar events were to occur in the future, such incidents could, along with other factors, cause our insurance premiums to

<<<

 increase or our insurance policies to be modified. For example, following the fire at our Saugbrugs mill in February 2011, our insurance policy was modified and we are now only covered for business interruptions lasting 11 days or more and

<<<

 up to 18 months. In addition, turmoil and volatility in the global financial markets may adversely affect the insurance market, which could result in some of the insurers in our insurance portfolio being unable to pay their share of claims

<<<

. We are unable to assure you that actual losses will not exceed our insurance coverage or that such excess will not be material.
We are, and may in thefuture be, a party to legal or regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims which could

<<<

 have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.
We are, and may in the future be, a party to legal or regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims arising out of the conduct of our business

<<<

. The industry in which we operate has been, and may in the future continue to be, subject to heightened scrutiny in relation to environmental matters and the market in which we operate, which increases the likelihood that we are subject to

<<<

 legal proceedings and investigations. Any claims asserted against us may harm our reputation, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any legal proceedings exceed our insurance coverage

<<<

, or if the conclusions of any legal proceedings or investigations impose requirements in relation to our business, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to the

<<<

 Exchange Notes
To service the Exchange Notes and our other indebtedness, we will require a significant amount o f cash, and our ability to generate cash will depend on manyfactors beyond our control.
Our ability to make payments on the Exchange

<<<

 Notes and our other indebtedness, refinance our indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements will partly depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This ability is, to a certain extent, subject

<<<

 to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. See "--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry'".
We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from

<<<

 operations, that we will realize anticipated operating improvements on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service and repay the Exchange Notes and our other indebtedness or to

<<<

 fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments

<<<

 or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that any refinancing, debt restructuring or additional financing would be possible, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds

<<<

 realized from those sales would be sufficient to generate sufficient cash flows, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms.
I f we default under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations

<<<

.
Certain of our existing indebtedness contains a number of significant covenants that restrict our corporate activities, including our ability to:
 incur additional debt;
 make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions

<<<

;
 create liens;
39

 sell assets, and apply the proceeds from asset sales for certain purposes;
 in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, enter into arrangements that restrict dividends or other payments to us;
 engage in transactions

<<<

 with affiliates;
 create unrestricted subsidiaries; and
 consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions

<<<

 may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, this would also result in an event of default under certain of our other existing

<<<

 indebtedness. If any of our material financing arrangements were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Exchange Notes and our other debt.
I f the Parent's subsidiaries are unable to make distributions and other

<<<

 payments to the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer, the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer may be unable to pay amounts due on the Exchange Notes.
The Unsecured Exchange Notes will be obligations of the Parent only, and not of any

<<<

 of its subsidiaries. Similarly, the QSF Exchange Notes will be non-recourse obligations of the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer and senior obligations of Parent only, and not any of their subsidiaries. Each of the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes

<<<

 Issuer is a holding company that does not directly conduct any business operations. The Parent's and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer's only material assets are the capital stock of their respective subsidiaries, many of which are themselves holding

<<<

 companies. Because the Group's operations are conducted substantially by operating subsidiaries, the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer each expects to obtain the funds required to make payments of principal or interest on the Exchange

<<<

 Notes through cash dividends, distributions or other transfers from its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Parent's and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer's ability to make payments of principal or interest on the Exchange Notes will be contingent upon

<<<

 the Parent's subsidiaries generating sufficient cash, or the availability of cash under the Parent's cash pooling facility and from other intracompany funding arrangements, or from other payments. The Parent's subsidiaries may not be able to

<<<

 make distributions to the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer. The terms of certain of our outstanding debt contain a number of significant covenants that restrict the Parent's ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other

<<<

 things, pay dividends or make other distributions, make capital expenditures, incur additional debt and grant guarantees. In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by the Parent's subsidiaries to the

<<<

 Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in

<<<

 which the subsidiaries operate.
Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the Exchange Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether

<<<

 by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, the Exchange Notes. The Exchange Notes are not guaranteed by any of the Parent's and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer's subsidiaries

<<<

. Any right that the Parent or the QSF Exchange Note Issuer has to receive any assets of any of its operating subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent right of Holders of Exchange Notes to

<<<

 realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, may be effectively subordinated to the claims of such subsidiaries' creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiaries.
Claims of our secured creditors will have

<<<

 priority with respect to their security over the claims o f unsecured creditors, to the extent of the value o f the assets securing such indebtedness.
Claims of the Parent's secured creditors will have priority with respect to the assets securing

<<<

 their indebtedness over the claims of the Parent's unsecured creditors. None of the Parent's assets that secure the Senior Secured Notes will secure the Exchange Notes. Accordingly, the Exchange Notes (including the Parent's guarantee of the

<<<

 QSF Exchange Notes) will be effectively subordinated to the Parent's obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any other secured indebtedness or obligations of the Parent to the extent of the value of such assets. In the event of any foreclosure

<<<

, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the Parent, Holders of such secured indebtedness or obligations of the Parent will have prior claims to the assets of the

<<<

 Parent that constitute their collateral. The Holders of the Exchange Notes (other than the Perpetual Notes) will participate ratably with all Holders of the unsecured indebtedness of the Parent (other than indebtedness to which the Exchange

<<<

 Notes have been expressly subordinated), and, potentially with all of their other general creditors, based upon the
40

respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the remaining assets of the Parent (if any). In the event that any

<<<

 of the secured indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor becomes due or the creditors thereunder proceed against the operating assets that secured such indebtedness, the assets remaining after repayment of that secured indebtedness may not be

<<<

 sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Parent. As a result, Holders of Exchange Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness of the Parent and may not receive payment in respect of the Exchange Notes

.
The QSF Exchange Notes are non-recourse obligations of the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer and none of the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer's assets that secure the Senior Secured Notes will secure the QSF Exchange Notes. The QSF Exchange Notes Issuer

<<<

 is the issuer of the Senior Secured Notes and a Guarantor of the Senior Subordinated Notes.
As of September 30, 2015, after giving effect to the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations (assuming 100% participation therein) we would have

<<<

 had an aggregate principal amount of NOK 4,409 million of secured financial liabilities (excluding derivative liabilities) outstanding. We will be permitted to borrow substantial additional indebtedness, including senior debt, in the future

<<<

, under the terms of our indebtedness.
Enforcement of the Exchange Notes and other indebtedness across multiplejurisdictions may be difficult.
The Unsecured Exchange Notes will be issued by the Parent, which is incorporated under the laws of

<<<

 Norway. The QSF Exchange Notes will be issued by the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer and guaranteed by the Parent, which each are incorporated under the laws of Norway, and the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral will include assets located in Norway and

<<<

 France. The Parent and certain of its subsidiaries (including the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer) are obligors under certain other indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes, and these subsidiaries are organized

<<<

 under the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often

<<<

 result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors' rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer

<<<

 and such subsidiaries may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors' rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post- petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application

<<<

 of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions' law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce or to realize any recovery under the Exchange Notes. See "Service o fProcess

<<<

 and Enforcement o f Certain Liabilities".
You may not be able to sell your Exchange Notes.
There is no existing market for the Exchange Notes. We do not intend to apply for a listing for the Exchange Notes and no broker-dealer has informed

<<<

 us that they intend to make a market in the Exchange Notes. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in our financial performance or in the markets where we operate may adversely affect the liquidity

<<<

 of the trading market in these Exchange Notes and the market price quoted for these Exchange Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will actually develop for these Exchange Notes.
Historically, the markets for

<<<

 non-investment grade debt such as the Exchange Notes have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in their prices. The market, if any, for the Exchange Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any disruptions

<<<

 may have an adverse effect on the Holders of the Exchange Notes.
The transfer o f Exchange Notes is restricted.
The Exchange Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any jurisdiction and unless so registered

<<<

, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See "Offer and Distribution Restrictions--Notice to U.S. Investors

<<<

'" and "Transfer Restrictions".
The interests of our shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests o fHolders of the Exchange Notes.
The interests of our various shareholders could conflict with the interests of the Holders of the Exchange

<<<

 Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. As described in "Summary-- The Transactions'", two of our shareholders, GSO and Cyrus, have significant holdings of our existing indebtedness

<<<

 and will be providing the new Norwegian Receivables Facility. Additionally, the terms of each series of Exchange Notes permit the modification of such series, including with respect to fundamental terms, with the consent of a simple majority

<<<

 of the Holders of such series of Exchange Notes and GSO and Cyrus may hold controlling majorities of various series of the Exchange Notes following the completion of the Exchange Offers due to their current holdings of 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes

<<<

 and their commitments under the Transactions. Our shareholders could cause us to pursue acquisitions,
41

divestitures, financings, debt restructurings, dividend distributions or other transactions (subject to the limitations contained in

<<<

 our indebtedness) that, in their judgment, could enhance or preserve their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to Holders of the Exchange Notes. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our shareholders will

<<<

 not sell all or any part of their respective shareholdings at any time or that they will not look to reduce their holding by means of a sale to a strategic investor, an equity offering or otherwise.
Investors mayfaceforeign exchange risks by

<<<

 investing in the Exchange Notes.
The Exchange Notes will be denominated and payable in Euros. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than Euros, an investment in the Exchange Notes will entail foreign

<<<

 exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of Euros relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic

<<<

, political and other factors over which we have no control. The depreciation of Euros against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Exchange

<<<

 Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Exchange Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments.
You may not be

<<<

 able to recover in civilproceedingsfor U.S. securities law violations.
Each of the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer is incorporated outside the United States. All of the directors and executive officers of the Parent and the QSF Exchange

<<<

 Notes Issuer are non-residents of the United States. You may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer. In addition, as most of the

<<<

 assets of the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer and those of their respective directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts

<<<

 predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Furthermore, we have been informed that it is questionable whether a court in Norway would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings

<<<

 were commenced in such court predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.
Norwegian insolvency laws and the laws o f other jurisdictions may provide you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law.
In the event that the Parent or

<<<

 any of its subsidiaries, including the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer and the Norwegian and French subsidiaries that will grant the pledges over the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral, experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with

<<<

 certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict

<<<

 with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, preferences, transactions at an undervalue and transactions defrauding creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability

<<<

 to obtain or claim interest following the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction's

<<<

 laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Exchange Notes in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.
Risks Related to the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral
The QSF Exchange Notes will

<<<

 be secured only to the extent of the value o f the assets that have been granted as securityfor the QSF Exchange Notes.
If there is an event of default under the QSF Exchange Notes, the holders of the QSF Exchange Notes will be secured only

<<<

 to the extent of the value of the assets underlying their Security Interest. The QSF Exchange Notes Collateral is comprised of the receivables and inventory related to our Saugbrugs and Skogn mills in Norway, the inventory related to our Golbey

<<<

 mill in France and certain bank accounts. The security interests in respect of Norwegian receivables are junior in ranking to the security interests in respect of the Norwegian Receivables Facility. The QSF Exchange Notes are not secured by

<<<

, among other things, the assets that secure the Senior Secured Notes or the property and assets of our paper mills in Australia, Austria or New Zealand. The QSF Exchange Notes are non-recourse obligations of the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer, and

<<<

 other than for the guarantee of the QSF Exchange Notes by the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral, are non-recourse to the Group. In addition, certain of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral is subject to release in the event of a refinancing

<<<

 of the Norwegian Receivables Facility. As a result, in the event of an enforcement of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral, holders of the QSF Exchange Notes may receive less than the amount of their claims under the QSF Exchange Notes.
42

The

<<<

 value o f the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral securing the QSF Exchange Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the QSF Exchange Notes.
No appraisal of the value of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral has been made in connection

<<<

 with the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, and the fair market value of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions

<<<

, working capital movements and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the QSF Exchange

<<<

 Notes Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, some of the assets that comprise the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market

<<<

 value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral

<<<

 may not be sufficient to repay the obligations under the QSF Exchange Notes.
To the extent that other first-priority or second-priority security interests (as applicable), pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the QSF Exchange Notes and

<<<

 other rights encumber any of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral securing the QSF Exchange Notes, the holders of those liens and rights may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral that could

<<<

 adversely affect the value of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral.
Certain o f the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral will bejunior-ranking in right

<<<

 ofpayment tofirst-ranking security.
The security interests in respect of the Norwegian receivables that will secure the QSF Exchange Notes will be junior in ranking to the security interests in respect of the Norwegian Receivables Facility

<<<

. The security agent for the QSF Exchange Notes will not be permitted to take enforcement action in respect of such junior-ranking security interests without the consent of the agent under the Norwegian Receivables Facility.
There may not be

<<<

 sufficient QSF Exchange Notes Collateral to repay the obligations under the QSF Exchange Notes and any additional indebtedness that would be secured on the same basis as the QSF Exchange Notes. In addition, liquidating the QSF Exchange Notes

<<<

 Collateral securing the QSF Exchange Notes may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under the QSF Exchange Notes after also satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with pari passu liens. If the proceeds

<<<

 of any sale of QSF Exchange Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the QSF Exchange Notes, the holders of the QSF Exchange Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral

<<<

) would have only a senior unsecured claim.
The security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders o f the QSF Exchange Notes.
The security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes and the security

<<<

 documents in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the QSF Exchange Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the QSF Exchange Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security

<<<

 Agent for the QSF Exchange Notes, and any future obligations permitted to be secured by the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral under the QSF Exchange Notes. The QSF Exchange Notes and the security documents will provide that only the Security Agent

<<<

 has the right to enforce the security documents. As a consequence, holders of the QSF Exchange Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral

<<<

 securing the QSF Exchange Notes, except through the Security Agent for the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral.
In certain jurisdictions in which security interests are being provided in favor of the QSF Exchange Notes, including France, due to the

<<<

 laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the relevant security documents will provide for the creation of "parallel debt" obligations in favor of the Security

<<<

 Agent, and the security interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt only, and may not directly secure the obligations under the QSF Exchange Notes. The parallel debt construct has not been tested in court in certain of these

<<<

 jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral created under the parallel debt construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the QSF Exchange Notes will not receive any

<<<

 proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral. See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability o f the Parent Guarantee and the Security Interests'".
The Parent and certain o f its subsidiaries

<<<

 will have control over the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could reduce thepool of assets securing the QSF Exchange Notes.
The security documents allow the Group to remain in possession of, retain exclusive

<<<

 control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral securing the QSF Exchange Notes. The Parent and its relevant subsidiaries may, among other things, without any release or consent

<<<

 by the agent or
43

Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral such as selling or otherwise disposing of QSF Exchange Notes Collateral and making cash payments, including repayments

<<<

 of indebtedness.
There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge o f the QSF Exchange Notes under which the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released automatically, without your consent or the

<<<

 agent or the Security Agent obtaining yourfurther consent.
Under a variety of circumstances, the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral securing the QSF Exchange Notes will be released automatically, including:
 a sale, transfer or other disposal of

<<<

 such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the terms of the QSF Exchange Notes;
 with the consent of holders of a majority of the QSF Exchange Notes;
 with respect to the pledge of the Norwegian receivables and the bank account

<<<

 pledge, upon the refinancing of the Norwegian Receivables Facility; and
 in connection with an enforcement action permitted under the security documents.
It may be difficult to realize the value of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral.
The QSF

<<<

 Exchange Notes Collateral securing the QSF Exchange Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the QSF Exchange Notes. The existence of any such exceptions, defects

<<<

, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral securing the QSF Exchange Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such QSF Exchange Notes Collateral

<<<

. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain

<<<

 jurisdictions.
The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent

<<<

 of a thirdparty to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate

<<<

 a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral may significantly decrease.
The laws of certain jurisdictions do not generally

<<<

 permit an appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the occurrence of an enforcement event and usually require the sale of the relevant collateral through a formal disposal process involving a public auction. Certain waiting periods

<<<

 and notice requirements may apply to such disposal process.
The QSF Exchange Notes Collateral is subject to casualty risks.
We intend to continue to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in accordance with our current practices

<<<

. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the QSF Exchange

<<<

 Notes Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the QSF Exchange Notes. In addition, even if there is sufficient insurance coverage, if there is a total or partial loss of

<<<

 certain QSF Exchange Notes Collateral, there may be significant delays in obtaining replacement QSF Exchange Notes Collateral.
The rights o f holders in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the security interests in

<<<

 QSF Exchange Notes Collateral not beingperfected or beingjunior security interests.
In some jurisdictions, applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority

<<<

 retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the Security Interest, such as filings, registration or the publication of notices. The security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes may not be perfected

<<<

, and their priority may not be retained, with respect to the obligations under the QSF Exchange Notes, if the Security Agent and/or the grantor of the Security Interest does not take the actions necessary to perfect any of the security interests

<<<

 on, or prior to, the date that the security is granted or as otherwise required by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. In addition, applicable law in some jurisdictions requires that certain property and rights
44

acquired after the grant

<<<

 of a general security interest, such as real property or equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.
In particular, the pledge over inventory

<<<

 granted by the French subsidiary will only become enforceable (opposable) against third parties for a five year period as from registration and publication pursuant to article 2338 of the French Civil Code (Code civil) and Decree n2006-18

<<<

04 dated 23 December 2006, and thereafter only provided that registration can be renewed before the expiry of such five year period. Moreover, it should be noted that there is no public register or similar means of ascertaining that no charges

<<<

 or assignments have been created, made or perfected over those assets pledged under the French security document which relate to inventory prior to the date on which the security interests granted under the French security document have been

<<<

 created and perfected.
The grant of the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral to secure the QSF Exchange Notes might be challenged or voidable in an insolvency proceeding.
The grant of Collateral may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee

<<<

, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant

<<<

, or if the grant or permits certain parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant subordination had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified "clawback" period following

<<<

 the grant. See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability o f the Parent Guarantee and the Security Interests".
Risks Related to the Ordinary Shares
Theprice of the Ordinary Shares couldfluctuate significantly.
The trading volume and price

<<<

 of the Ordinary Shares has fluctuated significantly in the past, and could fluctuate significantly in the future. Securities markets in general have been volatile in the past. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the Ordinary Shares

<<<

' price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the Ordinary Shares include, for example, changes in the Group's actual or projected results of operations or those of its competitors, changes in earnings projections or failure

<<<

 to meet investors' and analysts' earnings expectations, investors' evaluations of the success and effects of the strategy described in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum, as well as the evaluation of the related risks,

<<<

 changes in general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, changes in shareholders and other factors. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies. Those changes may occur

<<<

 without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of the Ordinary Shares may therefore fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with the Group, and these fluctuations may materially affect the price

<<<

 of the Ordinary Shares.
Future issuances of Ordinary Shares or other securities could dilute the holdings of shareholders and could materially affect the price of the Ordinary Shares.
In order to address the dilution effects of the Transactions

<<<

, the Parent will commence a repair offering of Ordinary Shares to existing shareholders of the Parent at a price of NOK 2.24 per Ordinary Share following the settlement of the Transactions. The Parent may in the future decide to offer additional

<<<

 Ordinary Shares or other securities in order to finance new capital intensive projects, in connection with unanticipated liabilities or expenses or for any other purposes. The Board of Directors of the Parent has authorised an increase of up

<<<

 to 50% of the Parent's outstanding shares, the maximum size authorised by law, which authorization will remain valid until the next ordinary meeting of the Board of Directors. There is no assurance the Parent will not decide to conduct further

<<<

 offerings of securities in the future. Depending on the structure of any future offering, certain existing shareholders may not have the ability to purchase additional equity securities. If the Parent raises additional funds by issuing additional

<<<

 equity securities, holdings and voting interests of existing shareholders could be diluted.
Pre-emptive rights to subscribe for Ordinary Shares in additional issuances could be unavailable to U.S. or other shareholders.
Under Norwegian law

<<<

, unless otherwise resolved at the Parent's general meeting of shareholders (the "General Meeting"), existing shareholders have pre-emptive rights to participate on the basis of their existing ownership of Ordinary Shares in the issuance of

<<<

 any new Ordinary Shares for cash consideration. Shareholders in the United States, however, could be unable to exercise any such rights to subscribe for new Ordinary Shares unless a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act is in

<<<

 effect in respect of such rights and Ordinary Shares or an exemption from the registration requirements under the U.S. Securities Act is available. Shareholders in other jurisdictions outside Norway could be similarly affected if the rights

<<<

 and the new Ordinary Shares being offered have not been registered with, or approved by, the relevant authorities in such jurisdiction. The Parent is under no obligation to file a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act or seek

<<<

 similar approvals under the laws of any other jurisdiction outside Norway in respect
45

of any such rights and Ordinary Shares, and doing so in the future could be impractical and costly. To the extent that the Parent's shareholders are not

<<<

 able to exercise their rights to subscribe for new Ordinary Shares, their proportional interests in the Parent will be diluted.
Investors could be unable to exercise their voting rightsfor Ordinary Shares registered in a nominee account.
Beneficial

<<<

 owners of the Ordinary Shares that are registered in a nominee account (such as through brokers, dealers or other third parties) could be unable to vote such Ordinary Shares unless their ownership is re-registered in their names with the VPS

<<<

 prior to any General Meeting. There is no assurance that beneficial owners of the Ordinary Shares will receive the notice of any General Meeting in time to instruct their nominees to either effect a re-registration of their Ordinary Shares

<<<

 or otherwise vote their Ordinary Shares in the manner desired by such beneficial owners.
The transfer of Ordinary Shares is subject to restrictions under the securities laws o f the United States and other jurisdictions.
The Ordinary Shares

<<<

 have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws or any other jurisdiction outside Norway and are not expected to be registered in the future. As such, the Ordinary Shares may not be offered or sold except

<<<

 pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws. In addition, there is no assurance that shareholders residing or domiciled in the United States or other countries will be

<<<

 able to participate in future capital increases or rights offerings.
The Parent's ability to pay dividends in accordance with its dividend policy or otherwise is dependent on the availability of distributable reserves and restrictions in its

<<<

 financing agreements and the Parent may be unable or unwilling to pay any dividends in thefuture.
Norwegian law provides that any declaration of dividends must be adopted by the shareholders at the General Meeting, or by the Parent's Board

<<<

 of Directors in accordance with an authorisation from the General Meeting. Dividends may only be declared to the extent that the Parent has distributable funds and the Parent's Board of Directors finds such a declaration to be prudent in consideration

<<<

 of the size, nature, scope and risks associated with the Parent's operations and the need to strengthen its liquidity and financial position. As the Parent's ability to pay dividends is dependent on the availability of distributable reserves

<<<

, it is, among other things, dependent upon receipt of dividends and other distributions of value from its subsidiaries and companies in which the Parent may invest. As a general rule, the General Meeting may not declare higher dividends than

<<<

 the Board of Directors has proposed or approved. If, for any reason, the General Meeting does not declare dividends in accordance with the above, a shareholder will, as a general rule, have no claim in respect of such non-payment, and the Parent

<<<

 will, as a general rule, have no obligation to pay any dividend in respect of the relevant period.
Investors could be unable to recover losses in civilproceedings in jurisdictions other than Norway.
The Parent is a public limited company organised

<<<

 under the laws of Norway. The majority of the current members of the Parent's Board of Directors and management reside in Norway. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process in other jurisdictions upon such

<<<

 persons or the Parent, to enforce against such persons or the Parent judgments obtained in non-Norwegian courts, or to enforce judgments on such persons or the Parent in otherjurisdictions.
Norwegian law could limit shareholders' ability to

<<<

 bring an action against the Parent.
The rights of holders of the Ordinary Shares are governed by Norwegian law and by the Articles of Association. These rights may differ from the rights of shareholders in other jurisdictions. In particular

<<<

, Norwegian law limits the circumstances under which shareholders of Norwegian companies may bring derivative actions. For example, under Norwegian law, any action brought by the Parent in respect of wrongful acts committed against the Parent

<<<

 will be prioritised over actions brought by shareholders claiming compensation in respect of such acts. In addition, it could be difficult to prevail in a claim against the Parent under, or to enforce liabilities predicated upon, securities

<<<

 laws in other jurisdictions.
Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the value o f the Ordinary Shares and any dividends paid on the Ordinary Sharesfor an investor whoseprincipal currency is not NOK.
The Ordinary Shares will be priced

<<<

 and traded in NOK on the Oslo Stock Exchange and any future payments of dividends on the Ordinary Shares will be denominated in NOK. Investors registered in the VPS whose address is outside Norway and who have not supplied the VPS with details

<<<

 of any NOK account, will, however, receive dividends by check in their local currency, as exchanged from the NOK amount distributed through the VPS. If it is not practical in the sole opinion of the Parent's VPS registrar, to issue a check

<<<

 in a local currency, a check will be issued in USD. The issuing and
46

mailing of checks will be executed in accordance with the standard procedures of Nordea Bank Norge ASA ("Nordea"), our VPS registrar bank. The exchange rate(s) that is

<<<

 applied will be Nordea's rate on the date of issuance. Exchange rate movements of NOK will therefore affect the value of these dividends and distributions for investors whose principal currency is not NOK. Further, the market value of the Ordinary

<<<

 Shares as expressed in foreign currencies will fluctuate in part as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations. This could affect the value of the Ordinary Shares and of any dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares for an investor whose principal

<<<

 currency is not NOK.
Market interest rates could influence theprice o f the Ordinary Shares.
One of the factors that could influence the price of the Ordinary Shares is its annual dividend yield, if any, as compared to yields on other financial

<<<

 instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of the Ordinary Shares.
Risks Related to the Exchange Offers
The Exchange Notes will

<<<

 be structurally subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Subordinated Notes and all of the creditors of any o f the Parent's subsidiaries.
The Exchange Notes will not be guaranteed by any subsidiaries of the Parent and the QSF Exchange

<<<

 Notes are non-recourse obligations of the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer. Such subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount due pursuant to the Exchange Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by

<<<

 dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. As a result, the Exchange Notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of any such subsidiaries, including the subsidiaries that guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes

<<<

 and the Senior Secured Notes. All obligations of the Parent's subsidiaries, including trade payables and the guarantees of the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such

<<<

 subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to the Parent.
The effects o f the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations on the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes could materially and adversely affect the 

<<<

2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes not validly tendered and accepted pursuant to the Exchange Offers.
Any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes not validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offers will remain outstanding. There is a 90% minimum acceptance condition

<<<

 for the 2016 Notes Exchange Offer and a 75% minimum acceptance condition for the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer. If the required threshold for the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation in respect of the 2017 Notes is attained, the Proposals in

<<<

 respect of the 2017 Notes will become operative, and Holders of the 2017 Notes that are not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Exchange Offers will be subject to the terms of the 2017 Notes as modified notwithstanding the fact that they

<<<

 did not tender their 2017 Notes or otherwise deliver consents.
If the Proposals in respect of the 2017 Notes become operative, the terms of the 2017 Notes will be amended to extend the maturity date to December 30, 2026, to reduce the principal

<<<

 amount of each 1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes to 100, and change the interest rate from 7.00% in cash to a combination of 3.5% in cash and 3.5% in PIK interest. The 2017 Notes Agency Agreement, as so amended, will continue to govern the

<<<

 terms of all 2017 Notes that remain outstanding after the consummation of the Exchange Offers. The Proposals in respect of the 2017 Notes will also permit the redemption or mandatory exchange of the 2017 Notes for other debt securities. The

<<<

 changes to the terms of the 2017 Notes could have a significant adverse impact on the trading price of 2017 Notes.
The Parent undertakes that if the Extraordinary Resolution in respect of the 2017 Notes is passed, then it will allow, for a

<<<

 period of 10 Business Days, any Non-Participating Holder to tender their 2017 Notes in exchange for the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer Consideration that would have been payable to such Non-Participating Holder on the Settlement Date had such Non

<<<

-Participating Holder validly tendered their 2017 Notes for exchange prior to the Expiration Deadline (but had not subscribed for Ordinary Shares). The Parent will not give effect to the 2017 Notes Proposals (other than the Maturity Extension

<<<

 which will occur on the Settlement Date) until after the settlement of any exchanges of relevant Non-Participating Holders' 2017 Notes.
Holders o f Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that are exchangedfor Exchange Notes will be subject to increased risk

<<<

 that we will be unable to repay (or refinance) the Exchange Notes when they mature.
Eligible Holders of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes are being offered Exchange Notes with a later maturity than the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes they presently hold, which

<<<

 mature in 2016 and 2017. Eligible Holders of 2016 Notes that tender their 2016 Notes will receive QSF Exchange Notes due 2026, Exchange Notes due 2019 and Perpetual Notes and Eligible Holders of 2017 Notes that tender their 2017 Notes will

<<<

 receive QSF Exchange Notes due 2026, Exchange Notes due 2026 and Perpetual Notes. The 2017 Notes of non-tendering holders will be amended in connection with the Proposals to (among other things) extend their maturity to 2026.
47

Any Relevant

<<<

 2016/2017 Notes that are not tendered in the Exchange Offers may be acquired, redeemed or repaid on terms that may be viewed as more, or less, favorable than the terms of the Exchange Notes offered in the Exchange Offers.

 Holder has its Relevant 2016/2017 Notes registered in the name of its broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee and the Holder wishes to tender such Relevant 2016/2017 Notes in the Exchange Offers, such beneficial owner

 will need to promptly contact the person in whose name its Relevant 2016/2017 Notes are registered and instruct that person to tender its Relevant 2016/2017 Notes and deliver its consent on its behalf. Beneficial owners will need to be aware

 that their broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee may establish its own earlier deadline for participation in the Exchange Offers. Accordingly, beneficial owners wishing to participate in the Exchange Offers should

 contact their broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee as soon as possible in order to determine the time by which such owner must take action in order to participate.
Similar considerations apply in respect of those

 Relevant 2016/2017 Notes and Exchange Notes for general holders of the 2016/2017 Notes, nor do we intend to do so. If you tender your Relevant 2016/2017 Notes, you may or may not receive more or as much value than if you choose to keep them

The Exchange Notes may trade at a discount to their principal amount or the trading value, redemption price or principal amount o f the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes.
Each series of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes is currently trading at a discount

<<<

 to the principal amount of such series. While the market, if any, for the Exchange Notes will depend on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and our financial condition

<<<

, performance and prospects, the Exchange Notes may trade at a discount to their principal amount and any such discount may be significant. There can be no assurance that the Exchange Notes will trade at or above the principal amount of such

<<<

 Exchange Notes in the future, or at or above the current or future trading prices of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes.
Upon consummation o f the Exchange Offers, there may be a limited or no trading marketfor the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes and marketpricesfor

<<<

 outstanding Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may decline as a result.
There are currently limited trading markets for the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes. To the extent the Exchange Offers are consummated, the aggregate principal amounts of outstanding Relevant

<<<

 2016/2017 Notes may be significantly reduced. The trading markets for any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes not tendered in the Exchange Offers that remain outstanding could become even more limited or nonexistent due to the reduction in the amount

<<<

 of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offers (and the effects of any amendments to the terms of the 2017 Notes). If the amendments contemplated by the Consent Solicitations become operative, among other

<<<

 things, the outstanding principal amount of any 2017 Notes not tendered in the Exchange Offers may be amended to be reduced by 90.0%. If trading markets for non-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes exist after the consummation of the Exchange

<<<

 Offers, such Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may trade at a discount to the price at which they would have traded if the Exchange Offers had not been consummated depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors

<<<

. The reduction in the amount of a series of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offers may also tend to make the trading prices more volatile. There can be no assurance that active markets in the non

<<<

-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes will exist or be maintained and there can be no assurance as to the prices at which the non-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may be traded. We do not intend to create or sustain a market for any Relevant 

<<<

2016/2017 Notes that remain outstanding following the consummation of the Exchange Offers.
We cannot assure Holders that existing rating agency ratingsfor the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes will be maintained.
We cannot assure Holders that, as a result

<<<

 of the Transactions or otherwise, one or more rating agencies, including Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, would not take action to downgrade or negatively comment upon their respective ratings on the

<<<

 Relevant 2016/2017 Notes. Any downgrade or negative comment would likely adversely affect the market price of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes.
Holders of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes who hold less than the applicable Minimum Offer Amount will not

<<<

 be able to exchange their Relevant 2016/2017 Notes.
A Holder who submits an Exchange Instruction for an amount of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that does not meet the applicable Minimum Offer Amount will have its Exchange Instruction rejected. Holders

<<<

 who hold a series of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that have an aggregate nominal amount less than the applicable Minimum Offer Amount must first acquire such further Relevant 2016/2017 Notes as is necessary for that Holder to be able to offer for

<<<

 exchange the applicable Minimum Offer Amount.
From time to time, the Parent may acquire Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that are not tendered or exchanged in the Exchange Offers through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender

<<<

 offers, exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as the Parent may determine (which may be on terms more or less favorable than those contemplated in the Exchange Offers).
If a Holder holds at least 228,000 of the 2

<<<

016 Notes (but less than 1,000,000) and does not acquire additional 2016 Notes to reach the Minimum Offer Amount, the Holder may nevertheless elect to participate in the 2016 Exchange Offer and receive only QSF Exchange Notes and Exchange Notes

<<<

 due 2019 at the applicable 2016 Notes Exchange Ratio (and will not receive any Perpetual Notes or any other consideration). Likewise, if a Holder holds at least 379,000 of the 2017 Notes (but less than 491,000) and does not acquire additional

<<<

 2017 Notes to reach the Minimum Offer Amount, the Holder may nevertheless elect to participate in the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer and receive only Perpetual Notes and Exchange Notes due 2026 at the applicable 2017 Notes Exchange Ratio (and will

<<<

 not receive any QSF Exchange Notes or any other consideration). In addition, Holders whose allocation of Equity Subscription Rights is less than 100,000 will not be eligible to subscribe for Ordinary Shares.

The Parent and the QSF Exchange

<<<

 Notes Issuer have no obligation to accept offers to exchange.

The Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer are not under any obligation to accept, and shall have no liability to any person for any non-acceptance of, any offer of Relevant 

<<<

2016/2017 Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers. Offers of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange may be rejected in the sole discretion of the Parent or the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer for any reason and the Parent and the QSF Exchange

<<<

 Notes Issuer are not under any obligation to Holders to furnish any reason or justification for refusing to accept an offer of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange. For example, offers of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange may be rejected

<<<

 if any of the Exchange Offers are terminated, if any of the Exchange Offers do not comply with the requirements of a particular jurisdiction or for any other reason.

The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations may not be completed and may

<<<

, subject to applicable law, be terminated or amended at the discretion o f the Parent or the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer.

Until the Parent announces whether the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer have decided to accept valid offers of

<<<

 Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange pursuant to any of the Exchange Offers, no assurance can be given that any of the Exchange Offers or any of the Consent Solicitations will be completed. In addition, subject to applicable law and as provided

<<<

 in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum, the Parent may, in its sole discretion, extend, re-open, amend or terminate any of the Exchange Offers (including, but not limited to, amendments to any of the Exchange Notes Conditions

<<<

) at any time before the announcement of whether the Exchange and Tabulation Agent will accept valid offers of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange pursuant to that Exchange Offers or whether the Parent will accept Electronic Voting Instructions

<<<

 pursuant to that Consent Solicitation.

The ability o f Holders of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes to transfer their Notes will be restricted once they submit instructions in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations.

When considering whether

<<<

 to participate in the Exchange Offers or the Consent Solicitations, Holders should take into account that restrictions on the transfer of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes by Holders will apply from the time of submission of Exchange Instructions and

<<<

/or Electronic Voting Instructions.

A Holder will, on submitting an Exchange Instruction and/or Electronic Voting Instruction, agree that its Relevant 2016/2017 Notes will be blocked in the relevant account in the relevant Clearing System from

<<<

 the date the relevant Exchange Instruction and/or Electronic Voting Instruction is submitted until the earlier of:

(i)

(A) in the case of a Holder that has offered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange in the Exchange Offers, the

time of

<<<

 settlement on the Settlement Date, or (B) in the case of a Holder that has submitted an Electronic Voting

Instruction in respect of the Consent Solicitations, with respect to the 2017 Notes, the conclusion of the Meeting

(or any adjourned

<<<

 Meeting, as applicable); or

(ii) the date of any termination of any of the Exchange Offers (including where such Relevant 2016/2017 Notes are not accepted by the Parent or the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer for exchange) or on which the relevant

<<<

 Exchange Instruction or Electronic Voting Instruction is revoked, in the circumstances in which such revocation is permitted in accordance with the corresponding procedures and on the terms and conditions established in the section "Amendment

<<<

 and Termination" of this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum.

The Parent has the right to defer the payment of interest on the Perpetual Notes which may adversely impact the marketprice of the Perpetual Notes.

The Parent may

<<<

 in its sole discretion defer the payment of interest on the Perpetual Notes, in whole or in part, by delivering deferral notices to holders. The Parent is not subject to the any limits as to the number of times the interest payments and deferred

<<<

 interest payments can be deferred. A deferred interest payment may, at the option of the Parent, be paid at any time. While the deferral of interest continues, the Parent may make payments on any instrument ranking senior to the Perpetual Notes

<<<

. Any deferral of interest is likely to have an adverse effect on the market price of the Perpetual Notes. In addition, as a result of the deferral provisions of the Perpetual Notes, the market price of the Perpetual Notes may be more volatile

<<<

 than the market price of other securities and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Parent's financial condition and results of operations.

The Perpetual Notes may be redeemed under certain circumstances which may not accord

<<<

 with the preference of the individual holders.

The Perpetual Notes may be redeemed at the specified redemption price at the option of the Parent by delivering a redemption notice to holders of the Perpetual Notes. The Perpetual Notes are also

<<<

 subject to redemption at their

50

principal amount at the option of the Parent, if the Parent experiences a change of control or upon the occurrence of certain tax events, rating events or accounting events.
The date upon which the Perpetual

<<<

 Notes are redeemed may not accord with the preference of holders. This may be disadvantageous to holders in light of market conditions or the individual circumstances of the holders. In addition, a holder may not be able to reinvest the redemption

<<<

 proceeds in comparable securities at an effective interest rate at the same level as that of the Perpetual Notes.
The Perpetual Notes are deeply subordinated obligations and there is no limit on issuing senior or pari passu obligations, which

<<<

 may adversely impact the marketprice and liquidity of the Perpetual Notes.
The Perpetual Notes are deeply subordinated obligations of the Parent, and rank junior to the Parent's other existing and future senior indebtedness. There is no restriction

<<<

 in the Perpetual Notes on the amount of indebtedness or other liabilities that the Parent may incur and which rank senior to, or pari passu with, the Perpetual Notes. The issue of any such indebtedness or other liabilities may increase the

<<<

 likelihood of a deferral of interest under the Perpetual Notes. Furthermore, the terms of such indebtedness or liabilities may include provisions resulting in the Parent being required to defer interest under the Perpetual Notes in circumstances

<<<

 where a deferral of interest is made on such indebtedness and liabilities, The issue of any such indebtedness or liabilities may also have an adverse impact on the trading price of the Perpetual Notes or the ability of holders to sell their

<<<

 Perpetual Notes.
Holders that participate in the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation are subject to income tax consequences not discussed in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum. Holders should seek advice from their

<<<

 own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Exchange Notes (or Ordinary Shares) as well as the consequences o f the exchange.
Eligible Holders of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes should be

<<<

 aware that the tender of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes, the Consent Solicitations, the issuance of the Exchange Notes and the subscription for Ordinary Shares are subject to tax consequences not discussed in this exchange offer and consent solicitation

<<<

 memorandum (other than a summary description of certain Norwegian tax matters). Tax laws are complex and will differ depending on the jurisdiction of the relevant Holder. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the tax consequences

<<<

 of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Exchange Notes (or Ordinary Shares) and the consequences of the exchange, including, but not limited to: whether the tender of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes and acceptance of Exchange Notes is

<<<

 a taxable or tax free exchange for relevant tax purposes, the holding period in, and the allocation of tax basis among, the Exchange Notes, whether the Exchange Notes are treated as debt or equity for relevant tax purposes, the tax treatment

<<<

 of interest payments with respect to the Exchange Notes, the effect of Norwegian withholding tax (if any) on payments made with respect to the Exchange Notes (or Ordinary Shares) and the availability of tax credits or deductions as a result

<<<

 of such withholding, the application of special tax rules with respect to instruments issued at a discount, the possible application of special rules relating to notes subject to certain contingencies, the ownership of instruments that pay

<<<

 in-kind and the possible recognition of income as a result of the receipt of in-kind payments, the treatment of payments of interest and principal denominated in a foreign currency, the consequences of further issues of Exchange Notes by the

<<<

 Parent, the effects of the Consent Solicitations on the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes and any reporting requirements or obligations that may arise due to ownership of the Exchange Notes or Ordinary Shares.

 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Thefollowing discussion o f ourfinancial condition and results o f operations should be read in conjunction with the information included in "Selected Historical Financial

<<<

 Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes related thereto included elsewhere in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum. The discussion includesforward-looking statements that reflect the current view o f

<<<

 management and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in any forward- looking statements as a result o ffactors discussed below and elsewhere in this exchange offer and consent solicitation

<<<

 memorandum, particularly under "Risk Factors "and "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements ".
Overview
We are a leading global publication paper company with total production capacity of 2.8 million tons at our seven mills in Europe

<<<

 and Australasia. We are one of the world's leading producers of newsprint and are a significant producer of magazine paper by production capacity. In Europe, we operate four mills in Norway, Austria and France with 2.1 million tons of publication

<<<

 paper production capacity, making us the third largest European producer of publication paper. In Australasia (which includes Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and the neighboring islands), we operate two mills in Australia and one mill in

<<<

 New Zealand with 0.7 million tons of publication paper production capacity. We also operate Australasia's sole newsprint and magazine paper mills, making us a leading provider of publication paper in the region.
Our newsprint paper products

<<<

 include standard and improved grades, while our magazine paper products comprise uncoated super-calendared paper and light-weight coated paper. The end uses of our products are mainly newspapers and magazines, but also include catalogs, inserts

<<<

/flyers, supplements, free-sheets, directories, direct mail and brochures. Our principal geographic markets for newsprint products are Europe and Australasia, while our main geographic markets for magazine paper products are Europe, Australasia

<<<

 and North America. We sell our products in these markets under well-known brands, including Nornews, Norbright, NorX, Norstar, Norcote, Norsc, Norbook, Vantage and Tasman Directory. Our customers include publishers of leading periodicals in

<<<

 Europe, Australasia and the rest of the world, and we have long-standing relationships with many of our top tier publishing clients.
Positioning Within the Industry
Overview o f Industry Trends
Significant trends affecting the paper industry

<<<

 include (i) a fundamental structural change in paper consumption as demand for global paper consumption declines and (ii) a geographic shift in production and demand from traditional markets, such as North America and Western Europe, to Asia

<<<

 and Latin America.
A long-term demand decline for paper globally has been driven principally by technological developments which are influencing economic, demographic and end-user preference trends. Alternative methods of media consumption

<<<

 that have shifted consumer preferences towards digital platforms have negatively impacted publication paper. Global overcapacity has been driven by this demand decline and exacerbated by some capacity buildup in Asia over the past decade.
To

<<<

 reduce the levels of overcapacity and address the current market imbalance, industry participants have engaged in both consolidation and capacity closures, which have resulted in substantial capacity reductions in North America, Western Europe

<<<

, Japan and other traditional markets. North America has been a first mover in consolidation and reduction of capacity over the past several years with Europe following. Both markets have become more consolidated, which has helped to address

<<<

 the overcapacity issues. North America remains a more consolidated market than Europe, except in relation to uncoated mechanical, which suggests that there is still room for consolidation in the European publication paper markets.
Our Response

<<<


As a result of the broader industry declines, we have endured a protracted period of operational losses. We have sought to address the long-term decline in publication paper demand through a series of divestments and production facility closures

<<<

 as well as diversification of our production capacity. See "--Factors Affecting Comparability-- Significant disposals or reductions in capacity". The net effect of these actions has been to reduce our production capacity by 36% from 4.4 million

<<<

 tons of annual production capacity as of December 31, 2010 to 2.8 million tons of annual production capacity as of September 30, 2015. In reducing our capacity, we have retained our operations in Europe and Australasia, which we believe benefit

<<<

 from significant intra-regional synergies, while divesting our operations in Asia and Latin America where we lacked such synergies.
57

In addition to capacity reduction, and in order to improve our operating margins, we have also made various

<<<

 investments in cost reduction initiatives and higher margin production lines at certain of our continuing operating facilities. Our renewed focus on optimizing our working capital has increased our ability to make such investments. Our working

<<<

 capital requirements have declined faster than other Group requirements since 2011. We have reduced our working capital requirements primarily through reductions in inventories and an improved control of accounts receivable.
Operating Segments

<<<


With effect from January 1, 2014, we manage and operate our business through two operating segments: Publication Paper Europe and Publication Paper Australasia. Activities of our Group that do not fall into either of the two operating segments

<<<

 are presented under Other Activities.
Europe. The Publication Paper Europe segment encompasses production and sale of newsprint and magazine paper in Europe. Our four European mills and the regional sales organization are included in the operating

<<<

 segment Publication Paper Europe.
Australasia. The Publication Paper Australasia segment encompasses production and sale of newsprint and magazine paper in Australasia. Our three mills in Australasia and the regional sales organization are

<<<

 included in the operating segment Publication Paper Australasia.
Other Activities. Activities in our Group that do not fall into either Publication Paper Europe or Publication Paper Australasia are presented under Other Activities. This includes

<<<

 mainly corporate functions and some minor real estate activities.
Eliminations. Eliminations represent intra-group eliminations. Since January 1, 2014, eliminations generally relate to intra-group services, primarily corporate headquarters

<<<

 operations. Historically, in addition to intra- group services, eliminations included sales of energy to internal parties and other activities. Eliminations items reduce both operating revenue and cost of materials.
As described under "--Factors

<<<

 Affecting Comparability--Changes in reporting segments'", we have changed our operating segments with effect from January 1, 2014.
Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Our business is affected by a number of important trends

<<<

 and factors. The most significant of these trends and factors are discussed below.
Paper prices and volumes
The primary factors affecting our results of operations are the prices and volumes of newsprint and magazine paper that we sell. For

<<<

 the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our gross operating earnings were NOK 493 million. We believe this relatively weak number resulted from a combined decrease in prices and demand decrease in Europe and the Asian export markets. According

<<<

 to RISI, prices for SC and LWC paper in Germany are 13%, 6% and 1% lower as of September 2015 compared to the prices as of the end of 2014. The price levels in 2015 are also significantly lower than forecasted by several industry sources, including

<<<

 RISI. For instance, RISI expected prices in Europe for newsprint, SC and LWC to be 1%, 3% and 4%, respectively, higher by the end of 2015 compared to the end of 2014. As of September 2015, RISI expects the selling prices for publication paper

<<<

 in Europe to be stable through the end of 2015.
Publication paper prices. The prices at which we are able to sell our newsprint and magazine paper depend mainly on the balance between supply and demand and, to a lesser extent, on the quality

<<<

 characteristics of our publication paper and the destinations and terms of delivery. Since 2011, most of our European newsprint contracts allow for price adjustment on a quarterly or semi-annually basis, which, while tying our revenues more

<<<

 closely to fluctuations in market prices for newsprint and enabling us to respond more flexibly, introduces more volatility into our results over the course of any given year. Newsprint in Australasia is generally sold under contracts with

<<<

 pricing fixed for several years. Magazine paper is typically sold under contracts with terms of up to one year with pricing adjusted on a quarterly basis.
Production capacity. During the last 15 years, digital distribution of published media

<<<

 content and advertisements has become increasingly widespread. This development has challenged the publication paper industry, which has endured a protracted structural decline in demand, the effects of which have been exacerbated by cyclical

<<<

 demand declines tied to the 2008-2009 financial crisis and its effects on subsequent global economic growth. For paper makers, it has at times been difficult to react quickly to the effects of structural and cyclical demand shortfalls, which

<<<

 has resulted in industry-wide overcapacity.
58

Volumes sold. The volumes of newsprint and magazine paper we are able to sell are mainly affected by market demand and by the inventory levels of our customers.
Market demand for newsprint and

<<<

 magazine paper. The global demand for publication paper is strongly influenced by macroeconomic factors, consumer preferences and technological changes. Contractions in the economy typically lead to reductions in advertising spending and, as

<<<

 much of the demand for our products is generated directly or indirectly by advertising, our results will fluctuate with the general state of the economy.
Consumer preferences and habits. Demand for our products is also impacted by changes in

<<<

 consumer preferences and habits. With the rise of the Internet and electronic media, the publication paper industry in North America has witnessed a structural change in demand, with a decline in demand for most parts of print media, and newspapers

<<<

 in particular. In Europe, this trend has been less pronounced, but we currently expect that publication paper demand in Europe will continue to decline gradually. To the extent that advertising by electronic media continues to represent an

<<<

 increasing share of the advertising market at the expense of print media, or if consumer preferences or more stringent environmental regulations further disfavor paper, our revenues will be impacted.
Increases in the cost o f our raw materials

<<<

 and energy
Our key raw materials are energy and fiber. Fiber is sourced as wood and as recovered paper. Input factor costs have in general been stable in recent years. This stability is a result of relatively modest input factor price volatility

<<<

 due to our contracting structure for energy and wood as well as improvements in fiber and energy consumption as a result of investments at some of our mills.
Energy. We are a producer of publication paper, which is among the most energy-intensive

<<<

 types of paper to produce. Energy is our single most important expense, and amounted to 21% of our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For this same period, 76% of our energy cost related to the purchase of electricity

<<<

, while the remainder mainly related to purchases of gas and steam used to dry paper. As of September 30, 2015, a majority of our Group-wide electricity requirements were bought under long-term contracts. As a cost of publication paper production

<<<

, our exposure to spot market energy prices is limited primarily to the European continent. See "-- Fluctuation in the value o f energy contracts " for a description of the impact of fluctuations of energy contracts on our results of operations

<<<

.
Wood. We source wood for our operations through a variety of means. We purchase our wood in Australia pursuant to long-term contracts, and for the Boyer mill, approximately 70% of its wood requirements are sourced from its 20,000 hectares

<<<

 of forest assets. In Norway and continental Europe, wood is purchased pursuant to short- and medium-term contracts.
Recovered paper. Recovered paper supplies are largely purchased through short-term contracts, mainly at market prices. There

<<<

 have been relatively small fluctuations in recovered paper prices in recent years. We primarily use recovered paper in our European newsprint operations.
Transportation. Transportation costs comprise both the costs related to the delivery of

<<<

 our finished products to our customers, which are recorded in our income statement as distribution costs, and costs related to the delivery of raw materials to our mills, which are recorded in our income statement as cost of materials. We are

<<<

 responsible for the shipping costs in respect of the majority of our raw material purchases and sales of our finished products and our results are therefore subject to changes in transportation costs, largely due to fluctuations in fuel prices

<<<

 and currency.
Fluctuation in the value o f energy contracts
We enter into energy supply contracts based on our estimates of the amount of energy we will require to operate our business in the future. Under certain of these contracts, due to

<<<

 capacity reductions or other reasons, the amount of energy we require is less than we contracted for, and we resell the excess energy in the market. Historically, energy resales were a significant factor affecting our results. Presently, however

<<<

, most of our mills are sourced to need and energy resales will not be expected to have the same impact on our future results of operations. In addition to resale revenues, we operate a geo- thermal energy production facility co-located at our

<<<

 mill in New Zealand from which we generate revenue from sales of excess energy into the spot energy market.
Under IFRS, contracts containing embedded derivatives are valued either with the whole contract or separately at fair value. Fair value

<<<

 is calculated as the difference between the projected market price and the projected contract price over the contract period, discounted to present value. Changes in fair value are recorded as income or expense, as applicable, in our income

<<<

 statement. Since the fair value is based on market expectations for energy prices and currency, interest rates and price indices, changes in fair value produce large fluctuations in our results of operations due to the large volumes and contract

<<<

 lengths associated with energy contracts. We revalue our energy contracts every quarter. Due
59

to volatility in the market price of energy and certain currencies, it is impossible to predict what the impact of such revaluation will be on

<<<

 our income statement and balance sheet from quarter to quarter. These accounting effects have no impact on cash flow.
As of September 30, 2015, the net book value of our commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity contracts was

<<<

 NOK 176 million. The fluctuations are non-cash items that are recorded in the income statement under other gains and losses.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Norwegian kroner. Items

<<<

 reflected in the consolidated financial statements of each of our subsidiaries are initially recorded using the currency of the primary economic location in which the entity operates (except for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 

<<<

2013 for our subsidiaries in Latin America, where the functional currency was the U.S. dollar). Transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction

<<<

. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of these transactions and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period-end exchange rates are recognized as realized/unrealized

<<<

 gains or losses on foreign currency in our income statement. Exchange rate differences arising from the settlement of accounts receivable/payable and unrealized gains/losses on the same positions are recognized in operating revenue/cost of

<<<

 materials, respectively. Gains and losses that relate to borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and currency hedging are presented in our income statement as financial items. Subsequently, upon consolidation, the accounts of our subsidiaries

<<<

 that are presented in currencies other than Norwegian kroner are translated into Norwegian kroner at Norges Bank's official rates prevailing on our balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for

<<<

 the period. Any exchange differences arising are recognized as comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves.
Our results of operations are subject to both translation effects and transaction effects as a result of fluctuations

<<<

 in exchange rates. While our reporting currency is the Norwegian kroner, our subsidiaries generate revenue and incur costs primarily in Euro, U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, Australian dollars and New Zealand dollars (in addition to Norwegian

<<<

 kroner). For example, for the year ended December 31, 2014, 74.0% of our operating revenues were derived from European markets other than Norway and from Australasian markets, where prices and costs are denominated and paid in currencies other

<<<

 than Norwegian kroner. As of September 30, 2015, 96.1% of our total interest-bearing non-current liabilities were denominated in currencies other than Norwegian kroner, with approximately 78.4% denominated in Euro and 15.8% in U.S. dollars

<<<

. Consequently, our results are affected by any material depreciation or appreciation of these currencies against the Norwegian kroner.
Currency transaction effects primarily relate to our Norwegian operations, which incur expenses mainly in

<<<

 Norwegian kroner, but which sell a large proportion of their output on the export market and generate revenue in foreign currency (primarily Euro, pounds sterling and U.S. dollars). However, we currently do not have any outstanding currency

<<<

 hedging agreements (see "--Factors Affecting Comparability--Impact from currency changes and other factors under financial items'").
From time to time, we hedge parts of our expected cash flow in foreign currency. The purpose of this is to

<<<

 improve predictability of our cash flows. Forward contracts and options may be used to hedge cash flows. See "-- Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk--Exchange rate risk".
Increases in interest rates
We primarily have

<<<

 fixed-rate borrowings, which are carried as liabilities on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2015, the total carrying value of all total interest-bearing liabilities was NOK 9,148 million, and the total value of cash and cash equivalents

<<<

 was NOK 699 million.
For a discussion of our past hedging activities with respect to interest rates, see "--Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk--Interest rate risk".
Impact of decline in value offixed assets
We are required

<<<

 to determine the value of our fixed assets (principally the machines we use in our mills) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events can include the closure of a mill or

<<<

 a reduction in the production capacity of a mill. When the carrying amount exceeds the net present value of future cash flows from the asset, the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our income statement.
60

Cost control and

<<<

 operational efficiency
A proportion of our total operating expenses are fixed, which means that profitability, particularly in an environment of declining prices, depends in part on cost control and operating efficiency. During the periods

<<<

 under review, we have implemented a number of cost control and operational efficiency programs and measures, and we continue to monitor opportunities to implement further programs and measures. In addition to mill closures and disposals and

<<<

 production suspensions, these programs and measures have included the optimization of energy usage at our mills, the consolidation of sales and distribution resources and use of sales agents and the streamlining of headquarter operations. Due

<<<

 to the combination of mill closures and disposals and cost-reduction initiatives, our employee headcount decreased from 5,078 employees as of December 31, 2011 to 2,560 employees as of September 30, 2015. In general, the effects of cost control

<<<

 and operational efficiency programs and measures are reflected in improvements in operating expense items, gross operating earnings and gross operating margins. We may also record restructuring expenses in connection with cost-reduction initiatives

<<<

, which can be significant. For example, we recorded NOK 59 million of restructuring expenses in 2011 for a cost-reduction program at the Walsum mill.
Acquisitions and disposals
During the periods under review we have made a number of significant

<<<

 disposals and reductions in capacity. In addition, in the future we may make further disposals and other reductions in capacity and potentially may make acquisitions in line with our business strategy. Any of these actions may significantly

<<<

 affect our financial condition and results of operations. See "--Factors Affecting Comparability--Significant disposals or reductions in capacity'. We may incur substantial additional debt in connection with any acquisition.
Seasonality
In

<<<

 general, market demand for our products is not constant over the year. We typically experience strong seasonal demand in the fourth quarter due to Christmas advertising and Christmas catalogs, and in the Northern hemisphere, we experience a

<<<

 seasonal increase in demand in the second quarter due to the printing of holiday brochures ahead of the summer holiday season. For example, for the three months ended March 31, 2014, we generated gross operating earnings of NOK 153 million

<<<

, while our gross operating earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2013 were NOK 298 million. The decrease of NOK 145 million in our gross operating earnings between the two quarters compared is due to lower volumes. For reasons related

<<<

 to operational efficiency, we maintain production levels relatively stable throughout the year, such that seasonal increases in demand are satisfied through inventory. Consequently, changes in inventories can be significant from quarter to

<<<

 quarter, although from one year to the next, the overall change in inventories is typically small.
Factors Affecting Comparability
The key factors affecting comparability of our results of operations during the periods under review include

<<<

:
Changes in reporting segments
Due to changes in our business and the way we operate and manage our business during the periods under review, we have made several changes to our operating segments. These changes affect comparability of our

<<<

 results of operations during the periods under review.
Effective January 1, 2014, we reorganized our operations into two geographically-oriented operating segments: Publication Paper Europe and Publication Paper Australasia. During the years

<<<

 ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had previously organized our operating segments by geography and product class in three operating segments: Newsprint Europe, Newsprint Outside Europe and Magazine Paper. The two Newsprint segments reported

<<<

 figures for the newsprint assets located in Europe and the rest of the world, respectively, and the results of our European magazine paper operations were reported under Magazine Paper. Prior to 2012, in addition to our two Newsprint operating

<<<

 segments and our Magazine Paper operating segment, we maintained an Energy operating segment. The activities of the Energy operating segment have been included in our financial reporting under Other Activities with effect from January 1, 2

<<<

012. We have not prepared or presented in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum operating segment information reflecting the retrospective effect of the January 1, 2014 change to operating segments for the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2012.
Significant disposals or reductions in capacity
Since January 1, 2012, as part of our strategy to streamline and refocus our business, we have disposed of a number of our businesses and assets and reduced production capacity through

<<<

 permanent closures:
61

 Exclusion o f Walsum mill (2015). In 2015, we stopped providing financial support to the Walsum mill and it is no longer part of the operations of the Group.
 Disposal o f Brazilian Pisa operations (2013). We sold

<<<

 a majority interest in the Pisa business in Brazil, which had an annual production capacity of 185,000 tons in June 2013 and sold the remaining 49% minority interest in 2014.
 Disposal o f Thailand Singburi operations (2013). We sold the Singburi

<<<

 newsprint mill in Thailand in November 2013.
 Closure o f Walsum paper machine (2013). We permanently closed one of the paper machines at the Walsum mill in Germany with an annual production capacity of 225,000 tons of coated paper in December

<<<

 2013.
 Closure o f Tasman paper machine (2013). We permanently closed one of the two paper machines at the Tasman mill in New Zealand with an annual production capacity of 160,000 tons of newsprint in January 2013.
 Disposal o f Chilean Bio

<<<

 Bio operations (2012). We sold the Bio Bio newsprint mill in Chile in 2012.
 Disposal o fFollum mill (2012). In December 2011, we closed the Follum mill in Norway, which produced newsprint and magazine paper. In June 2012, we sold the land

<<<

 and the energy contracts related to the mill.
 Disposal o f Parenco mill (2012). We sold the Parenco mill in the Netherlands, which produced newsprint and magazine paper, in August 2012.
 Disposal o fReparco (2012). We sold the Reparco global

<<<

 recovered paper business in August 2012.
The disposal of businesses and assets and the reduction of production capacity have a number of effects on our results of operations. In general, disposals and reductions of capacity result in decreases

<<<

 in operating revenues, operating expenses and gross operating earnings in subsequent periods. In some cases, the disposal of a profitable business, such as the Pisa mill in Brazil, can negatively impact gross operating margins in subsequent

<<<

 periods. We may recognize one-time gains or losses as a result of disposals, which are recorded as other gains and losses in the income statement. We have generally applied a portion of the proceeds from disposals to reduce our indebtedness

<<<

.
We generally will record restructuring expenses in connection with reductions of capacity through closures. For example, we recorded NOK 105 million of restructuring expenses in 2012 in connection with the closure of newsprint capacity at

<<<

 the Tasman mill. We may also record significant impairment charges with respect to a planned closure of capacity. Closures may also have a positive impact on working capital and operating cash flow, due to the release of working capital following

<<<

 such closure.
Implementation o f accounting standard IAS 19
We implemented the amended accounting standard IAS 19 Employee Benefits with effect from January 1, 2013, with full retrospective application. We have included restated 2012 financial

<<<

 information for the purposes of comparison in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum to give effect to this implementation. For a description of the implementation effects of amended accounting standard IAS 19, see note 13

<<<

 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Impactfrom currency changes and otherfactors underfinancial items
Effective from October 2014, we terminated our remaining currency hedging agreements. Historically

<<<

, our forward contracts and currency options were subject to fair market valuation at the end of each financial quarter, changes in which were recognized in our income statement as a financial item. As a result, the currency impact of changes

<<<

 in exchange rates on our results, which is recognized in our income statement, could be significant. Net translation effects in respect of foreign currency-denominated debt could also be significant, primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated debt

<<<

, as we do not have many assets in U.S. dollars. Translation differences on most of the other debt denominated in foreign currencies were generally together with assets in the same currency, and the translation difference was recognized in equity

<<<

. Furthermore, we have from time to time repurchased our debt securities as part of the management of our capital structure and have recognized gains and losses as a result of such repurchases.

Disruptions or other stoppages in production capacity

Our results of operations can be impacted by disruptions or other stoppages

<<<

 in our production capacity. These events can be due to involuntary reasons, such as fires, or voluntary reasons, such as the conversion of a paper machine or the temporary idling (or the reduction in utilization rates) of a paper machine to

<<<

 address issues such as inventory build-ups or energy price developments. The impact on our results of operations of such events depends on the nature of the disruption or stoppage, and other factors such as whether the event is covered by insurance

<<<

 (including business interruption insurance to cover lost margins).

From mid-December 2013 until April 2014, operations at one of the two paper machines at our Boyer mill were suspended. While the machine was offline, we converted the machine

<<<

 to produce magazine paper instead of newsprint. The converted machine is our first magazine paper machine in Australasia, and the only magazine producing machine in that market. During the period of the machine's conversion, production capacity

<<<

 at our Boyer facility declined from 22,500 tons of newsprint per month to 12,500 tons of newsprint per month. Following the conversion, the Boyer mill has capacity to produce 12,500 tons of newsprint per month and 11,667 tons of magazine paper

<<<

 per month. As a result of the conversion, revenues and gross operating earnings for the Publication Paper Australasia operating segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were negatively impacted. Our results of operations for the

<<<

 nine months ended September 30, 2015 were positively impacted compared to the first nine months ended September 30, 2014, as the Boyer magazine paper machine improved its production and performance levels.

From the third week of June 2015

<<<

 until the first week of November, operations at one paper machine at our Skogn mill in Norway was temporary halted due to the challenging European newsprint market. The shutdown was originally planned as a temporary downtime for nine weeks

<<<

 during the summer period in order to cut cost and support the European market balance. However, due to the continuing challenging market conditions for newsprint, the machine stop was prolonged until the first week of November.

Results of Operations

For a discussion of our results of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine month period ended

<<<

 September 30, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, see our 2014 Annual Report (pages 38-40) and our Third Quarter 2015 Report (pages 1-6), attached hereto as Exhibits I and II.

Liquidity and

<<<

 Capital Resources

Liquidity risk management

We are exposed to liquidity risk in a scenario where our cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to cover payments of financial liabilities. In order to effectively mitigate liquidity

<<<

 risk, our risk management strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient cash and securing available financing through committed credit facilities. Managing liquidity risk is centralized on a Group level.

In order to manage future liquidity risk

<<<

, we forecast both short-term and long-term cash flows. Cash flow forecasts include cash flows stemming from operations, investments, asset sales, financing activities and financial instruments.

63

Liquidity
As of September 30, 2015, without

<<<

 giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (but giving effect to the repayment of the 2015 Notes on October 15, 2015), we had total interest bearing liabilities of NOK 8,946 million, including 108 million (NOK 1,033 million) of 2016 Notes

<<<

 and 212 million (NOK 2,024 million) of 2017 Notes. Our liquidity position as of September 30, 2015, was approximately NOK 1,000 million, including cash and cash equivalents of NOK 699 million and unused headroom under committed financing frames

<<<

 in existing securitization/factoring program capacity. As of December 31, 2015, our cash balances included restricted cash of approximately NOK 250 million. A liquidity buffer of around NOK 200 million is prudent to allow for daily volatility

<<<

 in working capital.
There is a very significant risk that, absent substantial material improvement in short and medium term trading conditions, our existing cash balances, together with our anticipated cash flow from operations and other capital

 resources, will be insufficient to allow us to satisfy the payments of principal on the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes as they become due in June 2016 and June 2017, respectively. Our ability to satisfy these obligations may accordingly depend

<<<

, in part, on the successful completion of the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations, or one or more alternative transactions, such as raising additional secured debt or making asset sales. However, the quantum of any new secured debt

<<<

 and the permitted use of proceeds from the issuance of such debt or from asset sales is significantly constrained by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes.
In addition, the financial performance of the Group over

<<<

 the recent quarters and the currency effects on the total financial leverage of the Group from the continuing weakening of the Norwegian kroner have together reduced the total equity of the Group from NOK 1,497 million as of December 31, 2

<<<

014 (restated) to NOK 547 million as of September 30, 2015. There is a significant risk that the equity level of the Group will continue to be reduced by the net financial results of the Group, further depreciation of the Norwegian kroner and

<<<

 other negative one-off items. This situation is sought to be partly addressed by the expected effects of the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations, which if completed, should materially improve the equity position of the Group.
In the

<<<

 Exchange Offers, the Parent is offering the Eligible Holders of the Parent's Relevant 2016 Notes to exchange their 2016 Notes for newly issued QSF Exchange Notes, Exchange Notes due 2019 and Perpetual Notes and Equity Subscription Rights and

<<<

 to Eligible Holders of the 2017 Notes for newly issued QSF Exchange Notes, Exchange Notes due 2026 and Perpetual Notes and Equity Subscription Rights, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Exchange Offer. Pursuant to the Consent Solicitations

<<<

, the Parent is soliciting consents from the Eligible Holders of the Parent's outstanding 2017 Notes to amend the maturity, principal amount and interest rate on the 2017 Notes and to permit the redemption or mandatory exchange of the 2017 Notes

<<<

 for other debt securities.
There is a minimum tender condition of 90% of the 2016 Notes and 75% of the 2017 Notes in the Exchange Offers. The Parent reserves the right to decrease or waive the minimum tender condition in its sole discretion

<<<

 without providing for an extension of the duration of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations.
Under the agreement among GSO, Cyrus and the Parent, GSO and Cyrus have committed to tender their holdings of the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes

<<<

 in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, which holdings (together with the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes that are being acquired from the Parent) represent 37.6% and 68.2% respectively, of the outstanding 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes. If

<<<

 the minimum tender conditions are not satisfied (or waived) and the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are not completed, the very material uncertainty surrounding the Group's liquidity position in 2016 and 2017 may cause and/or require

<<<

 the officers and directors of subsidiary operating companies in the Group to consider whether they can continue to provide monies to the Parent, which the Parent relies upon to satisfy its liabilities. The Parent's independent auditors may

<<<

 also issue an audit opinion on our December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements on a qualified basis as to their assumption of our ability to continue as a going concern, which could raise concerns among our trade creditors and other

<<<

 finance providers. In such circumstances, the Parent would be forced to consider any and all available options, which may include a non-consensual comprehensive balance sheet restructuring of the Parent. There can be no assurance that the Exchange

<<<

 Offers and Consent Solicitations will be completed, or as to the aggregate principal amount of each series of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that will be exchanged for Exchange Notes.
We believe that the successful completion of the Exchange Offers

<<<

 and Consent Solicitations will protect value for all of our stakeholders and position us to take advantage of a cyclical improvement in the publication paper industry cycle. The completion will also provide protection of the position of holders

<<<

 of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes. After the completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, we will still have significant cash interest expense, high financial leverage and significant debt repayment obligations due in 20

<<<

19.
We believe that the potential significant risks to our liquidity include:
64

 a reduction in operating cash flows due to a decline in the profitability of our business, which could be due to downturns in our performance, the publication

<<<

 paper industry in Europe or Australasia or general economic conditions;
 if the Exchange Offers are not consummated, our short-term and medium-term maturity indebtedness will require us to repay NOK 1,374 million and NOK 2,283 million in 

<<<

2016 and 2017, respectively, including maturities in 2016 and 2017; and
 a reduction in sales or gross operating earnings due to our inability to successfully manage working capital and attain further operational cost savings.
If our future

<<<

 operating cash flows and other capital resources (including availability under our factoring and securitization facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:
 reduce

<<<

 or delay our capital expenditures;
 close or curtail operations at our mills and further reduce our sales and overhead staffs;
 dispose of assets;
 obtain additional debt or equity capital; or
 refinance or restructure all or a portion

<<<

 of our debt.
There can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In addition, the terms of our debt, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue

<<<

 any of these alternatives.
Cash Flows
For a discussion of our cash flows for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2013, see our Third Quarter 2015 report (pages 1-6) and our 2014 Annual Report (pages 38-40), attached hereto as Exhibits I and II.
Working Capital Requirements
We actively monitor and manage our working capital requirements

<<<

. Generally, our working capital requirements are seasonal and we experience slightly lower cash flow in the first half of the year due to the ramp up in working capital and production of inventories. The focus on optimizing our working capital

<<<

 has been a top priority and our working capital requirements have declined faster than other Group requirements since 2011. We have reduced our working capital requirements primarily through reductions in inventories and an improved control

<<<

 of accounts receivable. The release of working capital over the past three years has been a positive contributor to our cash flow.
Capital Expenditures
For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and the nine months ended September

<<<

 30, 2015, we recorded capital expenditures of NOK 492 million, NOK 529 million, NOK 274 million and NOK 119 million, respectively.
We estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2015 will be approximately NOK 200 million, of which the

<<<

 remaining investments primarily will be related to minor maintenance projects at several of our mills. We estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2016 will be NOK 275 million, including investments related to growth and diversified

<<<

 projects such as biogas at our Saugbrugs mill of approximately NOK 100 million. However, due to separate financing arrangements for the growth projects, we expect that the net cash flow effect related to our capital expenditures will decrease

<<<

 in 2016 compared to 2015.
Contractual Obligations
The following table sets forth the maturity of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 (without taking into account the effect of any actions taken post-December 31, 2014):

W e are exposed to various

<<<

, as well as standards fo r managing exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and the use o f financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance w ith policies and standards is continuously

<<<

 monitored.

Interest rate risk

There has historically been a correlation betw een economic trends and interest rate movements, with interest rates falling during an economic dow nturn and rising in an economic recovery. We seek to structure

<<<

 our deb t portfolio such that interest costs partly offset changes in revenue as a consequence o f changes in the economic climate. The goal of interest rate risk m anagement is to secure the lowest possible interest rate payments over time

<<<

 w ithin acceptable risk limits. In the current challenging situation in the publication paper market, we have secured m ost o f the interest rate payments by primarily paying fixed interest rates on our debt obligations.

66

Exchange rate risk
Due to our position as an international

<<<

 paper production company with a significant cost base in Norway, we incur significant costs in Norwegian kroner while our sales are predominantly in foreign currencies.
We are exposed to currency risk in the following areas:
 translation risk

<<<

, where assets and debt valued in foreign currencies have to be translated into Norwegian kroner on our balance sheet; and
 transaction risk, which arises as a result of our positive cash flow being predominantly in foreign currencies, while

<<<

 our negative cash flow is predominantly in Norwegian kroner.
Translation risk arises when our accounts are consolidated in Norwegian kroner and translation differences arise on assets and debt denominated in foreign currencies. The value of

<<<

 our assets and debt are adjusted for this translation difference, thereby affecting important key ratios such as our gearing ratio (net interest-bearing debt to equity). Translation risk is managed by ensuring that our net debt is denominated

<<<

 in a mix of currencies in which we also hold assets, in order to reduce fluctuations in key financial ratios resulting from currency rate movements. However, the net investment hedging is also organized in such a way as to distribute debt to

<<<

 currencies in which we have positive cash flows. In the past, we have used currency and interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
In the past, we have used various financial instruments

<<<

 to hedge our exposure to currency transaction risk. In general, we calculate a twelve-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling basis (the "rolling cash flow hedge"). At any one time, a portion of our twelve-month expected

<<<

 cash flow exposure is hedged using forward contracts and currency options. We do not use hedge accounting for the rolling cash flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a gain of NOK 2 million in 2014, a loss of NOK 66 million in 2

<<<

013 and a gain of NOK 149 million in 2012. Over time, currency losses or earnings are expected to offset increased or reduced future gross operating earnings.
Commodity risk
A major part of our global commodity demand, primarily energy, is purchased

<<<

 through long-term contracts. We only use financial instruments to a small degree to hedge these contracts. The hedging ratio represents a trade-off between risk exposure and the opportunity to take advantage of short-term price drops in the

<<<

 spot market. Hedging levels are regulated through mandates approved by the Board of Directors.
Certain of our purchase and sales contracts are derivatives, or contain embedded derivatives, which fall within the scope of IAS 39. These derivatives

<<<

 are measured in our balance sheet at fair value with value changes recognized through profit or loss. Commodity contracts are either financial contracts for the purpose of trading or hedging, or physical commodity contracts that are not for

<<<

 the purpose of our own use. The embedded derivatives are common in physical commodity contracts and comprise a wide variety of derivative characteristics.
Changes in fair value of commodity contracts reflect unrealized gains or losses and are

<<<

 calculated as the difference between market price and contract price discounted to present value. Some commodity contracts are bilateral contracts or embedded derivatives in bilateral contracts, for which there exists no active market. Hence

<<<

, valuation techniques which use available market information are used as much as possible. In the absence of observable market information, valuation techniques that reflect how the market could be expected to price instruments are used.
Our

<<<

 portfolio of commodity contracts consists mostly of physical energy contracts. Fair value of commodity contracts is therefore especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts

<<<

 depends on price index fluctuations.
In April 2013, we signed a new long-term energy contract for the supply of electricity for our paper mill in Halden. The new energy contract secures an annual supply of 1.0 terawatt-hours ("TWh") up to December

<<<

 2020. The agreement became effective on May 1, 2013. The contract ensures almost full energy coverage for the paper mill in Halden over the contract period. During 2013, we also terminated one of our long-term group energy contracts from 1

<<<

998 that we used for energy supply in Southern Norway.
In September 2015, we entered into a contract with Nord-Trandelag Elektrisitetsverk ("NTE") providing for the supply of 0.4TWh per year of electricity to our Skogn mill until December 3

<<<

1, 2016. The contract replaces the agreement with NTE signed in 2012. The new agreement with NTE will, together with the agreement that was signed with Statkraft in 2011, secure the Skogn mill sufficient energy for the full operations of the

<<<

 plant.
67

Credit risk
We make a credit evaluation of all financial trading counterparties. Based on the evaluation, a limit on credit exposure is established for each counterparty. These limits are monitored continuously in relation to unrealized

<<<

 profit on financial instruments and placements. The maximum credit risk arising from financial instruments is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets on our balance sheet. This includes derivatives with positive market value

<<<

 except for embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives are not subjected to credit risk, as there are no future cash flows associated with such derivatives.
We trade with a group of large Nordic and international banks which are publicly rated

<<<

 in the interval from AAto A - (unchanged from 2012). The credit risk on deposits and derivative transactions is spread across theses banks.
Our procedures for credit management of European trade receivables, and the authority to approve credit

<<<

 lines to customers of European business units, are regulated by a policy drafted and maintained by a centralized credit management function at our head office. The operational responsibility to act within the guidelines as set out by this policy

<<<

 lies with each business unit. For operations outside of Europe, customer credit management is handled locally.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our principal accounting policies are described in more detail in note 2 to our Consolidated Financial

<<<

 Statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect

<<<

 the amounts reported. Estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, though actual results and timing could differ from the estimates.
On January 1, 2015, the Parent changed its

<<<

 accounting principles with respect to embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway. As a result, we stated the items impacted by this change in our accounting principles and included some of them in this exchange offer and solicitation

<<<

 memorandum, see "Summary Consolidated and Other Financial Data".
Management believes that the accounting policies below represent those matters requiring the exercise of judgment where a different opinion could result in the greatest changes

<<<

 to reported results.
Estimated decline in value o f intangible assets andproperty, plant and equipment ("PPE")
We perform periodic tests to assess whether there has been a decline in the value of intangible assets and tangible fixed assets

<<<

. Tangible fixed assets and intangible assets are written down to their recoverable amount when the recoverable amount is lower than the assets carrying value. The recoverable amount from assets or cash-generating units is determined by calculating

<<<

 the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates.
The

<<<

 capitalized value of intangible assets and PPE within the cash- generating units is measured against the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within these units. A possible future change in the composition of our cash-generating units

<<<

 could mean changes in the value in use within cash-generating units, which could, in turn, mean a future decline in the value of intangible assets and tangible fixed assets.
Calculating the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within the

<<<

 cash-generating units is based on estimated discounted cash flows. The cash flow horizon in the impairment model is consistent with the useful life of each paper machine in the group. The board-approved operating plan for the next year forms

<<<

 the basis for calculating expected cash flows. In the impairment testing, sales prices are assumed to exhibit a decline in real terms and variable costs are assumed to decline in real terms, with lower demand for input factors due to a shrinking

<<<

 industry.
The estimation of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that

<<<

 there will be uncertainty when it comes to the outcome of the calculations. We perform sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations will impact recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made

<<<

 in the calculation of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate used. Changes in these factors will have the effect of altering the

<<<

 value of cash flows and thereby also the value in use within the cash-generating units. Significant changes in prognoses and long-term prices could accordingly mean a future fall in the value of intangible assets and tangible fixed assets.

<<<


68

The required rate of return applied when discounting future cash flows is crucial for the calculated value of intangible assets and PPE. A future increase in the required return when discounting future cash flows will reduce value in use

<<<

 and could, in turn, mean a future decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
Fair value o f derivatives and otherfinancial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by

<<<

 using valuation techniques. We use our judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The contracts are recognized in our balance sheet in accordance

<<<

 with IAS 39, which means that the value consists of the difference between the estimated market price and contract price over the contract period, discounted to present value. If the market for contracts is not active, we apply valuation techniques

<<<

 to establish the fair value. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments which are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analyses.
The value can fluctuate significantly from quarter to

<<<

 quarter due to changes in expected future energy prices, and is also affected by changes in exchange rates, price indices and the discount rate used.
Annual assessment of the remaining economic life o f tangiblefixed assets
We make annual assessments

<<<

 of the remaining economic life of tangible fixed assets. An increase or decrease in the remaining economic life could have an effect on future depreciation.
Provisionfor future environmental obligations
Our provision for future environmental

<<<

 obligations is based on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment. Changes in any of these assumptions could have an impact on our provision and costs.
Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring

<<<

 activities and legal claims are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably

<<<

 estimated.
Where a number of similar obligations exist, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow

<<<

 with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects

<<<

 current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized within financial items.
As of December 31, 2014, we had a provision for future

<<<

 environmental obligations of NOK 211 million which are presented on our balance sheet as other non-current liabilities.
Residual value and dismantlingprovision
The residual value of our production equipment is valued as the anticipated realizable

<<<

 value on our balance sheet date, after deducting the estimated costs relating to asset dismantling, removal and restoration. If the estimated costs exceed the estimated residual values, the net liability is added to the fixed asset cost in

<<<

 our balance sheet and a provision is recognized as a liability. We perform a review of the residual value of our production equipment at the end of each accounting year. Residual value is affected by short-term changes in the underlying assumptions

<<<

, for example scrap metal prices. A change in the residual value could have an impact on future depreciation costs. The provision for dismantling costs is based on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment.
Pensions
The present

<<<

 value of the pension obligation depends on several input factors that are determined by means of a number of actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the net pension expense (income) includes the discount rate. Changes in

<<<

 these assumptions will affect the carrying value of the pension obligation.

SHARE CAPITAL AND SECURITIES TRADING IN NORWAY
Share Capital
The ordinary shares o f the Parent have been listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange since 1976. As o f O ctober 31, 2015, the share capital w as N O K 189,945,626, divided into

<<<

 189,945,626 shares w ith a nom inal value o f N O K 1. The Parent does not have any other classes o f share capital. All shares have equal rights. As of O ctober 31, 2015, the Parent held 19,667 o f its shares as treasury shares. The B oard

<<<

 o f D irectors o f the P arent is authorized to increase the P a re n t's share capital by up to NO K 94,972,763 (constituting approximately 50% o f the outstanding shares as o f October 31, 2015), by way o f new share issuance. W e do not

<<<

 currently have in issue any convertible debt securities, exchangeable debt securities or debt securities w ith warrants attached.
General meetings
Through the general meeting, shareholders exercise supreme authority in a Norwegian company.

<<<

 In accordance w ith Norwegian law, the annual general meeting o f shareholders is required to be held each year on or prior to 30 June. Norwegian law requires that w ritten notice o f annual general meetings setting forth the time of, the venue

<<<

 for and the agenda o f the m eeting be sent to all shareholders w ith a know n address no later than 21 days before the annual general m eeting o f a N orw egian public limited liability company listed on a stock exchange or a regulated market

<<<

 shall be held, unless the articles o f association stipulate a longer deadline, w hich is not currently the case for the Parent.
A shareholder may vote at the general meeting either in person or by proxy appointed at their own discretion. In

<<<

 accordance w ith the requirements o f the Norw egian Securities Trading Act, the Parent will include a proxy form w ith notices o f general m eetings. A ll o f the P aren t's shareholders w ho are registered in the register o f shareholders

<<<

 m aintained w ith the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) as o f the fifth day prior to the date o f the general meeting are entitled to participate at general meetings, without any requirem ent o f pre-registration.
Apart from the

<<<

 annual general meeting, extraordinary general meetings o f shareholders may be held if the Board o f Directors considers it necessary. A n extraordinary general m eeting o f shareholders m ust also be convened if, in order to discuss a specified

<<<

 matter, the auditor or shareholders representing at least 5% o f the share capital demands this in writing. The requirements for notice and adm ission to the annual general m eeting also apply to extraordinary general meetings. However, the

<<<

 annual general meeting o f a Norwegian public limited company may w ith a majority o f at least two-thirds o f the aggregate num ber of votes cast as well as at least two-thirds of the share capital represented at a general meeting resolve

<<<

 that extraordinary general meetings may be convened w ith a fourteen days notice period until the next annual general meeting provided the company has procedures in place allowing shareholders to vote electronically.
Voting rights - amendments

<<<

 to the Articles of Association
E ach o f the P a re n t's O rdinary Shares carries one vote. In general, decisions that shareholders are entitled to m ake under N orw egian law o r the P a re n t's A rticles o f A ssociation m ay b e m ade

<<<

 by a sim ple m ajority o f the votes cast. In the case o f elections or appointments, the person(s) who receive(s) the greatest number o f votes cast are elected. However, as required under N orw egian law, certain decisions, including resolutions

<<<

 to waive preferential rights to subscribe in connection w ith any share issue in the Parent, to approve a merger or dem erger o f the Parent, to am end the Articles o f Association, to authorise an increase or reduction in the share capital

<<<

, to authorise an issuance o f convertible loans or warrants by the Parent or to authorise the Board o f Directors to purchase Ordinary Shares and hold them as treasury shares or to dissolve the Parent, must receive the approval o f at least

<<<

 two-thirds o f the aggregate num ber o f votes cast as well as at least two-thirds o f the share capital represented at a general meeting. Norwegian law further requires that certain decisions, which have the effect of substantially altering

<<<

 the rights and preferences of any shares or class of shares, receive the approval by the holders o f such shares or class o f shares as well as the majority required for amending the Articles o f Association.
D ecisions that (i) w ould reduce

<<<

 the rights o f som e o r all o f the P a re n t's shareholders in respect o f dividend paym ents or other rights to assets or (ii) restrict the transferability o f the Ordinary Shares, require that at least 90% o f the share capital represented

<<<

 at the general meeting in question vote in favour of the resolution, as well as the majority required for amending the Articles o f Association.
In general, only a shareholder registered in the VPS is entitled to vote for such Ordinary Shares

<<<

. Beneficial owners o f the Ordinary Shares that are registered in the name o f a nominee are generally not entitled to vote under N orw egian law, nor is any person who is designated in the VPS register as the holder o f such Ordinary Shares

<<<

 as nominees. A shareholder must, in order to be eligible to register, meet and vote for such Shares at the general meeting, transfer the O rdinary Shares fro m such nom inee account to an account in the shareholder's nam e in the V PS. P arent

<<<

 has included a "registration date" in its Articles o f Association, and accordingly such registration m ust take place at the latest five business days prior to the date o f the general meeting.
75

There are no quorum requirements that apply

<<<

 to the general meetings.
Additional issuances and preferential rights
I f the P arent issues any new O rdinary Shares, including bonus share issues, the P a re n t's A rticles o f A ssociation must be am ended, which requires the same vote

<<<

 as other am endments to the Articles o f Association. In addition, under N orw egian law, the P a re n t's shareholders have a preferential right to subscribe fo r new O rdinary Shares issued by th e Parent. Preferential rights may be derogated

<<<

 from by resolution in a general meeting passed by the same vote required to amend the Articles o f Association. A derogation o f the shareholders' preferential rights in respect o f bonus issues requires the approval o f all outstanding Ordinary

<<<

 Shares.
The general meeting may, by the same vote as is required for amending the Articles o f Association, authorise the Board o f Directors to issue new Ordinary Shares, and to derogate from the preferential rights o f shareholders in connection

<<<

 w ith such issuances. Such authorisation may be effective for a maximum o f two years, and the nominal value o f the Ordinary Shares to be issued may not exceed 50% o f the registered nom inal share capital w hen the authorisation is registered

<<<

 w ith the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises.
U nder Norwegian law, the Parent may increase its share capital by a bonus share issue, subject to approval by the P aren t's shareholders, by transfer fro m the P a re n t's distributable

<<<

 equity and thus th e share capital increase does not require any paym ent o f a subscription price by the shareholders. Any bonus issues may be affected either by issuing new shares to the P a re n t's existing shareholders o r b y increasing

<<<

 the nom inal value o f the P aren t's o u tstanding O rdinary Shares.
Issuance o f new Ordinary Shares to shareholders who are citizens or residents o f the U nited States upon the exercise o f preferential rights may require the Parent to

<<<

 file a registration statement in the United States under United States securities laws. Should the P arent in such a situation decide not to file a registration statem ent, the P aren t's U.S. shareholders may not be able to exercise their

<<<

 preferential rights. If a U.S. shareholder is ineligible to participate in a rights offering, such shareholder would not receive the rights at all and the Parent would seek to sell such rights on the shareholder's behalf.
Minority rights
N

<<<

 orw egian law sets forth a num ber o f protections for minority shareholders o f the Parent, including but not lim ited to those described in this paragraph and the description o f general m eetings as set out above. A ny o f the P aren t's

<<<

 shareholders m ay petition N orw egian courts to have a d ecisio n o f the B oard o f D irectors o r the P a re n t's shareholders made at the general meeting declared invalid on the grounds that it unreasonably favours certain shareholders

<<<

 or third parties to the detrim ent o f o ther shareholders o r the P arent itself. The P aren t's shareholders m ay also p etition the courts to dissolve the Parent as a result o f such decisions to the extent particularly strong reasons are

<<<

 considered by the court to make necessary dissolution o f the Parent.
M inority shareholders holding 5% o r m ore o f the P a re n t's share capital have a right to dem and in w riting that the P aren t's B oard o f D irectors convene a n extraordinary

<<<

 general m eeting to discuss o r resolve specific m atters. In addition, any o f the P a re n t's shareholders m ay in w riting dem and that the P arent place a n item o n the agenda fo r any general m eeting as long as the P a re n t's B oard

<<<

 o f D irectors is notified w ith in seven days before the deadline fo r convening the general meeting and the demand is accompanied with a proposed resolution or a reason for why the item shall be on the agenda. If the notice has been issued

<<<

 w hen such a w ritten dem and is presented, a renewed notice must be issued if the deadline for issuing notice o f the general meeting has not expired.
Rights of redemption and repurchase of Ordinary Shares
The share capital of the Parent may

<<<

 be reduced by reducing the nominal value of the Ordinary Shares or by cancelling Ordinary Shares. Such a decision requires the approval o f at least two-thirds of the aggregate num ber of votes cast and at least two-thirds o f the share capital

<<<

 represented at a general meeting. Redem ption o f individual Ordinary Shares requires the consent o f the holders of the Ordinary Shares to be redeemed.
The Parent may purchase its own Ordinary Shares provided that the Board o f Directors has

<<<

 been granted an authorisation to do so by a general meeting w ith the approval o f at least two-thirds o f the aggregate num ber o f votes cast and at least tw o-thirds o f the share capital represented at the meeting. The aggregate nom inal

<<<

 value o f treasury shares so acquired, and held by the P arent m ust not exceed 10% o f the P a re n t's share capital, and treasury shares m ay only b e acquired if the P a re n t's distributable equity, according to the latest adopted balance

<<<

 sheet, exceeds the consideration to be p aid fo r the shares. The authorisation by the general m eeting o f the P a re n t's shareholders cannot b e granted fo r a period exceeding 18 m onths.
76

Shareholder vote on certain reorganisations

<<<


A decision by the Parent to merge w ith another company or to demerge requires a resolution by the general meeting of the shareholders passed by at least two-thirds of the aggregate votes cast and at least two-thirds of the share capital represented

<<<

 at the general meeting. A merger plan, or demerger plan signed by the Board of Directors along with certain other required docum entation, w ould have to b e sent to all the P a re n t's shareholders, or if the A rticles o f A ssociation stipulate

<<<

 that, m ade available to the shareholders o n the co m p an y 's w ebsite, at least one m onth p rio r to the general meeting to pass upon the matter.
Liability of board members
M em bers of the B oard of Directors owe a fiduciary duty to the

<<<

 Parent and its shareholders. Such fiduciary duty requires that the Board M embers act in the best interests of the Parent when exercising their functions and exercise a general duty of loyalty and care towards the Parent. Their principal task

<<<

 is to safeguard the interests of the Parent.
M embers of the Board of Directors may each be held liable for any damage they negligently or wilfully cause the Parent. N orw egian law permits the general meeting to discharge any such person from

<<<

 liability, but such discharge is not binding on the Parent if substantially correct and complete information was not provided at the general meeting of the P aren t's shareholders passing upon the m atter. I f a resolution to discharge the

<<<

 P a re n t's b o ard m em bers fro m liability or not to pursue claims against such a person has been passed by a general meeting w ith a smaller majority than that required to amend the Articles o f Association, shareholders representing more

 than 10% o f the share capital or, if there are m ore th an 100 shareholders, m ore than 10% o f the shareholders m ay pursue the claim o n the P aren t's b e h a lf and in its nam e. The cost o f any such action is not the P a re n t's responsibility

 em bers is m ade by such a m ajority as is necessary to am en d the A rticles o f A ssociation, the m inority shareholders o f the P aren t cannot pursue such claim in the P aren t's name.
Indemnification of board members
N either Norwegian

<<<

 law nor the Articles o f Association contains any provision concerning indemnification by the Parent o f the B oard o f Directors. The Parent is perm itted to purchase insurance for the board m embers against certain liabilities that they may

<<<

 incur in their capacity as such.
Distribution of assets on liquidation
U nder N orw egian law, the P arent m ay be w ound-up b y a resolution o f the P a re n t's shareholders at the general meeting passed by at least two-thirds of the aggregate

 votes cast and at least two-thirds of the share capital represented at the meeting. In the event o f liquidation, the Ordinary Shares rank equally in the event o f a return on capital.
Securities Trading in Norway
Introduction
The Oslo Stock

<<<

 Exchange was established in 1819 and is the principal m arket on w hich shares, bonds and other financial instruments are traded in Norway.
The Oslo Stock Exchange has entered into a strategic cooperation with the London Stock Exchange group

<<<

 with regards to, inter alia, trading systems for equities, fixed income and derivatives.
Trading and settlement
Trading o f equities on the Oslo Stock Exchange is carried out in the electronic trading system M illennium Exchange. This trading

<<<

 system is in use by all markets operated by the London Stock Exchange, including the Borsa ltaliana, as well as by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Official trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange takes place betw een 09:00 hours (CET) and 16:2

<<<

0 hours (CET) each trading day, w ith pre-trade period betw een 08:15 hours (CET) and 09:00 hours (CET), closing auction from 16:20 hours (CET) to 16:25 hours (CET) and a post trade period from 16:25 hours (CET) to 17:30 hours (CET). Reporting

<<<

 o f after exchange trades can be done until 17:30 hours (CET).

The settlement period for trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange is two trading days (T+2). This means that securities w ill be settled o n the investor's account in V PS tw o

 days after the transaction, and th at the seller w ill receive payment after two days.
Oslo Clearing ASA, a wholly-owned subsidiary o f SIX x-clear AG, a company in the SIX group, has a license from the N orw egian F S A to act as a central

<<<

 clearing service, and has fro m 18 June 2010 offered clearing and counterparty services for equity trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange.
Investment services in Norway may only be provided by Norwegian investment firm s holding a license under

<<<

 the Norw egian Securities Trading Act, branches o f investment firms from an EEA m em ber state or investm ent firms from outside the EEA that have been licensed to operate in Norway. Investm ent firm s in an EEA m em ber state may also provide

<<<

 cross-border investment services into Norway.
It is possible for investment firms to undertake market-making activities in shares listed in Norway if they have a license to this effect under the N orw egian Securities Trading Act, or in the

<<<

 case o f investm ent firms in an EEA mem ber state, a license to carry out m arket-m aking activities in their home jurisdiction. Such m arket-m aking activities will be governed by the regulations o f the N orw egian Securities Trading Act

<<<

 relating to brokers' trading for their ow n account. However, such market-making activities do not as such require notification to the N orw egian FSA or the Oslo Stock Exchange except for the general obligation o f investm ent firms that are

<<<

 members o f the Oslo Stock Exchange to report all trades in stock exchange listed securities.
Information, control and surveillance
U nder N orw egian law, the Oslo Stock Exchange is required to perform a num ber o f surveillance and control

<<<

 functions. The Surveillance and Corporate Control unit of the Oslo Stock Exchange monitors all m arket activity on a continuous basis. M arket surveillance systems are largely automated, promptly warning department personnel o f abnormal market

<<<

 developments.
The Norwegian FSA controls the issuance o f securities in both the equity and bond markets in Norway and evaluates w hether the issuance docum entation contains the required inform ation and w hether it would otherwise be unlawful

<<<

 to carry out the issuance.
U nder Norwegian law, a company that is listed on a Norwegian regulated market, or has applied for listing on such market, m ust prom ptly release any inside inform ation directly concerning the company (i.e., precise

<<<

 inform ation about financial instruments, the issuer thereof or other matters w hich are likely to have a significant effect on the price o f the relevant financial instruments or related financial instruments, and which are not publicly available

<<<

 or commonly know n in the market). A company may, however, delay the release o f such inform ation in order not to prejudice its legitimate interests, provided that it is able to ensure the confidentiality o f the inform ation and that the

<<<

 delayed release would not be likely to m islead the public. The Oslo Stock Exchange may levy fines on com panies that violate these requirem ents.
The VPS and transfer of Shares
The P arent's principal share register is operated through the

<<<

 V PS. The VPS is the N orw egian paperless centralised securities register. It is a com puterised book-keeping system in which the ownership of, and all transactions relating to, Norwegian listed shares must be recorded. The VPS and the Oslo

<<<

 Stock Exchange are both wholly-owned by Oslo Brs VPS Holding ASA.
All transactions relating to securities registered with the VPS are made through com puterised book entries. No physical share certificates are, or may be, issued. The VPS confirms

<<<

 each entry by sending a transcript to the registered shareholder irrespective o f any beneficial ownership. To give effect to such entries, the individual shareholder must establish a share account w ith a N orw egian account agent. N o rw

<<<

 eg ian banks, N orges B ank (N orw ay's central bank), authorised securities brokers in Norway and Norwegian branches o f credit institutions established within the EEA are allowed to act as account agents.
As a m atter o f Norwegian law, the

<<<

 Securities Trading Act to notify the Oslo Stock Exchange and the issuer immediately. The same applies if the disclosure thresholds are passed due to other circum stances, such as a change in the co m pany's share capital.
Insider trading
According

<<<

 to N orw egian law, subscription for, purchase, sale or exchange o f financial instrum ents that are listed, or subject to the application for listing, on a N orw egian regulated market, or incitement to such dispositions, must not be undertaken

<<<

 by anyone who has inside information, as defined in Section 3-2 o f the Norwegian Securities Trading Act. The same applies to the entry into, purchase, sale or exchange o f options or futures/forward contracts or equivalent rights whose value

<<<

 is connected to such financial instrum ents or incitem ent to such dispositions.
Mandatory offer requirement
The Norwegian Securities Trading Act requires any person, entity or consolidated group that becomes the owner of shares representing

<<<

 more than one-third o f the voting rights of a company listed on a Norwegian regulated market (with the exception o f certain foreign companies) to, within four weeks, make an unconditional general offer for the purchase o f the rem aining

<<<

 shares in that company. A mandatory offer obligation may also be triggered where a party acquires the right to becom e the ow ner o f shares that, to g eth er w ith the p arty 's ow n shareholding, represent m ore th an one-third o f the voting

<<<

 rights in the company and the Oslo Stock Exchange decides that this is regarded as an effective acquisition o f the shares in question.
The mandatory offer obligation ceases to apply if the person, entity or consolidated group sells the portion

<<<

 o f the shares that exceeds the relevant threshold within four weeks o f the date on which the mandatory offer obligation was triggered.
W hen a mandatory offer obligation is triggered, the person subject to the obligation is required to immediately

<<<

 notify the Oslo Stock Exchange and the com pany in question accordingly. The notification is required to state w hether an offer will be made to acquire the rem aining shares in the company or whether a sale will take place. As a rule, a notification

<<<

 to the effect that an offer will be made cannot be retracted. The offer and the offer document required are subject to approval by the Oslo Stock Exchange before the offer is submitted to the shareholders or made public.
The offer price per

<<<

 share must be at least as high as the highest price paid or agreed by the offeror (or a consolidated party) for the shares in the six-month period prior to the date the threshold was exceeded. If the acquirer acquires or agrees to acquire additional

<<<

 shares at a higher price prior to the expiration o f the mandatory offer period, the
79

acquirer is obliged to restate its offer at such higher price. A mandatory offer m ust be in cash or contain a cash alternative at least equivalent to

<<<

 any other consideration offered.
In case o f failure to make a mandatory offer or to sell the portion o f the shares that exceeds the relevant threshold w ithin four weeks, the Oslo Stock Exchange may force the acquirer to sell the shares exceeding

<<<

 the threshold by public auction. M oreover, a shareholder who fails to make an offer may not, as long as the m andatory offer obligation remains in force, exercise rights in the company, such as voting in a general meeting, without the consent

<<<

 o f a majority of the rem aining shareholders. The shareholder may, however, exercise its rights to dividends and pre-em ption rights in the event o f a share capital increase. If the shareholder neglects its duty to make a mandatory offer

<<<

, the Oslo Stock Exchange may impose a cumulative daily fine that runs until the circumstance has been rectified.
Any person, entity or consolidated group that owns shares representing more than one-third o f the votes in a company listed on

<<<

 a Norwegian regulated m arket (with the exception o f certain foreign companies) is obliged to make an offer to purchase the remaining shares o f the company (repeated offer obligation) if the person, entity or consolidated group through acquisition

<<<

 becomes the owner o f shares representing 40%, or more of the votes in the company. The same applies correspondingly if the person, entity or consolidated group through acquisition becomes the owner o f shares representing 50% or more o f the

<<<

 votes in the company. The mandatory offer obligation ceases to apply if the person, entity or consolidated group sells the portion of the shares w hich exceeds the relevant threshold w ithin four weeks o f the date on w hich the m andatory

<<<

 offer obligation was triggered.
Any person, entity or consolidated group that has passed any o f the above mentioned thresholds in such a way as not to trigger the mandatory bid obligation, and has therefore not previously made an offer for

<<<

 the remaining shares in the company in accordance w ith the mandatory offer rules is, as a m ain rule, obliged to make a m andatory offer in the event of a subsequent acquisition o f shares in the company.
Compulsory acquisition
Pursuant to

<<<

 the N orw egian Public Lim ited Companies Act and the N orw egian Securities Trading Act, a shareholder who, directly or through subsidiaries, acquires shares representing 90% or more o f the total number of issued shares in a Norwegian public

<<<

 lim ited liability company, as well as 90% or more o f the total voting rights, has a right, and each remaining minority shareholder o f the company has a right to require such majority shareholder, to effect a compulsory acquisition for cash

<<<

 of the shares not already owned by such majority shareholder. Through such compulsory acquisition the m ajority shareholder becom es the ow ner of the rem aining shares w ith im m ediate effect.
If a shareholder acquires shares representing

<<<

 more than 90% o f the total num ber o f issued shares, as well as more than 90% o f the total voting rights, through a voluntary offer in accordance w ith the Securities Trading Act, a compulsory acquisition can, subject to the following conditions

<<<

, be carried out w ithout such shareholder being obliged to make a m andatory offer: (i) the compulsory acquisition is com m enced no later than four weeks after the acquisition of shares through the voluntary offer; (ii) the price offered per

<<<

 share is equal to or higher than what the offer price w ould have been in a mandatory offer; and (iii) the settlement is guaranteed by a financial institution authorised to provide such guarantees in Norway.
A majority shareholder who effects

<<<

 a com pulsory acquisition is required to offer the minority shareholders a specific price per share, the determ ination o f w hich is at the discretion o f the majority shareholder. However, where the offeror, after making a mandatory or voluntary

<<<

 offer, has acquired more than 90% of the voting shares o f a company and a corresponding proportion o f the votes that can be cast at the general meeting, and the offeror pursuant to Section 4-25 of the N orwegian Public Limited Companies Act

<<<

 completes a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares within three months after the expiry o f the offer period, it follows from the N orw egian Securities Trading Act that the redem ption price shall be determined on the basis o f the

<<<

 offer price for the mandatory/voluntary offer unless specific reasons indicate another price.
Should any minority shareholder not accept the offered price, such minority shareholder may, within a specified deadline o f not less than two months

<<<

, request that the price be set by a N orw egian court. The cost o f such court procedure will, as a general rule, be the responsibility o f the majority shareholder, and the relevant court will have full discretion in determining the consideration

<<<

 to be paid to the minority shareholder as a result o f the compulsory acquisition.
Absent a request for a N orwegian court to set the price or any other objection to the price being offered, the minority shareholders would be deemed to have

<<<

 accepted the offered price after the expiry o f the specified deadline.
Foreign exchange controls
There are currently no foreign exchange control restrictions in Norway that would potentially restrict the paym ent o f dividends to a shareholder

<<<

 outside Norway, and there are currently no restrictions that would affect the right
80

o f shareholders o f a company that has its shares registered w ith the VPS who are not residents in Norway to dispose of their shares and receive the

<<<

 proceeds from a disposal outside Norway. There is no m axim um transferable am ount either to or from Norway, although transferring banks are required to submit reports on foreign currency exchange transactions into and out o f Norway into

 or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction Security as they see fit, provided that the instructions as to enforcement given by the Instructing Group are Qualifying Instructions

.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Transaction Security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and, in each

<<<

 case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security which the Majority Subordinated Creditors are then entitled to

<<<

 give to the Security Agent as described under the caption "--R estrictions R elating to Subordinated Creditors and Subordinated L iabilities'" above, p ro v id e d that the instructions as to enforcement given by the Majority Subordinated Creditors

<<<

 are Qualifying Instructions, p ro v id e d fu rth e r that, if an Instructing Group gives (at that time or subsequently) Qualifying Instructions, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with such Qualifying Instructions, and provided fu

 rth er that the Majority Subordinated Creditors shall only be entitled to give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain or cease from enforcing Transaction Security to the extent such Transaction Security is expressed to secure

 the Subordinated Liabilities.

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, or have any independent power to exercise any rights or powers

<<<

 arising under the security documents, or may enforce any Transaction Security, except through the Security Agent in a manner contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement.

M anner o fEnforcement

If the Transaction Security is being enforced

<<<

 as set forth above under the caption "--E nforcem ent Instructions," the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator, examiner or equivalent officer

<<<

 of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

(i)

an Instructing Group; or

(ii) prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third paragraph under the caption "-- E nforcem ent o f Security

<<<

" above, given effect to instructions given by the Majority Subordinated Creditors to enforce the Transaction Security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the Transaction Security, the

<<<

 Majority Subordinated Creditors,

shall instruct (provided that any such instructions are consistent with certain "security enforcement principles," as set out below) or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit

<<<

, in each case, taking into account the requirements of each relevant security document and the "security enforcement principles," as set out below.

109

Security Enforcement Principles

The following is a summary of the "security enforcement

<<<

 principles", which are set out in the Intercreditor Agreement:

(a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to achieve the "Security Enforcement Objective". The "Security Enforcement Objective

<<<

" means maximizing, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from an enforcement of the Transaction Security, recovery by the Primary Creditors.

(b) The security enforcement principles may be amended, varied

<<<

 or waived with the prior written consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that no additional obligations may be imposed on a member of the Group without the consent of the Parent.



<<<

(c) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to enforcement will be taken such that either:

i.

all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance

with the provisions

<<<

 set out under the caption "--A pplication o f P roceeds-- O rder o f A pplication" (the

"Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall"); or

ii.

in the event that the Majority Senior Secured Creditors are issuing instructions as to the enforcement of


<<<


the Transaction Security, sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent

in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Enforcement Proceeds

Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities

<<<

 are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super

Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(d) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

, the time frame for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal will be determined by the Instructing Group, provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(e

<<<

) On:

i.

a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member of

the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds 5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or

ii.

a proposed enforcement

<<<

 of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member

of the Group over which transaction security exists,

the Security Agent shall, upon instruction from the Instructing Group (unless it is incompatible with enforcement

<<<

 proceedings in a relevant jurisdiction) appoint an internationally recognized investment bank or a "big four" accounting firm or other reputable, third-party independent professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations of

<<<

 businesses or assets, in each case as selected by the Security Agent acting reasonably and in good faith (an "Advisor"), to opine as expert that the proceeds received from any such enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking

<<<

 into account all relevant circumstances (including the method of enforcement) (an "Advisor's Opinion").

(f)

The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint an Advisor or to seek the advice of an Advisor,

unless expressly required

<<<

 to do so by these security enforcement principles or any other provision of the

Intercreditor Agreement.

(g) The Advisor's Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other enforcement of the Transaction

<<<

 Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.

(h) Where the Instructing Group is the

<<<

 Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may waive the requirement for an Advisor's Opinion where sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds

<<<

 are applied in accordance with the Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full.

(i)

In the event that an enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to in


<<<


paragraph (e)(i) or (e)(ii) above and such enforcement is conducted by way of "public auction", the Super

110

Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors shall be entitled to participate in such auction on the basis of equal inform

<<<

 ation and access rights as oth er bidders and financiers in the auction. N othing in this p aragraph (i) shall require enforcem ent o f the Transaction Security to take place by way o f public auction.

(j)

In the absence of w ritten notice

<<<

 from a secured party or group o f secured parties that are not part o f the relevant

Instructing Group that such secured part(y/ies) object to any enforcem ent o f the Transaction Security on the

grounds that such Enforcem ent A ction does

<<<

 not aim to achieve the Security Enforcem ent Objective (an

"Objection"), the Security A gent is entitled to assum e that such enforcem ent o f the T ransaction Security is in

accordance w ith the Security Enforcem ent Objective.

(k)

If

<<<

 the Security Agent receives an O bjection (and without prejudice to the ability o f the Security Agent to rely on

other advisers and/or exercise its ow n ju d g m en t in accordance w ith the Intercreditor A greem ent), a n A d v iso r's


<<<


O pinion (or any equivalent opinion referred to in paragraph (g) above) to the effect that the particular action

could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive

evidence that the requirem

<<<

 ent o f paragraph (a) above has been met.

Exercise o f Voting Rights

To the fullest extent perm itted under applicable law, each creditor (other than any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Senior Notes Trustee) agrees w ith the Security Agent

<<<

 that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect o f any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or sim ilar proceedings relating to any m em ber

<<<

 o f the G roup as instructed by the Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes o f this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group. N otw ithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this paragraph entitles any

<<<

 party to exercise or require any other creditor under the Intercreditor Agreem ent to exercise its pow er o f voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for paym ent or otherwise reschedule any o f the liabilities

<<<

 owed to that creditor.

Waiver o fRights

To the extent perm itted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions o f the Intercreditor Agreement, each o f the Secured Parties and the D ebtors waives all rights it may otherwise have

<<<

 to require that the Transaction Security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcem ent o f any o f the Transaction Security or

<<<

 o f any other security interest, w hich is capable o f being applied in or towards discharge o f any o f the secured obligations, is so applied.

Security H eld by Other Creditors

If any Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than

<<<

 the Security Agent, then that creditor may only enforce that security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing G roup pursuant to the terms o f the Intercreditor Agreem ent (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent

<<<

 shall be construed as references to that creditor).

Duties Owed

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each o f the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce

<<<

, the Transaction Security prior to the Senior D ischarge Date, the duties o f the Security Agent and o f any receiver or delegate owed to the Secured Parties in respect o f the method, type and tim ing o f that enforcem ent or o f the exploitation

<<<

, m anagem ent or realization o f any o f that security shall be no different to or greater than the duty that is ow ed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law.

<<<



The Security Agent agrees and is irrevocably authorized and instructed that it shall (at the request and cost o f the Parent) promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(i)

any security (and/or any other claim

<<<

 relating to a D ebt D ocum ent) over any asset w hich is the subject of:

(a)

a disposal not prohibited by the terms o f the D ebt Financing A greem ents (including a disposal to a

m em ber o f the Group, but without prejudice to any obligation

<<<

 o f any m em ber o f the Group in a Debt

(iv) any security (and/or any other claim relating

<<<

 to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company

<<<

 of any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor, the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) shall (at the request

is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(ii) in the case of any release requested pursuant to

<<<

 paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

<<<

 such other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release or other matter described in the paragraph above.

If any member of the Group is required or not prohibited under the Senior Debt Documents, to

<<<

 apply the proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of the Permitted Super Senior Financing Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or the

<<<

 Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities (as applicable) then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or Subordinated Creditor or will result in any breach of any Subordinated Finance Document and any

<<<

 such application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Subordinated Liabilities.

Distressed Disposals

Generally, a "Distressed Disposal" is a disposal

<<<

 of an asset of a member of the Group which is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where Transaction Security has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b

<<<

) being effected by enforcement of Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or (c) being effected, after the occurrence of a Distress Event, by a Debtor to a person or persons which is not a member

<<<

 or Debtor):

(i)

to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Debtors and Agents;
(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor and the

<<<

 Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company

<<<

:
(a) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the "Transferee") will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for

<<<

 the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities; provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document,

<<<

 the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and
(b) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any Transferee

<<<

 will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of: all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors

<<<

 and all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,
on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors and Debtors;
(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company

<<<

 of a Debtor (the "Disposed Entity") and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the "Receiving Entity") all or any part of the Disposed Entity's obligations or any obligations

<<<

 of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-Group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:
(a) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of

<<<

 those intra-Group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-Group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and
(b) (if the Receiving Entity is

<<<

 a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-Group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving

<<<

 Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-Group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be transferred.
The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities

<<<

 or Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption "--Application o fProceeds'"as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security

<<<

 and, to
113

the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by, or at the request of

<<<

, the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation

<<<

 to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities in relation to a member of the Group would otherwise be released

<<<

 pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect (subject to certain conditions) to have those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or, as the case may be, other liabilities transferred to the

<<<

 Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or

<<<

 Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those liabilities.

If prior to the Subordinated Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the guarantees of the Senior Notes and the guarantees

<<<

 of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or any Transaction Security over the assets of a Subordinated Debt Issuer, any Senior Guarantor or any Junior Guarantor will be released and/or any Subordinated Liabilities will be released, it is a further

<<<

 by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale; p r o

<<<

 v id e d that, if each Senior Agent (acting reasonably and in good faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates

<<<

 and not released or discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

(c) such

<<<

 sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate; or

 beyond its distributable reserves (free equity) and then further provided that satisfactory security for repaym ent/ recovery has been established. This restriction does not, however, apply to any granting o f credit to or security/guarantee

<<<

 for the obligations o f a parent company or another com pany w ithin the sam e "group" . This exem ption m ust b e read in conjunction w ith the group definition in Section 1-3 o f the Acts which, broadly speaking, includes N orw egian lim

<<<

 ited liability companies. Furthermore, there is an exem ption for the granting o f credit to or security/guarantee for the obligations o f any other legal entity (or the subsidiary o f such other legal entity) w hich has such a decisive influence

<<<

 over the com pany as m entioned in Section 1-3 o f the A cts provided that the credit, security or guarantee is established in order to benefit the financial interests o f the group o f com panies. Section 1-3 defines decisive influence as

<<<

 holding at least such num ber o f shares in the com pany w hich represents a majority of the votes in the company or has the right to elect or discharge a majority of the members of the board o f directors o f such company. In practice, this

<<<

 exception w ill therefore be applicable to a N orw egian wholly-owned subsidiary o f a foreign company, provided that the guarantee is established in order to benefit the financial interests o f the group o f companies.
As a consequence o f

<<<

 these restrictions, the value o f the Guarantees and any security provided by a Norwegian guarantor may be reduced to zero to the extent it secured obligations relating to the acquisition o f shares in itself or its parent company. In addition

<<<

, the Guarantees or security interest infringing the limitations set forth in Section 8-10 and 8-7 o f the Acts will be void, and any funds paid out will have to be repaid. Finally, an illegal arrangem ent o f this kind may give rise to directors

<<<

' liability issues. As a general rule under N orw egian law, the board o f directors o f a Norwegian private or public limited liability company has a fiduciary duty to act in the interest o f the company. Thus, the board of directors o f a

<<<

 company is only perm itted to resolve to guarantee the obligations o f another group com pany to the extent this is in the interest o f the company. This means that the board o f directors in each case must carefully evaluate whether the benefits

<<<

 to it from guaranteeing the obligations o f such other company equals or outweighs the obligations o f the same.
The Guarantees and the Security Interests provided by N orw egian companies are subject to lim itation language substantially in

<<<

 the form as follows:
"The obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor incorporated in Norway in its capacity as a Guarantor (each a "N orw egian G u a ra n to r") shall not cover any indebtedness or liability which, if they did so extend,

<<<

 would cause an infringem ent o f section 8-10 and/or section 8-7 cf. section 1-3, or any o f the other provisions in chapter 8 III, o f the N orw egian Private Lim ited Companies Act 1997 (the "N orw egian C om panies A ct") regulating unlawful

<<<

 financial assistance and other prohibited loans, guarantees and jo in t and several liability as well as providing o f security, and it is understood and agreed that the liability o f any Norwegian Guarantor only applies to the extent perm

<<<

 itted by the above-m entioned provisions o f the N orw egian Companies Act. U nder no circum stances shall the obligations and liabilities o f any Norwegian Guarantor cover the debt and/or other liabilities incurred in respect o f the purchase

<<<

 o f the shares in such N orw egian G uarantor o r the shares in any o f such N o rw eg ian G u aran to r's H olding C om panies."
207

The lim itations set fo rth in section 8-10 and/or section 8- 7 cf. section 1-3 o f the A cts w ill apply

 m utatis mutandis to any security created by a N orw egian Guarantor under the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral and to any guarantee, indemnity, any sim ilar obligation resulting in a paym ent obligation and payment, including, but not lim ited

 to, set-off, pursuant to the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral and made by any N orw egian Guarantor. Such limitations on the liabilities and obligations o f any N orw egian Guarantor may have the effect o f reducing the amount o f obligations

<<<

 or liabilities assum ed and/or the amount guaranteed or secured to zero, to the extent to w hich any proceeds under the Notes are used in connection w ith the acquisition o f shares in the Norw egian Guarantor or its parent).
Insolvency
N orw

<<<

 egian insolvency legislation is regulated by the N orw egian Bankruptcy Act o f June 8, 1984 No. 58 (Konkursloven) (the "B a n k ru p tc y A ct"), w hich sets forth the various procedures to be follow ed both in the case of court-adm inistered

<<<

 debt negotiations and bankruptcy proceedings, and the Creditors Recovery A ct o f June 8, 1984 No. 59 (Dekningsloven) (the "R ecovery A ct") containing provisions on, am ong other things, the priority o f claims.
The key features o f the N

<<<

 orw egian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal o f the d eb to r's assets, (ii) the assessm ent and ranking o f claim s, (iii) the testing and revocation o f transactions (including the securing o f existing claim

<<<

 s) m ade p rio r to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling o f the d eb to r's contractual relationships and (v) the distribution o f funds (if any) in accordance w ith the priority rules. If the business operations o f the bankrupt company are continued

<<<

, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors.
Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. B oth the debtor (by the representation o f the Board o f Directors

<<<

) and the creditors (holding or pretending to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy.
There are two requirements for a debtor to be deem ed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debt as it becom es due, such paym ent

<<<

 difficulties not being o f a tem porary nature and (ii) the debtor m ust be in "deficit" (the com pany's debts m ust exceed the sum o f its assets and revenue, b ased o n real, n ot b ook, values).
D uring bankruptcy proceedings the d e b to

<<<

 r's assets are controlled by the court-appointed liquidator (usually a law yer), o n b e h a lf o f the bankruptcy estate. The m ain task o f the liquidator is to tu rn all the d e b to r's assets into cash in the m anner assumed to be m ost

<<<

 profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors.
A ll o f the d e b to r's assets w ill in practice b e seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the d eb to r m ay n ot dispose o f the

<<<

 seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third-parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner, or if the acquisition lacks legal

<<<

 protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, w hich is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights w ith respect to the seized assets, including

<<<

, but not lim ited to, the realization o f assets.
Secured creditors are, in principle, not deem ed to be part o f the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value o f the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations o f the

<<<

 debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover their claims; however, keeping in m ind that the realization of a num ber o f categories of security during the first six m onths after the opening o f a bankruptcy

<<<

 will be subject to the approval o f the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security w ith a w iping

<<<

 out effect on unm et liens and divide the proceeds betw een the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets.
Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien o f up to 5% of the estim ated value or sales value

<<<

 of all assets secured by the debtor fo r its ow n debt o r by a third-party fo r the d e b to r's indebtedness. Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the

<<<

 Norwegian Financial Collateral Act No. 17/2004 (the "F inancial C o llateral A ct") or the N orw egian Liens Act No. 2/1980 section 6-4 (9).
A ny under-secured am ount (any am ount exceeding the value o f the assets securing the relevant c

<<<

 re d ito r's claim ) will be deem ed an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim.
In a N orwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:
 secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value o f

<<<

 the secured asset-- either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate);
208

 super-priority claim s (claim s that arise d uring the bankruptcy proceedings, liq u id ato r

<<<

's costs and obligations of the estate);
 salary claims (within certain limitations);
 tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations);
 ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated,

<<<

 including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims); and
 subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).
Pursuant

<<<

 to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the three to twelve m onth period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening

<<<

 of the bankruptcy proceedings, such as extraordinary paym ents of certain creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an undervalue. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside

<<<

 o r reverse transactions m ade in b ad faith o r negligently w hich in an im proper m anner increase the d e b to r's debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets w hich may otherwise have served

<<<

 to cover the creditors' claims, in w hich case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years.
Solvent enforcement
Enforcement o f security normally requires that the pledgee or chargee files an application to the enforcement

<<<

 authorities for the enforcement o f the security. Certain types o f security may, however, be enforced without the involvem ent o f the enforcem ent authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial Collateral A

<<<

 ct and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured party such right o f enforcement is typically included in any security agreem ent betw een the pledgor/chargor and the secured party.
Enforcement of a guarantee claim against

<<<

 a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding judgm ent by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcem ent

<<<

 o f his or her claim against the assets o f the guarantor.
Creation and enforcement o f security
Norwegian law provides fo r effectively creating security over a range o f closely defined asset types (a floating charge may be established over

<<<

 certain asset types of a Norwegian company).
As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcem ent situation and agreements on enforcem ent cannot validly be entered into prior to the

<<<

 occurrence o f an event o f default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the N orw egian courts and/or the Norwegian enforcem ent authorities. However, this is different for shares in a N orwegian lim ited company. If the secured party

<<<

 is a financial institution, the shares are considered financial collateral, and the parties are free (within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process in the share pledge agreement.
Also, fo r specific security assets, and under

<<<

 certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may

<<<

 instruct the relevant debtor to pay the outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of the chargor.
The concept o f a security trustee, as it is understood under com m on law, does not exist under N orw egian law. In practice

<<<

, in an arrangem ent w ith a security agent acting on behalf o f the secured parties, as these exist from tim e to time, it is generally recognized under N orw egian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf

<<<

 o f the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcem ent purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the security agent may, however, be required to disclose

<<<

 to the court the identity o f the creditors and have the creditors jo in in or participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond trustee for an undisclosed num ber o f bondholders

<<<

 can, based on the provisions in the bond agreement, take legal action against the issuer on behalf o f and in lieu o f the bondholders and w ithout having to disclose the entity o f the bondholders.

 to holders o f the QSF Exchange Notes. References to the holders o f the QSF Exchange Notes below include the holders o f the Notes acting through, or in place of, the Issuer w ith respect to the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral.
French laws and

<<<

 proceedings affecting creditors include debt rescheduling pursuant to Articles 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil), m andat ad hoc proceedings (mandats ad hoc), conciliation proceedings (procedure de conciliation), safeguard

<<<

 proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde acceleree), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde financiere acceleree) and judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings

<<<

 (redressement or liquidation judiciaire). In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation o f a business and the protection o f em ploym ent over the paym ent o f creditors.
U nder the EU Insolvency Regulation, French courts

Grace periods
In addition to the pre-insolvency and insolvency laws discussed below, the holders o f the Notes could, like any other creditors, be subject to Articles 1244-1 et seq. o f the French Civil Code (Code civil).
Pursuant to Articles

<<<

 1244-1 et seq. o f the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor, taking into account the d e b to r's financial p o sitio n an d the cred ito r's financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule

<<<

 the paym ent dates o f paym ent obligations over a maxim um period o f two years and decide that any amounts, the paym ent date o f w hich is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is low er than the contractual rate

<<<

 (but not lower than the legal rate published twice a year by order o f the M inistry o f Economy) or that payments made shall first be allocated to the repaym ent o f principal. If a court order under Articles 1244-1 et seq. o f the French

<<<

 Civil Code is made, it will suspend any pending enforcem ent measures, and any contractual interest or penalty fo r late paym ent will not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the court. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace

<<<

 periods. W hen the debtor benefits from a conciliation proceeding, these statutory provisions shall be read in com bination w ith A rticle L .611-7 o f the F rench C om m ercial Code (see "-- C onciliation P ro c e e d in g s").

U nder French law, a com pany is considered to be insolvent (en etat de cessation des paiem ents) w hen it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due w ith its available assets taking into account available credit lines and debt m oratoria

<<<

 w hich its creditors have granted to it.
Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings
A French company facing difficulties without being insolvent (or for less than 45 days in the case o f conciliation proceedings) may request the opening o f

<<<

 court-assisted proceedings (m andat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim o f w hich is to reach a n agreem ent w ith the d e b to r's m ain creditors and stakeholders e.g. agreem ent to reduce o r reschedule its indebtedness. These proceedings

<<<

 may only be initiated by the debtor com pany itself, in its sole discretion. M andat ad hoc and conciliation are informal and confidential (subject to the below) proceedings carried out under the aegis o f a court-appointed officer (mandataire

<<<

 ad hoc or conciliateur, whose name can be suggested by the debtor) itself under the supervision o f the President o f the relevant court (usually the Commercial Court), w hich do not involve any stay o f the claims nor pending proceedings.

<<<

 As a consequence, creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they usually accept to do so for the duration o f the proceedings. In any event, the debtor retains the right

<<<

 to petition the relevant judge for a grace period (in conciliation proceedings the President o f the court), as set forth above and below. In conciliation proceedings, the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliator (Article

<<<

 L. 611-7 o f the French Commercial Code).
210

M andat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request o f the debtor and after the opinion o f the participating creditors has been sought to prepare the sale o f all or

<<<

 part o f the business o f the debtor w ith a view to im plem ent such sale (plan de cession) in a subsequent insolvency proceeding. To ensure transparency, the public prosecutor must be consulted on any offer formalized in the context o f such

<<<

 conciliation proceeding.
Contractual provisions modifying the term s o f an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations o f the debtor solely by reason o f the appointment o f a mandataire ad hoc or the opening

<<<

 o f conciliation proceedings, or any request made to this end are deem ed null and void.
Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result o f the opening o f a m andat ad hoc proceedings or the opening o f conciliation proceedings

<<<

, m ake the d ebtor b e a r the fees o f the c red ito r's counsel relating to such proceedings for the portion that would exceed three quarters o f the total fee o f the relevant counsel are null and void.
Mandat ad hoc proceedings
French law

<<<

 does not provide for any specific rule in respect o f m andat ad hoc proceedings, except that these proceedings (i) are confidential by law (save for their disclosure for statutory auditors if any) and (ii) may only be initiated by the debtor

<<<

 com pany itself, in its sole discretion. M andat ad hoc proceedings are not lim ited in time and are informal proceedings carried out under the supervision o f the president o f the relevant court (usually the Commercial Court), w hich do not

<<<

 involve any stay o f the proceedings.
A company that is facing any type o f difficulties (but w hich is not insolvent (en cessation des paiem ents); see "-- Insolvency Test" above) may request from the President o f the court the appointm ent

<<<

 o f a mandataire ad hoc, whose name it can suggest. The mandataire ad hoc's duties are determ ined by the court. Such mandataire ad hoc is usually appointed in order to facilitate negotiations w ith the debtor's m ain creditors but he cannot

<<<

 coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal. The agreem ent reached by the parties (if any) w ith the help o f such mandataire ad hoc can be reported by the latter to the president o f the court but is not approved by the court. The restructuring

<<<

 agreem ent betw een the company and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement.
Conciliation proceedings
A French company may

<<<

, in its sole discretion, apply for the opening o f conciliation proceedings, provided it (i) is not insolvent (see "--Insolvency Test" above), or has been insolvent for few er than 45 days and (ii) experiences current or predictable legal,

<<<

 economic or financial difficulties. The debtor petitions the president o f the Commercial Court for the appointment o f a conciliator (whose name it can suggest) in charge o f assisting the debtor in negotiating w ith some or all o f its creditors

<<<

 and/or trade partners an agreem ent that puts an end to its difficulties, providing e.g. for the restructuring o f its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings are confidential (subject to the below) and may last up to five months. D uring the

<<<

 proceedings, creditors may continue to sue individually for paym ent o f their claims but they usually in practice accept not to do so. In addition, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge having opened the conciliation proceedings

<<<

 for a grace period.
W ith regard to the grace periods under Articles 1244-1 o f the French Civil Code, the judge having opened conciliation proceedings (i) may grant a grace period even w hen the form al notice asking the debtor to pay w as

W hile the conciliation agreement (whether acknowledged or approved) is being implemented, by law (i) any individual proceedings

 by creditors w ith respect to the claims included in the conciliation agreem ent are suspended, (ii) accrued interest o f the claims governed by the conciliation agreem ent cannot bear them selves interest (notwithstanding Article 1154 o f

 specific consequences:
 creditors who provided new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation o f the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) in the course of conciliation proceedings

 leading to an approved conciliation agreement or in application of an approved conciliation agreement will have priority o f paym ent over all pre-proceeding and post-proceeding claims (other than certain pre-proceeding em ploym ent claims

 and post-proceeding procedural costs) (the "New M oney L ien"), in the event o f subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; and
 in the event o f subsequent safeguard proceedings

 by the court as o f a date earlier than the date on w hich the approval of the agreem ent by the court has become final, except in case o f fraud.
Joint debtors, personal guarantors, or any third-party that granted a security interest can benefit

<<<

 from the grace periods granted to the debtor during conciliation proceedings as well as from the provisions o f the approved or acknowledged agreement.
In the event o f a breach o f the conciliation agreement, any party to the agreem ent can

<<<

 petition the court for its termination. The commencement o f subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in w hich case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests, except

<<<

 amounts already paid to them.
Conciliation proceedings, in the context o f which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large majority o f creditors without reaching unanimity, will be a mandatory preliminary step o f the accelerated

<<<

 safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.
Court-administered proceedings--safeguard, accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, reorganization and liquidation proceedings

<<<


Court-adm inistered proceedings may be initiated:
 in the event o f safeguard proceedings, upon petition by the debtor only (for accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below); and
 in

<<<

 the event o f judicial reorganization or liquidation, upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public prosecutor.
Opening
The debtor may file for safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings at any

<<<

 time it is facing difficulties that it cannot overcome. Regular safeguard proceedings can only be opened, if the debtor is not insolvent (en etat de cessation des paiem ents) whereas accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial

<<<

 safeguard proceedings may be opened as long as it was not insolvent for more than 45 days w hen it initially requested the opening o f conciliation.
It is required to petition for the opening o f judicial reorganization proceedings (if recovery

<<<

 is possible) or judicial liquidation proceedings (if recovery is manifestly not possible) within 45 days of the date upon which the insolvency (cessation des paiem ents) occurred. If it fails to do so (or if it fails to file for conciliation

<<<

 alternatively), its directors and officers may be subject to civil liability. Creditors o f the company do not attend the hearing before the court
212

at w hich the opening o f safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard

<<<

 proceedings is requested. The same applies for the hearing before the court at which the opening o f reorganization or liquidation proceedings is requested, save for the creditor having requested it, as the case m ay be.
O bservation p erio

 d --ju d ic ia l bodies
The period from the date o f the court decision commencing the proceedings (w hether a safeguard or a judicial reorganization) to the date on w hich the court takes a decision on the outcome o f the proceedings is called

<<<

 the "observation period" and m ay last up to 18 m onths.
During the observation period, a court-appointed administrator, whose name can be suggested by the debtor in safeguard proceedings, investigates the business of the company.
In safeguard

<<<

 proceedings, the adm inistrato r's m ission is lim ited to either supervising o r assisting the d e b to r's management and assisting it in preparing a safeguard plan for the company.
In ju d icial reorganization proceedings, the adm in istrato

<<<

 r's m ission is usually to assist the m anagem ent and to make proposals for the reorganization o f the company, w hich may include a business continuation plan (equivalent to a safeguard plan) and/or the sale o f all o r p art o f the co m

<<<

 p an y 's business to a third-party. In ju d icial reorganization, the court m ay also decide that the adm inistrator w ill m anage the com pany alone b y replacing the d e b to r's m anagem ent.
Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the

<<<

 relief o f the debtor o f the m anagem ent and there is no observation period in such proceedings. The outcome o f liquidation proceedings, w hich is decided by the court w ithout a vote o f the creditors, m ay be a sale o f the business p

 lan and/o r isolated sales o f the d e b to r's assets in order to discharge the d eb to r's liabilities. W here a sale o f the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a temporary continuation o f the business for

<<<

 a maxim um period o f three months (renewable once for a period o f three m onths at the Public P ro secu to r's request) w hose effects are sim ilar to an observation period.
End o fproceedings
At the end o f the observation period, if the

<<<

 Court considers that the company can survive as a going concern, it will adopt a safeguard or reorganization plan w hich will entail a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts and may entail the divestiture o f som e o r all o f the d e b

 to r's assets and businesses (a sale o f the entire business is not possible in a safeguard plan).
At any time during the observation period, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) at the debtors

 who filed a proof o f claim, regarding the debt rescheduling or write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps proposed.
The French Commercial Code does not state w hether the proposals for settlement can vary according to the creditor. According to legal

<<<

 commentaries, in the absence o f a specific legislative prohibition, varying treatm ent of creditors should in theory be possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position o f the creditors. In practice, it is
213

also possible

<<<

 to make alternative proposals at the consultation stage (which generally breaks dow n into a short-term option, w ith debt remissions and rapid payment o f the balance, and a long-term option, w ith 100% repayment o f the debts o v er 10 years

<<<

, the courts tend to im pose a long-term solution).
Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved or upon adm ission o f their claims may not be consulted.
In the event

<<<

 o f a consultation in writing, if a creditor does not respond within 30 days from receipt of the letter from the creditors' representative, such creditor is deem ed to have accepted the debt rescheduling and/or write-off. However, w ith respect

<<<

 to debt-to-equity swap proposals, the creditors' representatives m ust obtain the agreem ent o f each individual creditor in writing. The creditors' representative keeps a list o f the responses from creditors, w hich is notified to the debtor

<<<

, the administrator and the monitors.
W ithin the fram ew ork o f an ordinary consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were subm itted to them, the court that approves the safeguard or reorganisation plan can only impose uniform

<<<

 debt deferrals over a m axim um period o f 10 years (it bein g noted that debts w hose m aturity dates exceed the du ratio n o f the p lan are not concerned and their maturity dates shall rem ain the same). Any debt w rite-off or debt-to-equity

<<<

 swap is contingent on individual acceptance.
The first payment must be made within a year o f the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the am ount o f each annual instalm ent m ust be o f at least 5% o f the total

<<<

 am ount o f each adm itted debt claims).
Committee-based consultation: For debtors who meet the aforementioned criteria, or for debtors who do not but w ith the authorization o f the supervisory judge, the court-appointed adm inistrator sets

<<<

 up two creditors' committees, on the basis o f the debts that arose prior to the opening judgm ent: one for credit institutions (or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor o f the debtor, or the assignees

<<<

 of such claim or of a claim acquired from a supplier), and the other for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% o f the total amount o f the claims o f all the d eb to r's suppliers. T hese com m ittees w ill b e consulted o

<<<

 n the safeguard o r reorganisation p lan drafted by the d eb to r's m anagem ent w ith the assistance o f the ju d icial adm inistrator during the observation period. In addition, any m em ber o f a committee may submit an alternative safeguard

 or reorganisation plan to the debtor and the court-appointed adm inistrator it being specified that these alternative plans are subject (i) to the preparation o f a report fo r each alternative plan from the adm inistrator and (ii) to the same

<<<

 two-thirds m ajority vote in each com m ittee and by a two-thirds majority vote o f the general meeting o f the holders o f the Notes (although the holders o f the Notes are not perm itted to present their ow n alternative plan) for their approval

<<<

.
The com m ittees m ust vote o n the safeguard o r reorganisation p la n w ithin a m inim um o f 15 days o f its submission. The plan must be approved by a vote o f each committee, constituting a two-thirds majority o f the claims of the creditors

<<<

 casting a vote. The amounts o f the claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted as security interest by the debtor are not taken into account. In addition, creditors fo r whom the plan does not provide any m odification o f their repaym ent

<<<

 schedule or provides for a paym ent o f their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are adm itted do not take part in the vote.
If there are any holders o f the Notes, they are required to vote on

<<<

 the plan during a general meeting o f all holders o f the Notes held for that purpose and approve the plan at the same two-thirds majority vote. Approval o f the plan at the two-thirds majority shall, if the plan is approved by the court, bind

<<<

 all the members o f the committees and the holders of the Notes (including those who voted against the adoption o f the plan). The plan subm itted to the committees and the general m eeting o f the holders o f the Notes, if any, must take into

<<<

 account subordination agreem ents entered into by the creditors before the commencement o f the proceedings, may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation and may notably include debt rescheduling or write

<<<

-offs, and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).
Each creditor m em ber o f a creditors committee and each note holder must, if applicable, inform the judicial administrator o f the existence

<<<

 o f any agreement w hich makes the exercise o f its vote subject to any conditions or whose purpose is the full or total paym ent by a third-party o f its claim as well as o f any subordination agreement. The judicial adm inistrator shall then

<<<

 submit to the creditor/note holder a proposal fo r the com putation o f its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event o f a disagreement, the creditor/note holder or the judicial administrator may request

<<<

 that the m atter be decided by the president o f the applicable court in summary proceedings (en refere).
If, the creditors' com m ittees and the general m eeting o f the holders o f the Notes approve the plan, and subject to verification by

<<<

 the court that the interests o f all creditors are sufficiently safeguarded and to a potential rescheduling of the claims o f creditors who are not m embers o f the comm ittees or o f the general meeting o f the holders o f the Notes (as discussed

<<<

 hereinafter), the court will approve the plan.
214

For those creditors outside the creditors' committee or the general meeting o f the holders o f the Notes, they are consulted following the "ordinary" consultation process (see above).
In

<<<

 the event that the debtor com pany's proposed safeguard o r reorganisation p lan is no t approved b y b o th committees and the general meeting of holders o f the Notes within the first six months o f the observation period (it being noted

<<<

 that this 6 month period may be extended by the court at the request o f the judicial adm inistrator to the extent it does not exceed the duration o f the observation period), either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject

<<<

 it, the court can still adopt a safeguard or reorganisation plan in the tim e rem aining until the end o f the observation period. In such a case the rules are the same as those applicable to creditors who are not part o f the committees and

<<<

 who are not holders o f the Notes (see the "ordinary" consultation described above). The administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement o f debts to the court-appointed creditors' representative, who, individually or collectively,

<<<

 obtains the agreement o f each creditor who filed a proof o f claim, regarding the debt rescheduling o r write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps proposed. If the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to them, the court that approves

<<<

 the safeguard o n reorganization p lan can only im pose uniform debt deferrals over a m axim um p eriod o f 10 years. Any d eb t w rite-o ff or debt-to-equity swap is contingent on individual acceptance.
Creditors for w hom the plan does not

<<<

 provide any am endm ent to their repaym ent term s or provides for a full repayment in cash of their claims as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted do not need to be consulted on the plan.
The creditors' representative

<<<

 in insolvency proceedings can summon a shareholder to pay any outstanding amount due over the shares he subscribed.
The opening judgm ent o f insolvency proceedings leads to the immediate maturity o f the amount not paid up of the share capital

<<<

.
W hen the court mandates the adm inistrator to convene the shareholder general meetings, in order to vote on the modifications o f the articles o f association provided by the plan, the adm inistrator may decide that the general meeting will

<<<

 rule on first convening, by the majority o f the votes held by the shareholders attending the meeting or represented at the meeting, provided that said shareholders hold at least half the shares with voting rights. O n second convening, the

<<<

 com m on law provisions relating to the quorum and m ajority requirements shall apply.
In reorganization proceedings, if the equity capital o f the debtor is lower than half o f the share capital and has not been restored, the administrator

<<<

 may request the Court to appoint a trustee (mandataire en justice) to convene the shareholders m eeting and to vote in place o f the shareholders refusing to vote to restore the sh areh o ld er's equity if the plan provides for a m odification

<<<

 o f the share capital to the benefit o f any third-party undertaking to comply with the recovery plan.
In addition, Law n2015-990 dated 6 August 2015, entitled "M acron Law", has introduced a new provision (Article L.631-19-2 o f the French

<<<

 Com m ercial Code) applicable to judicial reorganization proceedings opened as from August 7, 2015, in the cases where (i) a debtor (a) employs at least 150 em ployees or (b) is a dom inant com pany (within the m eaning o f article L.2331-

<<<

1 o f the French Labour Code) o f one or more companies w ith at least 150 employees in aggregate, (ii) the disappearance o f such debtor is likely to cause serious disturbance to the national or local economy and to local employment, and (iii

<<<

) a share capital m odification appears - after review o f total or partial transfer plan solutions - the only credible solution to avoid such a disturbance and to allow the d eb to r's business activities to continue. In summary, if, in such

<<<

 event, a reorganization plan provides for a m odification o f the share capital in favour o f one or more person(s) who undertake to im plem ent the plan and the existing shareholders refuse to vote such share capital modification, the court

<<<

 may, under certain procedural and substantial conditions (e.g. the paym ent to the evicted shareholders o f an amount corresponding to the value o f their shares, as determ ined by a court appointed expert if no agreement as to such value is

<<<

 reached am ong the parties) and upon request o f the court-appointed administrator or the public prosecutor, either (a) appoint a trustee (m andataire) to vote in favour o f a share capital increase in lieu o f the dissenting shareholders up

<<<

 to the am ount provided for in the plan or (b) order, in favour o f the person(s) who have undertaken to im plem ent the plan, the transfer o f all or part of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholders who own (directly or indirectly)

 a m ajority o f voting rights (including pursuant to any arrangem ent to that effect with any other shareholder that is not contradictory to the d eb to r's interest) o r hold a blo ck in g m inority in the com pany. A ny approval clause is

 deem ed null and void.
Specific case-- creditors that are public institutions: Public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unem ploym ent insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that

<<<

 are sim ilar to those that would be granted by a private economic operator placed in the same position, under normal market conditions. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish

<<<

 these Security Interests. For such purpose, public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, w ithin the fram ework o f a commission before which the heads o f finance departments o f the organizations and institutions concerned are

represented. The tax adm inistrators may grant relief from all direct taxes. W ith regard to indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.
Accelerated safeguardproceedings and acceleratedfinancial

<<<

 safeguardproceedings
A debtor in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings

<<<

 have been designed to "fast-track" the regular safeguard proceedings relating to large companies. The regim e applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is roughly the regime applicable to the regular

<<<

 safeguard proceeding to the extent compatible w ith the accelerated tim ing in accelerated safeguard and/or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, therefore some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims

<<<

 form ed by owners are excluded by law.
The accelerated safeguard proceeding has effect against pre-insolvency creditors that have to file a proof of claim (see below) and as a consequence trade creditors notably will be involved in the accelerated

<<<

 safeguard proceedings, whereas accelerated financial safeguard proceedings only involve financial creditors (i.e. mem bers o f the credit institutions committee and the general assembly o f the holders o f the Notes), w ith no impact on suppliers

<<<

 or public creditors notably (who will thus continue to be paid according to their applicable contract terms and are not subject to the automatic stay applicable during the observation period).
The regime applicable to accelerated financial

<<<

 safeguard proceedings is sim ilar to the one applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings (w hich is now designed as the com m on accelerated proceeding, the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings being a variety o f the latter, designed

<<<

 to "fast- track" purely financial difficulties).
To be eligible to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill the following conditions:
 the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation

<<<

 proceedings when it applies for the opening o f the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings;
 the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days w hen it initially requested the opening o f conciliation

<<<

;
 as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome;
 in the context o f conciliation proceedings, the debtor m ust have prepared a draft safeguard plan that aims

<<<

 to protect its operations in the long run and w hich is likely to be supported, within the group o f those creditors who will be affected by the accelerated (or accelerated financial) safeguard proceedings, by a sufficiently large majority

<<<

 o f them to allow a likely adoption o f the plan by the relevant creditors' committees and the general assem bly o f the folders o f the N otes if any w ithin the duration o f the procedure i.e. three months for accelerated safeguard proceedings

<<<

 or a maximum o f two months for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings;
 the debtor m ust (i) have its accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by an accounting expert and have (x) more than twenty employees; or (y) have

<<<

 a turnover greater than 3 m illion excluding any applicable taxes; or (z) have total assets in its balance sheet greater than 1.5 m illion or (ii) establish consolidated financial statements in accordance w ith article L. 233-16 o f the French

<<<

 Commercial Code; and
 the debtor must exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors' committee (see above) or the court shall have ordered such constitution in the opening decision.
W here accelerated safeguard proceedings are

<<<

 opened, the creditors committees (only the credit institutions committee in accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) and the general assembly o f the holders of the Notes are convened and are required to vote on the proposed accelerated

<<<

 safeguard p lan w ithin the m inim um p eriod o f 15 days o f delivery o f the proposed plan (applicable in safeguard proceedings) (eight days in accelerated financial safeguard proceedings).
The plan is adopted following the same majority

<<<

 rules as in regular safeguard proceedings and it may notably provide for a debt rescheduling, and/or debt cancellation, and/or conversion o f debt into equity (requiring the relevant shareholder consent).
216

The total duration o f the accelerated

<<<

 safeguard proceedings is three months, while the duration o f the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is one month, unless the court decides to extend it by one additional month. If no plan is adopted by the creditors committee(s) and

<<<

 the general assembly o f the holders o f the Notes at the relevant majority rules within such timeframe, the Court shall terminate the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings and cannot impose any uniform debt rescheduling

<<<

.
Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings
Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire) may be initiated against or by a company only if it is insolvent (en etat de cessation des paiem

<<<

 ents) (see "--Insolvency Test") and, for the liquidation proceedings only, if the co m p an y 's recovery is m anifestly im possible. The com pany is required to p etition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation

<<<

 proceedings) w ithin 45 days o f becom ing insolvent. If it does not, de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers may incur civil liability. Such proceedings may also be initiated by any creditor or the

<<<

 public prosecutor.
The date o f insolvency (cessation des paiem ents) is deem ed to be the date o f the court order com m encing ju d icial reorganization o r liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, w h ich m ay b e

<<<

 up to 18 m onths before the date o f the court order commencing such proceedings. Except for fraud, the date o f insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date o f the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation

<<<

) in the context o f conciliation proceedings. The date o f insolvency (cessation des paiem ents) is important because it marks the beginning o f the suspect period (periode suspecte). C ertain transactions undertaken during the suspect p eriod

<<<

 m ay b e v o id or voidable.
Under judicial reorganization proceedings the judicial administrator appointed by the court will assist the debtor in m aking som e o r all the m anagem ent decisions (m ission d 'assistance) and m ay also b e em

<<<

 pow ered b y the court to take over the m anagem ent and control the com pany (m ission d 'adm inistration). The opening o f liquidation proceedings entails the relief o f the debtor o f the management.
The court order commencing the proceedings

<<<

 may order either the judicial reorganization or the judicial liquidation o f the company. In the judicial event o f reorganization, an adm inistrator is usually appointed by the court (administrateur judiciaire) to investigate the business

<<<

 o f the company during an initial observation period, which may last up to 18 m onths, and m akes proposals either fo r the reorganization o f the com pany (by helping the d ebtor to elaborate a reorganization plan-- see above), o r the sale

<<<

 o f the business (p la n de cession). The adm inistrator m ay also request the Court to open judicial liquidation proceedings where the recovery o f the company appears manifestly impossible. Creditors committees and general meeting o f the

<<<

 holders o f the Notes may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings. At any time during this observation period, the court can order the judicial liquidation o f the company under specific conditions (see above). At the

<<<

 end o f the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.
Concerning the judicial liquidation proceedings, there are two possible outcomes o f such liquidation scenario:
 a sale o f the business (plan de cession

<<<

), or
 a sale o f the assets one by one (via auction sales or sales on an amicable basis).
The Court may term inate the proceedings w hen the interest o f the continuation o f the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty

<<<

 to sell the assets. The Court may also appoint a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocate the amounts received from these lawsuits.
Void and voidable transactions
"V oid tran sactio n s" include transactions or paym

<<<

 ents entered into during the suspect period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit o f some creditors to the detrim ent o f other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under w hich the

<<<

 reciprocal obligations o f the company significantly exceed those o f the other party, payments o f debts not due at the time o f payment, paym ents made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course o f business, any escrow

<<<

 ordered by a judicial decision if such decision is not final when reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, security granted for debts previously incurred, any provisional measures (unless the right o f attachment or seizure

<<<

 predates the date o f insolvency (cessation des paiem ents)), share options granted or sold during the suspect period, the transfer o f any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as a security for debt

<<<

 incurred at the same time), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fid u cie) that dedicates assets o r rights as a guaranty o f pre-existing debts and a declaration o f non-seizability (declaration d 'insaisissabilite) applying to certain assets

<<<

 o f the deb to r pursuant to article L .526-1 o f the F rench Commercial Code (e.g., its m ain domicile) during the suspect period.
217

"V oidable tra n sa c tio n s" include paym ents for due debts made from the date o f insolvency (cessation

<<<

 des paiem ents), transactions for consideration and notices o f attachments made to third parties (avis a tiers detenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case if such transactions are made during the suspect period

<<<

 and if the party dealing w ith the debtor company knew that it was insolvent (en etat de cessation des paiem ents) (see "-- In solvency T e s t"). T ransactions relating to the transfer o f assets fo r no consideration are also voidable w h

<<<

 en entered into during the six-m onth period prior to the beginning o f the suspect period.
Creditors' liability
Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 o f the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where safeguard, judicial reorganization

<<<

 or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result o f facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting o f such facilities was wrongful and, in the case o f (i) fraud

<<<

, (ii) clear interference w ith the m anagem ent (immixtion caracterisee dans la gestion) o f the debtor, or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security

<<<

 or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect o f which a creditor is found liable in such circumstances can be cancelled or reduced by the court.
I f a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the co m p an y 's m anagem ent, it can b

<<<

 e deem ed to b e a de facto m anager o f such company (dirigeant de fait). In such a case, Article L. 651-2 o f the French Commercial Code provides that, if judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against

<<<

 the debtor, such creditor may be liable for bearing the excess o f liabilities over the company 's assets, along w ith the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case m ay be, if it is established that th eir m ism anagem ent

<<<

 contributed to the co m p an y 's shortfall o f assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part o f the shortfall amount.
Status of creditors during safeguardproceedings, acceleratedfinancial

<<<

 safeguardproceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings orjudicial liquidation proceedings
As a general rule, creditors dom iciled in France whose claims arose prior to the com m encem ent o f the proceedings must file a proof o f claim w

<<<

 ith the court- appointed creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire) within two months o f the publication o f the court order in the Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales (in an exception, the deadline begins upon the

<<<

 receipt o f an individual notification for those creditors whose claims arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. W here

<<<

 the debtor has inform ed the creditors ' representative o f the existence o f a claim and no proof o f claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed w ith the creditors' representative. Creditors are allowed to ratify a proof o f claim

<<<

 made on their behalf until the judge rules on the adm ission o f their claims. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed w ith the creditors' representative, are barred, except

<<<

 with respect to very lim ited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance w ith the proceedings. Em ployees are not subject to such obligations and are preferential creditors under French law.
In accelerated safeguard and accelerated

<<<

 financial safeguard proceedings, the debts held by creditors affected by the opening o f the relevant proceedings that took part in the conciliation negotiation are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence

<<<

, its accountant) and are thus deem ed to have been filed. Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves o f this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts o f their

<<<

 claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four m onths' time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (even though they would be party to the creditors' committee or the general

<<<

 assembly o f the holder o f the Notes) would have to file their proofs o f claim within the aforem entioned legal time limit.
From the date o f the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings (safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated

<<<

 financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings), the company is prohibited from paying (i) debts (compensation p o u r dettes connexes) outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions, w hich essentially

<<<

 concern the set-off of interrelated debts and paym ents made to recover assets for w hich recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business, provided that such payments are authorized by the supervisory judge and (ii) debts arising

<<<

 after the opening o f the proceedings if such debts are not useful to the proceedings (post-opening, non- privileged debts). During this period, creditors may not initiate or pursue any legal action against the company with respect to any claim

<<<

 arising prior to the court order com m encing the proceedings or, as the case may be, for the aforem entioned post-opening, non-privileged debts if the objective o f such legal action is:
 to obtain an order for or a paym ent o f a sum of

<<<

 money by the company to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that the court fix the amount due); or
 to terminate a contract for the non payment of pre-petition amounts owed by the company; or
218

 to enforce the c red ito r

<<<

's rights against any assets o f the com pany, except w here such asset, w hether tangible or intangible, m ovable or immovable, is located in another M em ber State, in w hich case the rights in rem o f creditors thereon would not be affected

<<<

 by the insolvency procedure, in accordance w ith the terms o f Article 5 o f EU Insolvency Regulation 1346/2000 (provided no secondary proceedings are open in such m em ber state). Sim ilarly, the rights o f a creditor o n the d eb to r's assets

<<<

 located outside F rance (and the EU ) would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they w ere to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located.
Debts validly arising after the com m encem ent o f

<<<

 the proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the b u sin ess's activities during the observation p eriod o r are fo r the requirem ents o f the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this

<<<

 period, must be paid as and w hen they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the com m encem ent o f the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New M oney Lien).
In

<<<

 accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the above rules only apply to the creditors that are subject to the accelerated safeguard proceedings and the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings respectively

<<<

 (see above).
The debtor draws a list o f the claims o f its creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings, w hich is certified by its statutory auditors (or in its absence, its accountant). Although such creditors can file proofs

<<<

 o f claims pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail them selves o f this sim plified alternative and merely adjust the amounts o f their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four m onths' time

<<<

 lim it). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceeding (but who would be impacted by the proceedings) would have to file their proofs o f claim w ithin the aforem entioned legal time limits.
C ontractual provisions th

<<<

 at w ould accelerate the paym ent o f the c o m p an y 's obligations u p o n the occurrence o f the opening of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings are not enforceable

<<<

 under French law. The opening o f liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the m aturity o f all o f a com pany's liabilities unless the continued operation o f the business w ith a v iew to the adoption o f a plan for the

<<<

 sale o f the business (plan de cession) is ordered by the court (three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration o f the liabilities will only occur on the date o f the court decision adopting the plan for the sale o f the business

<<<

 or on the date on w hich the continued operation o f the business ends. Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening o f the proceedings triggers the acceleration o f the debt (for safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings) o

<<<

 r the term ination or cancellation o f an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor, as well as, according to a decision o f the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n12-22.909, "contractual provisions modifying the conditions

<<<

 o f continuation o f an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening o f reorganization proceedings" (which should also apply in case o f safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated

<<<

 financial safeguard proceedings).
The court-appointed adm inistrator may elect to term inate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) w hich he or she believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. O n the contrary, he or she may

<<<

 require the continuation of such contracts provided that the com pany fully perform s its post-petition contractual obligations. During reorganization proceedings, w hen the ongoing contract involves the paym ent o f a sum o f money, this paym

<<<

 ent must be made in cash (i.e. w ithout paym ent term s), unless the adm inistrator obtains extended paym ent deadlines from the contractual partner o f the debtor; the adm inistrator is under an obligation to verify that by continuing the

<<<

 contract he o r she does not risk creating a foreseeable damage for the contractual partner.
The court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems necessary to the continuation o f the business o f the debtor may not be

<<<

 sold w ithout its consent.
If the court adopts a plan for the sale o f the business in judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings w ith a tem porary continuation o f the business, the proceeds from the sale will be allocated for the

<<<

 paym ent o f creditors according to their ranking.
If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation o f the company, the court will appoint a liquidator to sell the assets o f the company and settle the relevant debts in accordance with

<<<

 their ranking. However, in practice, if a plan for the sale o f the business is under consideration, the court will usually appoint a judicial adm inistrator to manage the company and organize such sale o f the business.
French insolvency law

<<<

 assigns priority to the paym ent of certain preferential creditors, including employees, officials appointed by the insolvency court as required by the regulations relating to insolvency proceedings, creditors who, as part o f the approved

<<<

 conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, certain secured creditors in the event o f judicial liquidation proceedings, and the other pre-opening and post-opening creditors, whose
219

order o f priority am ong them

<<<

 selves depends on various factors (in particular, the French State and other public institutions benefit from the highest ranking, w ith respect to taxes and social charges). Some creditors may nevertheless bypass this order o f priority, e

<<<

.g. if they benefit from a retention right over certain assets.
Limitation on enforcement of Security Interests
Security Interests governed by French law may only secure paym ent obligations and may only be enforced following a payment default

<<<

 (including following acceleration) and may only secure obligations up to the secured amount that is due and rem aining unpaid. U nder French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option o f the secured creditors either 

<<<

(i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way o f a sale o f the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds o f the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way o f the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) o f the pledged

<<<

 assets or (ii) by way o f contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or pacte com m issoire) o f the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following w hich the secured creditors becom e the legal owner o f the pledged assets.
If

<<<

 the secured creditors choose to enforce by way o f foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deem ed extinguished up to the value o f the foreclosed assets. In proceedings regarding

<<<

 an attribution judiciaire or a pacte commissoire, an expert is appointed to value the collateral (in this case, the securities). If the value of the collateral exceeds the am ount o f secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay

<<<

 the pledgor an am ount (the soulte) equal to the difference betw een the value o f the securities and the am ount o f the secured debt. This is true regardless o f the actual am ount o f proceeds ultim ately received by the secured creditor

<<<

 from a subsequent sale o f the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral.
If the value o f such securities is less than the am ount o f the secured debt, the relevant am ount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an am ount equal to the value

<<<

 o f such securities, and the rem aining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.
Should the holders o f the security over such collateral decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure o f the securities, an enforcement

<<<

 o f the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance w ith applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale o f a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the

<<<

 sale price received in any such public auction m ight not reflect the value o f our business as a going concern.
Parallel debt
U nder French law, certain "accessory" Security Interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor

<<<

 be the same person. Such Security Interests cannot be held on behalf o f the creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as Trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 o f the French Civil Code or as security

<<<

 agents (agents des suretes) under Article 2328-1 o f the French Civil Code, w hich is not the case here for the security docum ents governed by French law. The holders o f interests in the Notes from tim e to time will not be parties to the

<<<

 security documents. In order to perm it the holders o f the Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreem ent will provide for the creation o f a "Parallel D ebt." Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent

<<<

 becom es the holder o f a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor A greem ent (see "R isk F actors--R isks R ela ted to the Q S F E xchange N otes C ollateral-- The Security In terests in the

<<<

 Q SF E xchange N otes C ollateral w ill n o t be g ra n te d directly to the holders o f the N o tes"). The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, will not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and

<<<

 may not secure the other indebtedness secured by the QSF Exchange N otes Collateral. There is one published decision o f the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel D ebt m echanism s (Cass. com. Septem ber 13, 2011 n10-25533

<<<

 Belvedere) relating to a bond docum entation governed by N ew Y ork law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France o f certain rights (especially the filing o f claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from

<<<

 a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof o f claim o f the legal holders o f a Parallel D ebt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules

<<<

. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double paym ent or artificial liability as a result o f the Parallel D ebt mechanism. A lthough this court decision is generally view ed by legal practitioners and

<<<

 academics as recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure w ill be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue

<<<

 addressed by it is lim ited to the p roof o f claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French Security Interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this m atter is scarce and based on a case

<<<

-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition o f the enforceability in France o f the rights o f a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim and no assurance can be given that such a structure

<<<

 will be effective in all cases before French courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel D ebt construction will eliminate or mitigate the risk o f unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the QSF

<<<

 Exchange Notes Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders o f the
220

Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement o f the security interest in the QSF Exchange Notes

<<<

 Collateral securing the Parallel Debt.
Trustee
Pledges governed by French law may also be granted to the benefit o f the Security Agent as trustee for the holders o f the Notes in accordance w ith the provisions o f the Agency Agreement, and

<<<

 may therefore not directly be granted to holders o f the Notes. A concept o f "trust" has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis o f the FTC and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the Belvedere decision

<<<

 referred to above in respect o f the Parallel D ebt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws o f the State o f N ew Y ork could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France

<<<

. However, while substantial comfort m ay be derived from the above, France has not ratified the L a H aye C onvention o f July 1, 1985 o n the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept o f "trust" has not been generally

<<<

 recognized under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral created under the trust construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders o f the Notes will not receive any proceeds

<<<

 from an enforcem ent o f the security interest in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral securing the trustee rights.
Fraudulent conveyance
French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency

<<<

 proceedings, the "action paulienne" provisions, which offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act perform ed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreem ent pursuant to which such person guarantees

<<<

 the performance o f the obligations o f a third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any o f such p erso n 's o r a third-party's obligations, enters into additional agreem ents ben efitin g fro m existing security and any o

 th er legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings o f the relevant person by, as the case m ay be, the creditors' representative (m andataire judiciaire), the com m issioner o f the safeguard o r

<<<

, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person perform ed such acts w ithout an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case o f the p e rso n 's insolvency proceedings, any creditor, w as prejudiced

<<<

 in its m eans o f recovery as a consequence o f the act; and (iii) at the time the act was perform ed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew o r should have k n o w n that one o r m ore o f such p e rso n 's creditors

<<<

 (existing o r future) w ould be prejudiced in their means o f recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (a titre gratuit), in w hich case such knowledge o f the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on

<<<

 grounds o f fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the granting o f the security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the granting

<<<

 o f such security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result o f such

<<<

 successful challenges, holders o f the Notes may not enjoy the benefit o f the security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral and the value o f any consideration that holders o f the Notes received with respect to the security interests

<<<

 in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral could also be subject to recovery from the holders o f the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders o f the Notes might be held liable for any damages

<<<

 incurred by prejudiced creditors of the French grantor as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Norske Skog is one of the world's leading producers of newsprint and magazine paper

<<<

 with an annual production capacity of three million tonnes. Around three quarters of the group's production capacity is located in Europe, consisting of a relatively balanced portfolio of newsprint and magazine paper. The remaining quarter

<<<

 of the group's production capacity consists of newsprint and magazine paper capacity located in Australasia. Historically, Norske Skog has only produced newsprint in Australasia, but through the conversion of one newsprint machine at the Boyer

<<<

 mill in Australia to magazine paper last year, the group is now also in the magazine paper market in the region. Norske Skog is the sole domestic producer of newsprint and magazine paper in Australasia. Following the conversion, four fifths

<<<

 of the group's capacity in the region is newsprint.
The publication paper industry is mature and demand for paper is in secular decline, with migration of advertising and content from print to digital media. However, paper has certain unique

<<<

 characteristics in achieving attention for advertising and readability for knowledge transferral. Recently, web only strategies from publishers and retailers have been overturned and print editions re-launched. Furthermore, paper is a renewable

<<<

 product, made from recycled paper and growing forests, with a competitive carbon footprint compared to digital devices. No product is more recycled than publication paper at 72%. The role of paper is changing in the digital age, but paper remains

<<<

 a unique and key medium.
The European economy has seen weak growth since the global financial crisis in 2007. Imbalances within the European Union (EU) have made it challenging to adjust to the new normal, as fiscal policies have been country

<<<

 specific, while monetary policy has been Eurozone wide. Governments has thus struggled to reignite growth in the economy with demand strangled by deleveraging and the Euro remaining too strong to boost export activity. Political failure to

<<<

 implement needed structural reforms has exacerbated the problem. The publication paper industry is cyclical through advertisement spending and demand for newspapers and magazines. The business cycle has thus amplified the secular demand decline

<<<

 for publication paper. Reduced demand has led to capacity closures, as the industry has realigned the supply side to a new and smaller market. The outlook for the European economy is for continued weak growth. The business cycle effect should

<<<

 therefore be relatively neutral in 2015, while already announced capacity closures should support the operating environment in the industry.

In Australasia, the demand decline for newsprint levelled out last year following a significant decrease

<<<

 in 2013. Strategic shifts by publishers, in a region with historical high paper usage per capita, led to the 2013 decrease. The now converging level of paper usage should therefore lead to a similar secular decline in Australasia as in other

<<<

 mature markets. Australasian demand for magazine paper decreased slightly in 2014.
NORSKE SKOG IN 2014 Norske Skog generated a weak gross operating result in 2014, reflecting an oversupplied magazine paper market in Europe, which depressed

<<<

 margins and due to a prolonged ramp-up of the new magazine paper machine at Boyer in Australia. The delayed ramp-up led to a significant negative contribution from the newly converted machine in 2014.
Norske Skog completed two large development

<<<

 projects in 2014. At the Saugbrugs mill in Norway, a more energy efficient pulping facility was commissioned, reducing electricity usage. And at Boyer in Tasmania, the conversion of one newsprint machine to coated magazine paper, gave the group

<<<

 exposure to a new market in the region. To optimise the usage of the mill sites, Norske Skog further facilitates access for entrepreneurial initiatives at several locations.
In January 2014, Norske Skog divested its remaining 49% stake in Norske

<<<

 Skog Pisa in Brazil to a consortium of Chilean investors. The consortium had already bought a 51% stake in Pisa in 2013. In 2012, the consortium acquired Norske Skog Bio Bio in Chile.
INCOME STATEMENT AND CASH FLOW Norske Skog's operating revenue

<<<

 in 2014 was NOK 12 billion (NOK 13 billion in 2013). The reduction largely reflected lower capacity in the group following the closure of one machine at Walsum in Germany in December 2013, the divestment of the Singburi mill in Thailand in

<<<

 October 2013 and the deconsolidation of the Pisa mill in Brazil from July 2013. Delivery volumes were down 14%to 2.6 million tonnes.
Gross operating earnings were NOK 801 million in 2014 (NOK 862 million). Depreciation was NOK 735 million in

<<<

 2014 (NOK 728 million).
Restructuring expenses in 2014 amounted to NOK 4 million (NOK 145 million). Other gains and losses in 2014 were NOK 3 million (NOK -1 100 million).

Operating earnings were NOK 65 million in 2014 (NOK -1.1 billion).

<<<

 The improvement reflected the neutral impact from restructuring expenses and other gains and losses.
Financial items in 2014 were NOK -1 357 million (NOK -1 258 million). Net interest expenses were NOK 601 million in 2014 (NOK 614 million)

<<<

. Currency losses, related to translation effects on debt denominated in foreign currencies, were NOK 690 million in 2014 (NOK 618 million). The loss resulted from NOK depreciation through the year.
Income taxes recognised in the income statement

<<<

 for 2014 amounted to NOK -213 million (NOK 500 million). The tax charge reflected reduced deferred tax assets in Norway and France.
Loss for the period was NOK -1.5 billion in 2014 (NOK -1.8 billion). Earnings per share in 2014 were NOK -7

<<<

.9 (NOK -9.7).
Cash flow from operations, after change in working capital, paid interest, restructuring activities and taxes, was NOK 200 million in 2014 (NOK 68 million).
BALANCE SHEET Total assets were NOK 14.0 billion at 31 December 2014

<<<

, compared with NOK 14.6 billion at 31 December 2013. The reduction of NOK 0.6 billion largely reflected reduced working capital as FX effects outweighed depreciation. Total non current assets were NOK 10.7 billion at 31 December 2014, compared

<<<

 to NOK 10.6 billion at 31 December 2013. Cash investments in property, plant and equipment were NOK 274 million in 2014 (NOK 529 million). The lower investment level reflected the completion of the development projects at Saugbrugs and Boyer

<<<

.
Total current assets were NOK 3.3 billion at 31 December 2014, compared with NOK 4.0 billion at 31 December 2013. The decrease was primarily due to reduced working capital.
Total non-current liabilities were NOK 8.9 billion at 31 December

<<<

 2014, compared with NOK 8.8 billion at 31 December 2013.
Net interest-bearing debt increased by NOK 570 million through 2014 and amounted to NOK 7.4 billion at 31 December 2014.The increase reflected a non-cash currency loss on debt denominated

<<<

 in foreign currencies. . During 2014 amounts were drawn on the accounts receivable facilities established in Norway, France and Austria and the NOK bonds NSG 15, 17 and 18 were repaid

ANNUAL REPORT 2014 I NORSKE SKOG

REPORT OF THE BOARD

<<<

 OF DIRECTORS

Equity was NOK 1.3 billion at 31 December 2014, compared with NOK 2.2 billion at 31 December 2013. The decrease reflected loss for the period, in partoffset by a positive currency translation difference recorded in other comprehensive

<<<

 income. Equity per share was NOK 7 at 31 December 2014, compared to NOK 11 at 31 December 2013.
The board confirms that the report of the board of directors and financial statements give a true and fair view of the company's financial position

<<<

, and that the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
DIVIDEND PROPOSAL Based on weak earnings and the company's financial position, the board recommends that no dividend is disbursed for the financial year 2014

<<<

.
SEGMENT ACTIVITY AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT Norske Skog's reporting structure in 2014 provided segment information for publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia. Other activities largely comprise costs above the segment level

<<<

.
Demand for newsprint and magazine paper declined in all markets in 2014. World demand for newsprint and magazine paper decreased by 7% and 3% respectively. The decrease reflected a weak world economy with the structural decline in mature markets

<<<

 amplified by the business cycle. The outlook for the world economy has improved into 2015.
As a response to the weak demand, capacity closures amounting to more than 2 million tonnes of publication paper were announced in Europe and North America

<<<

 during 2014.
PUBLICATION PAPER EUROPE The segment includes the Norske Skog's newsprint and magazine paper operations in Norway, France, Austria and Germany. Annual production capacity is 2.3 million tonnes.
Operating revenue was NOK 9.0 billion

<<<

 in 2014 (NOK 9.4 billion). Gross operating earnings were NOK 582 million (NOK 326 million). The improvement reflected margin expansion with higher prices for newsprint and lower costs following from ongoing cost reduction efforts. Variable

<<<

 costs were relatively stable. Sales volumes were down 11% to 2.0 million tonnes, following the closure of one machine at Walsum in December 2013.
Demand for newsprint and magazine paper in Europe was

6% and 3% lower in 2014 respectively, compared

<<<

 to the year before. Capacity utilisation for the group in Publication Paper Europe was 87% in 2014 (89%).
PUBLICATION PAPER AUSTRALASIA The segment includes the group's newsprint and magazine paper operations in Australia and New Zealand. Annual

<<<

 production capacity is 0.7 million tonnes.
Operating revenue in 2013 was NOK 3.2 billion (NOK 3.9 billion) and gross operating earnings were NOK 287 million (NOK 593 million). The reduction in gross operating earnings resulted from a negative

<<<

 contribution from the new magazine paper machine at Boyer due to a prolonged ramp-up following conversion from newsprint and divestments. Sales volumes declined by 24% to 0.6 million tonnes, reflecting divestments of Pisa in Brazil and Singburi

<<<

 in Thailand.
Demand for newsprint in Oceania decreased by 6% in 2014, while demand for magazine paper declined by 2%. Capacity utilisation for the group in Publication Paper Australasia was 92% in 2014 (88%), when adjusted for the downtime

<<<

 at Boyer during conversion in the first quarter of 2014.
OTHER ACTIVITIES Other activities consist mainly of unallocated group costs and purchase and resale activities to the business units. Negative operating earnings mainly constitute a reduction

<<<

 in the value of energy contracts recognised on the balance sheet.
PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION Newsprint paper prices increased into 2014 due to a healthy supply/demand balance in the segment. Magazine paper remained oversupplied

<<<

 during 2014. Cost of materials were stable throughout the year, while fixed costs initiatives continued. Fixed costs for the group was NOK 2.8 billion in 2014, compared to NOK 3.0 billion the year before.
Several factors were favourable for

<<<

 the group when entering 2015. The converted machine at Boyer was operating in accordance with its business plan and should therefore provide a significant positive contribution to gross operating earnings. Currency levels, with a weak NOK and

<<<

 strong USD, were positive for the group. Norske Skog has a large cost base in NOK and all export business out of Europe is invoiced in USD. The improved relative cost position should therefore be margin enhancing. Lower energy prices was a

<<<

 further

benefit for the group as a large energy consumer. Already announced capacity closure, both in North America and Europe, should support publication prices when completed during 2015, internationally and in Europe respectively.
During

<<<

 2014, the board had full focus on bond maturities in 2015 and beyond, and considered several options. The outcome of this was that on 22 January 2015, Norske Skog launched two separate offers:
(i) an offering of EUR 250 million Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes (SSN) due December 2019 to achieve a broader refinancing and debt extension of the group's capital structure and (ii) an exchange offer of existing notes.
On 24 February 2015, Norske Skog completed the refinancing of a portion of its

<<<

 bond maturities through the issuance of an oversubscribed SSN of EUR 290 million and the exchange of existing bonds into new bonds with longer maturities. Norske Skog extended the maturities on a significant portion of its indebtedness, with

<<<

 new notes maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2023. The new EUR 290 million SSN mature in December 2019 and is structurally senior to all remaining existing notes and notes issued in the exchange offer. The exchange notes is structurally junior to the

<<<

 SSN, but structurally senior to remaining existing notes and mature in 2021 and 2023. The remaining existing notes is structurally junior to the SSN and exchange notes.
Following these transactions, the capital structure of the group has improved

<<<

 significantly through enhanced liquidity, immediate de-leveraging and an extended maturity profile.
The board of directors however recognises the challenging markets that Norske Skog operates in with price and currency uncertainty. The board

<<<

 of directors will thus have a continuous focus on cash generation through 2015 to ensure sufficient liquidity for both debt maturities and the operations of Norske Skog. The ongoing initiatives to improve cash flow from operations and the significantly

<<<

 enhanced liquidity position of the group following the refinancing, should in the opinion of the board of directors provide prudent cash balances during 2015.
Despite this leverage remains high and requires improved profitability, but the refinancing

<<<

 enables the group to focus on improving operations, cost initiatives and capital efficiency.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

ORGANISATION

BOARD OF DIRECTORS Norske Skog's board of directors consists

<<<

 of Jarle Roth (chair), Eilif Due, Siri Beate Hatlen, Karin Bing Orgland, Jon-Aksel Torgersen and three employee-elected representatives Kjetil Bakkan, Paul Kristiansen and Svein Erik Veie. The board is elected by the general meeting.
CORPORATE

<<<

 MANAGEMENT Norske Skog's corporate management consists of Sven Ombudstvedt (president and CEO), Rune Sollie (CFO), Roar delien (COO) and Lars P. Sperre (SVP Corporate Strategy & Legal).
EMPLOYEES Norske Skog had 2 942 employees at the end

<<<

 of 2014. At the end of 2013, there were 3 237 employees. The reduction during 2014 reflected the closure of one machine at Walsum in Germany in December 2013 and group wide ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
HEALTH AND SAFETY Norske Skog aims

<<<

 to have zero injuries among employees. Health and safety is a corporate responsibility, followed up by the individual business units. All near misses and injuries are reported in a global system. Experiences from every single incident are shared

<<<

 with the entire organisation. The H1value, which represents lost-time injuries per million working hours, was 0.97 in 2014. Norske Skog had an absence rate due to sickness of 3.8% in 2014.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Norske Skog's research and

<<<

 development work is performed at the individual business units and in cooperation with external research institutions. The work is coordinated centrally, where the aim is to leverage synergies and best practices throughout the group. There

<<<

 is a continuous focus on developing new paper products to meet market expectations. An example is the research at Saugbrugs on how to apply nano-cellulose to improve paper production.
GENDER EQUALITY, GENDER BALANCE AND DIVERSITY The paper

<<<

 industry has traditionally had few female employees. The proportion of women in Norske Skog has been stable at around 10% for many years.
Norske Skog's board of directors consists of five members elected by the shareholders and three members

<<<

 elected by and among the employees. There are three men and two women among the shareholder-elected members. All of the employee-elected representatives are men. An exception

from the gender balance requirement for employee-elected board members

<<<

 is granted for companies with a total female percentage of less than 20%. Norske Skog complies with the requirement for gender balance on boards of Norwegian public limited companies.
EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES Norske Skog signed a renewal in

<<<

 2013 of the global employee rights agreement with Norwegian Federation of Trade Unions and the International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General worker's unions (ICEM).
COOPERATION PROJECTS Norske Skog and the environmental foundation

<<<

 Bellona have signed a partnership agreement to create a more environmentally-friendly supply chain. The collaboration aims to reduce the environmental impact of current production, utilising logs in a better way and finding the right commercial

<<<

 environmental solutions for production of bio-energy and bio-waste.
RISK MANAGEMENT Norske Skog performs an annual Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) evaluation based on reports from all operating units and corporate functions. The report is

<<<

 presented to the board and is part of the group's risk management activities.
The main risk exposures for the group are linked to price and volume developments for newsprint and magazine paper and the costs of key input factors such as energy

<<<

 and fibre. Currency movements and developments in the broader economic climate remain the largest uncertainties impacting all of the above. High financial leverage in the group amplifies the business risk.
Norske Skog's operations are concentrated

<<<

 on the production of newsprint and magazine paper in Europe and Australasia. Exposure to both newsprint and magazine paper gives product related diversification and two distinct business systems provide geographic diversification.
Norske Skog

<<<

 is not vertically integrated and has to source input factors from third parties. The supply of these input factors is largely covered by long-term contracts which reduce cost fluctuations.
Financial risk management includes currency and liquidity

<<<

 planning. The balance sheet is secured by matching currency denomination of debt and assets. Norske Skog has bonds outstanding issued in EUR and USD, replicating cash flows

from the European assets and the export business outside Europe. The

<<<

 interest rates on these bonds are largely fixed, providing predictability. Liquidity is ensured by a sufficient cash balance and open credit lines linked to accounts receivables (AR) facilities.
Norske Skog performs credit evaluations of counterparties

<<<

. The group's general insurance is managed centrally through a well-established insurance programme.
Risk factors are further discussed in Note 8 in the consolidated financial statements. Corporate governance is described in a separate section

<<<

 of the annual report.
ENVIRONMENT Norske Skog sets environmental targets for each individual production unit, with clear procedures for performance reporting. The group's annual report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative

<<<

 (GRI). In 2003, Norske Skog signed the UN Global Compact treaty, for compliance with the principles of human rights, employee rights, the environment and anti-corruption work. All of Norske Skog's business units are certified in accordance

<<<

 with ISO 14001. For further details of Norske Skog's GRI and UN Global Compact reporting, please see Norske Skog's website, www.norskeskog.com/responsibility
RESOURCES AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Use of recovered paper is an important part

<<<

 of the group's energy and climate work. Recovered paper requires less energy in the production process than wood, and thereby reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
Norske Skog prioritises the procurement of logs and wood chips from certified forestry

<<<

. The company's procurement policy is that all wood must come from sustainable forests. All of Norske Skog business units have traceability certificates to document the origin of wood.
Norske Skog has determined to reduce its greenhouse gas

<<<

 emissions by 25% from 2006 to 2020. The reduction target includes direct greenhouse gas emissions from paper production, and indirect emissions from purchased electricity and heat. The goal will be achieved through a combination of energy conservation

<<<

 and use of alternative energy sources.
OUTLOOK FOR 2015 Publication paper prices in Europe were relatively stable into 2015, beyond certain foreign exchange effects, particular in the UK market. The market balance for newsprint and

40

ANNUAL

<<<

 REPORT 2014 I NORSKE SKOG

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

magazine paper is expected to improve into the second half of 2015, when already announced capacity closures in the industry have been completed. We find it prudent to emphasize

<<<

 the uncertainty related to these forecasts, due to both volatile markets and currency fluctuations.
Paper prices in Australasia are to a large degree stable reflecting long term pricing contracts and a large logistical disadvantage for non

<<<

-domestic producers. Export volumes for newsprint out of Australasia track international prices in Asia and is still expected to be challenging.
The new magazine paper machine at Boyer in Australia should give a significantly positive contribution

<<<

 to gross operating earnings in 2015. Last year the machine was a significant negative contributor due to a prolonged ramp-up.
Variable costs for the group are expected to remain relatively stable. Fixed costs initiatives continue.

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER

<<<

 ASA (THE PARENT COMPANY) The activities of Norske Skogindustrier ASA consist primarily of corporate functions and shared service activities for other Norwegian entities in the group. There has been significant downsizing at the corporate headquarters

<<<

 during recent years. This was reflected in the company's lower employee benefit expenses and other operating expenses.
Financial items amounted to NOK -179 million in 2014. This item included reversal of prior year's impairment losses related

<<<

 to carrying value of shares in subsidiaries of NOK 558 million and dividends from subsidiaries and other companies of NOK 765 million. Reversal of prior year's impairment losses of shares in subsidiaries was a consequence of increased values

<<<

 of the underlying assets. Financial items also included net interest costs of NOK 578 million and negative currency effects of NOK 903 million. Income taxes is related to deferred tax asset, which has been expensed during 2014.

Due to uncertainty

<<<

 related to the timing of utilisation of tax loss carry forward, a significant part of the deferred tax asset was expensed in 2014.
Net cash flow from operating activities in the parent company was negative with NOK 486 million in 2014. This

<<<

 amount was very much impacted by financial payments of NOK 624 million.
At the end of 2014, Norske Skogindustrier ASA had 58 employees, of which 18 were women.
LOSS ALLOCATION The net loss for the year for Norske Skogindustrier ASA (the parent

<<<

 company) in 2014 was NOK -886 million which has been allocated in its entirety to other paid-in equity. Distributable equity in Norske Skogindustrier ASA amounted to NOK 1,061 million at 31 December 2014.

 NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. GENERAL INFORMATION

Norske Skogindustrier ASA ("the company") and its subsidiaries (together "the group") manufacture, distribute and sell publication paper. This

<<<

 includes newsprint and magazine paper. The group has nine fully and partly owned mills in seven countries.

Norske Skogindustrier ASA is incorporated in Norway and has its head office at Skyen outside of Oslo. The company is listed on the

<<<

 Oslo Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors in Norske Skogindustrier ASA on 11 March 2015.

The annual financial statements are presented in English only.

All amounts are presented

<<<

 in NOK million unless otherwise stated. There may be some small differences in the summation of columns and rows due to rounding.

The table below shows the average un-weighted monthly foreign exchange rates applied in the income statement

<<<

 (2014 and 2013) and the closing exchange rates (31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013) applied in the balance sheet for the most important currencies for the Norske Skog group.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial

<<<

 statements of Norske Skogindustrier ASA are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with International Financial

<<<

 Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations from the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as adopted by the European Union (EU). They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of biological

<<<

 assets, available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
CONSOLIDATION a) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group is deemed to have control. The group will have control if

<<<

 it has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, and has exposure to and the power to affect variable returns. Control is generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated

<<<

 from the date at which control is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from the date on which such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between group companies are eliminated

<<<

. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been amended where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the

<<<

 group.

b) Change in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Upon further acquisition of shares

<<<

 in subsidiaries from non controlling interests, the difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary, is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on

<<<

 disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
c) Disposal of subsidiaries When the group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with

<<<

 the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition,

<<<

 any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other

<<<

 comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
d) Associates Associates are all entities over which the group exercises significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% to 50% of

<<<

 the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor's share of the

<<<

 profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition.
The group's share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as Share of profit in associated companies and is assigned to the carrying value of the

<<<

 investment, together with the group's share of other comprehensive income in the associated company. When the group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables

<<<

, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and its associates are recognised in the consolidated

<<<

 financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the associates.
At each reporting date, the group determines whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the

<<<

 case, the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognises the amount as Share of profit in associated companies.
Dilution gains and losses arising

<<<

 in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive

<<<

 income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
SEGMENT REPORTING Reportable segments The activities in the group are divided into two operating segments: publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia. The segment structure

<<<

 is in line with the group's operating model implemented in 2014. The operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who

<<<

 is responsible for allocating resources, making strategic decisions and assessing performance of the group's mills, has been identified as corporate management. The mills have a direct reporting line to corporate management.
Accounting policies

<<<

 applied in the segment reporting Recognition, measurement and classification applied in the segment reporting are consistent with the accounting principles applied for the consolidated income statement and balance

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA

sheet. The option in IFRS 8 allowing different accounting policies to be applied in the segment reporting and group reporting is, for transparency reasons, not applied

<<<

 in Norske Skog.
Performance measurement The group assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of gross operating earnings. These items exclude the effects of expenditure not deemed to be part of the regular operating

<<<

 activities of the segment, such as restructuring expenses, impairments, gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in fair value of certain energy contracts, embedded derivatives in energy contracts and biological assets

<<<

.
Intercompany transactions The revenue reported per operating segment includes both sales to external parties and sales to other segments. Intra-segment sales are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. All sales transactions between

<<<

 operating segments are carried out at arm's length prices as if sold or transferred to independent third parties.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION a) Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the

<<<

 group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic location in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK, which is both the functional and presentational

<<<

 currency of the parent company.
b) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the entity's functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses

<<<

 resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses subject to

<<<

 hedge accounting and relating to currency positions qualifying as net investment hedges and which are hedge accounted, are booked as part of comprehensive income.
Exchange differences arising from the settlement of accounts receivable/payable

<<<

 and unrealised gains/losses on the same positions are recognised in Operating revenue/Cost of materials respectively. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of other items are recognised within Financial items.

acquisition cost for

<<<

 the qualifying asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and

<<<

 the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repair and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land

<<<

 is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The residual value and useful life of property

<<<

, plant and equipment are reviewed and adjusted. Impairment test of property, plant and equipment are performed annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are identified. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to

<<<

 its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount, and included in the income statement line

<<<

 Other gains and losses.
BIOLOGICAL ASSETS Biological assets are measured upon initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs, unless fair value cannot be reliably measured. A gain

<<<

 or loss arising on initial recognition, and from changes in fair value during a period, is reported in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises. When fair value cannot be reliably estimated, the asset is measured at cost less any

<<<

 accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS a) Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired

<<<

 subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill

<<<

 are not reversed.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement as Financial items.
c) Group companies The results and financial position of all group entities

<<<

 which have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i. Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date

<<<

 of that balance sheet, ii. Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates, iii. All resulting exchange differences are booked to comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves.
On consolidation

<<<

, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are booked as part of comprehensive income and presented

<<<

 in other equity reserves. When a foreign operation is fully or partially sold, such exchange differences are booked out of comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement line Other gains and losses as part of the gain or loss on

<<<

 sale.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Land and buildings comprise mainly mills, machinery and office premises. All property, plant and equipment (PPE) is shown at historical cost less subsequent depreciation and impairments. Historical cost includes

<<<

 expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. The residual value of production equipment is defined as the realisable value after deduction of the estimated cost of dismantling and removal of the asset. If the estimated

<<<

 cost exceeds the estimated value, the net liability is added to the cost of the related asset, and a provision is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
Borrowing costs, which are directly related to qualifying assets, are recognised

<<<

 as part of the

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination

<<<

 in which the goodwill arose.
b) Patents and licenses Patents and licenses have a finite useful life and are recognised at historical cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the

<<<

 cost of patents and licences over their estimated useful lives.
c) Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire the specific software and bring it into use, and amortised

<<<

 over their estimated useful lives. Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as they are incurred. Costs which are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products

<<<

 controlled by the group, and which are likely to generate economic benefits exceeding the costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of software development personnel and an appropriate portion

<<<

 of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS Intangible assets, which have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill

<<<

, are not subject to amortisation, but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable

<<<

. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purpose of

<<<

 assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA

separately identifiable (cash-generating units). At each

<<<

 balance sheet date, the possibility of reversing impairment losses in prior periods is evaluated (except for goodwill).
NON-CURRENT ASSETS (OR DISPOSAL GROUPS) HELD FOR SALE Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held

<<<

 for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
FINANCIAL ASSETS The

<<<

 group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available for sale. This classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired

<<<

. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category has two sub-categories

<<<

: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired principally for the purpose of short-term sale or if so designated

<<<

 by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they either are held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of

<<<

 the balance sheet date.

a) Net investment hedge Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion

<<<

 is recognised immediately in the income statement line Financial items. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of or sold.
b) Derivatives at fair value through profit

<<<

 or loss Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any of these derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of quoted investments is based on the current

<<<

 market price. If the market for a financial asset is not active, the group applies valuation techniques to establish the fair value. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments which are substantially

<<<

 the same, and discounted cash flow analyses defined to reflect the issuer's specific circumstances. Fair value includes the impact of credit risk and the adjustment for credit risk is dependent on whether the derivative is in the money (asset

<<<

) or out of the money (liability) (see also Note 9).
SHARES, BONDS, CERTIFICATES, BILLS, ETC. Shares, bonds and certificates classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are valued at market value, with changes in fair

<<<

 value recognised in the income statement.

Non-financial commodity contracts where the relevant commodity is readily convertible to cash, and where the contracts are not for own use, fall within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments - recognition

<<<

 and measurement. Such contracts are treated as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39. Norske Skog has a long-term energy contract in New Zealand that is treated as a derivative and measured at fair value through profit or loss. Furthermore

<<<

, the energy contracts in Norway are nominated in EUR and contain embedded derivatives that are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. See Notes 7, 8 and 9 for more information. Commodity contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are classified

<<<

 as current assets, unless they are expected to be realised more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. In that case, they are classified as non-current assets.
b) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial

<<<

 assets with fixed or determinable payments, which are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables maturing less than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as current assets and presented as Trade and other receivables

<<<

 or Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. Items maturing later than 12 months after the balance sheet date are presented within Other non-current assets.
c) Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are

<<<

 non-derivatives, which are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet

<<<

 date.
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends

<<<

 on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates derivatives as either:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits

<<<

 held at call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Drawn bank overdrafts are shown as Interest-bearing current liabilities in the balance sheet.
INVENTORY Inventories are

<<<

 stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or average purchase price. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct

<<<

 costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
TRADE

<<<

 RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost

<<<

 using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when objective evidence exists that the group will be unable to collect the entire amount due in accordance with

<<<

 the original terms of each receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired

<<<

. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
TRADE PAYABLES Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods

<<<

 or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

a) Hedging of a net

<<<

 investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), b) Derivatives at fair value through profit or loss.
Upon inception of a transaction, the group documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well

<<<

 as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The group also documents its assessment of whether the derivatives that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash

<<<

 flows of hedged items. This assessment is documented both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis through the hedging period.
Accounting for derivatives follows the intentions underlying the associated contract. At the time a contract is

<<<

 entered into, it is defined as either a hedging or a trading contract.

BORROWINGS Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between

<<<

 proceeds (net of transaction costs) and redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowing, using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction

<<<

 costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of

<<<

 the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

programme resulted in a cash payout if the options were exercised. The fair value of the liability was measured at each balance sheet date and on the settlement date. The plan was discontinued

<<<

 from 2013.

BOND LOANS The value of bond loans in the balance sheet is reduced by holdings of Norske Skog bonds. Amounts above or below amortised costs upon buy-back are recognised in the income statement in the same period the buy-back occurs

<<<

.
CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX The group's income tax expense includes current tax based on taxable profit in group companies, change of deferred income taxes for the financial period and adjustments to previous periods. Tax is recognised

<<<

 in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively

<<<

.
The tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax is provided

<<<

 in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their tax bases.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that

<<<

 it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities when the deferred tax assets

<<<

 and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current deferred tax liabilities.
PENSION OBLIGATIONS, BONUS ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER

<<<

 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS a) Pension obligations Group companies operate various pension schemes. These are generally funded through payments to insurance companies, as determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The group has both defined benefit

<<<

 and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is one which defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The

<<<

 liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated

<<<

 annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds

<<<

 which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability, or alternatively a government bond interest rate if such bonds do not exist

<<<

.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognised immediately

<<<

 in income.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. These contributions are made to publicly- or privately-administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual

<<<

 or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made. These contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the period the contribution is related to. Prepaid contributions are

<<<

 recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b) Share-based remuneration Up to and including 2012, the group had a long-term incentive plan where the allocation of synthetic options

<<<

 to members of corporate management was based on the development of the company's share price in relation to a defined group of listed paper producers. The

A revised long-term incentive plan was launched in 2014. The plan targets a positive

<<<

 share price development over a three-year period from 2014 to 2017 and allows the board to grant synthetic share options to the corporate management and other key employees, including managing directors of the Norwegian business units. During

<<<

 the vesting period, the liability recognised at each reporting date is the IFRS 2 fair value of the award at that date multiplied by the expired portion of the vesting period. See also Note 12.
c) Bonus arrangements The group accrues for bonus

<<<

 arrangements when there exists a contractual obligation, or past practice has created a constructive obligation.
PROVISIONS Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised

<<<

 when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions

<<<

 comprise mainly employee termination payments. Restructuring costs are costs which are not related to the ongoing operations. This includes for example severance (redundancy) payments, early retirement or other arrangements for employees leaving

<<<

 the company, external costs relating to coaching, counselling and assistance finding new jobs, or external costs to lawyers and legal advisors in relation to the de-manning process, and lease termination penalties. Provisions are not recognised

<<<

 for future operating losses.
Salary which is earned while the employee contributes to the ongoing operations is not classified as restructuring costs. This includes for example salary in the notice period when the employee is working during

<<<

 the notice period, or bonuses earned whilst the employee contributes to the normal operations. These are booked as normal employee benefit expenses. Costs for projects related to improvements are generally ordinary operating costs.
Where a

<<<

 number of similar obligations exist, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect

<<<

 to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current

<<<

 market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised within Financial items.
REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is measured at the fair value of

<<<

 the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the group's activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group

<<<

. The group's revenue consists almost exclusively of the sale of goods, and the principle for recognition of revenue is the same for newsprint and magazine paper.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the

<<<

 goods have been transferred to the buyer. This will depend upon the buyer's delivery terms and will be in the range from the finalisation of the production to delivery of the goods to the buyer.
The group's terms of delivery are based on Incoterms

<<<

 2010, which are the official rules for the interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Chamber of Commerce. The timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on these delivery terms. The group's sales are covered by the following

<<<

 main categories of terms:
 "D" terms, where the group delivers the goods to the purchaser at the agreed destination, usually the purchaser's premises. The point of sale is when the goods are delivered to the purchaser. If the customer is invoiced

<<<

 before delivery of the goods purchased, revenue is only recognised if the customer has taken over a significant part of the gain and loss potential related to those goods,

ANNUAL REPORT 2014 I NORSKE SKOG

53

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<<<

 NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA

 "C" terms, where the group arranges and pays for the external transport of the goods, but the group no longer bears any responsibility for the goods once they have been handed over to the transporter in accordance

<<<

 with the terms of the contract. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the seller,
 "F" terms, where the purchaser arranges and pays for the transport. The point of sale is when the goods are handed

<<<

 over to the transporter contracted by the purchaser.
DIVIDEND INCOME Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
INTEREST INCOME Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. This is

<<<

 the interest rate that gives a net present value of the cash flow from the loan that is equal to its carrying value.
LEASES Leases in which the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating

<<<

 leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Leases relating to property and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of

<<<

 ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet to the lower of the fair value of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between

<<<

 finance charge and reduction of the outstanding liability, giving a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The leased property is depreciated according to the same principles applied for other non-current

<<<

 assets. The corresponding rental obligation, net of finance charges, is included in other long-term payables. If the leasing period is shorter than the useful life of the asset and it is unlikely that the group will purchase the asset at the

<<<

 end of the leasing period, the asset is depreciated over the leasing period.

impact on the financial statements):
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 10 builds on the existing principles that define the concept of control as the

<<<

 determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control. The standard has been adopted

<<<

 with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 11 removes the option for jointly controlled entities to use proportionate consolidation. Instead, the equity

<<<

 method of accounting must be used. The standard specifies two main categories of joint control: joint ventures and joint operations. For joint ventures, joint control is recognised in accordance with the equity method, but for joint operations

<<<

, the parties shall recognise their rights in the assets and liabilities included in the collaboration. The standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 12 Disclosures

<<<

 of interests in other entities The standard contains disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint ventures, associated companies, special purpose entities and other off balance sheet entities. The standard

<<<

 has been adopted with effect from 1January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IAS 27 Separate financial statements (revised) The rules for consolidated financial statements are replaced by the new IFRS 1

<<<

0 and IFRS 12. What remains of IAS 27 is limited to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in separate financial statements. The standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant

<<<

 impact on the financial statements.

GOVERNMENT GRANTS Government grants (except for emission rights, described below) are recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grants on a systematic basis to the costs that they are intended

<<<

 to compensate for. Government grants in the form of compensation for losses which have already been incurred, or in the form of direct financial support which is not directly related to future costs, are recognised as income in the same period

<<<

 as they are awarded.
Government grants related to assets are presented in the balance sheet as deferred income or as a reduction of the cost price of the assets the grant relates to. The grant is then recognised in the income statement either

<<<

 through future periodic income recognition or as a future reduction in the depreciation charge.
EMISSION RIGHTS There is no accounting standard or interpretation in IFRS regarding the accounting treatment for emission allowances or renewable

<<<

 energy certificates. Received allowances are recognised in the balance sheet as intangible assets at the market value on the date the rights are granted. The difference between fair value and the nominal amount paid for the rights is recognised

<<<

 in the balance as a government grant (deferred income).
Emissions are recognised in the income statement as Cost of materials, and the government grant (deferred revenue) is recognised concurrently with emission costs. Unused credits (deferred

<<<

 income) and used allowances are netted against the carrying amount of intangible asset recognised in the balance sheet, when the individual contracts for emission allowances fall due for settlement.
If the received allowances are sufficient

<<<

 to cover the company's emissions, there will be no net cost or net income in gross operating earnings. If it is necessary to acquire additional allowances on the open market, a provision is made based on actual emissions.
If the number of allowances

<<<

 received exceeds actual consumption, the surplus is sold in the market. The gain/loss from the sale is presented as Other gains and losses.

IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures (revised) As a consequence of the new IFRS 1

 had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IAS 32 - Financial instruments: presentation (amendment) The amendments clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities in the balance sheet. The

 standard has been adopted with effect from 1January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRIC 21 - Levies The group has adopted IFRIC 21 Levies with a date of initial application of 1 January 2014. The group

<<<

 operates in a number of countries where it is subject to government levies. The interpretation clarifies that a levy is not recognised until the obligation event specified in the legislation occurs, even if there is no realistic opportunity

<<<

 to avoid the obligation. The standard has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING STANDARDS A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations

<<<

 are effective for annual periods beginning after 1January 2015. None of these has been early adopted in 2014. New standards and amendments that are expected to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements are listed below:
IFRS 

<<<

9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected

<<<

 credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. IT also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. The standard is

<<<

 mandatory for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 or later. The group has not fully assessed the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining

<<<

 whether, how much and

54

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA

when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction

<<<

 Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes. The standard is mandatory for annual periods beginning 1January 2017 or later. A final analysis of the consequences of IFRS 15 has not yet been completed.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC

<<<

 interpretations, not yet effective, that are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
IMPORTANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires

<<<

 the use of accounting estimates and assumptions for the future. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the group's accounting policies. Estimates and assumptions, which represent a substantial risk for

<<<

 significant changes in the capitalised value of assets and liabilities during the coming financial year, are discussed below.
a) Critical judgment in applying the group's accounting policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements

<<<

 in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosures of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting

<<<

 period. Norske Skog has for instance applied judgment when identifying and recognising embedded derivatives, when choosing to present certain items as "Other gains and losses" as separate line items and presenting profit or loss from associated

<<<

 companies after operating earnings. It is important to note that the use of a different set of assumptions for the presentation of the consolidated financial statements could have resulted in significant changes in the line items presented

<<<

.

using valuation techniques. The group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. See Note 9 for more information.
g) Deferred tax assets

<<<

 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the tax assets will be realised. Significant judgment is required to determine the amount that can be recognised. The recognised amount depends foremost on the expected

<<<

 timing and level of future taxable profits. The judgments relate primarily to tax losses carried forward in Norske Skog's Norwegian operations. When an entity has a history of recent losses, the deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses

<<<

 is recognised only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable profit will be generated. Estimated future taxable profit is not considered as convincing evidence unless the entity demonstrates the ability

<<<

 of generating significant taxable profit in the near future accounting periods or there are certain other events providing sufficient evidence of future taxable profit. The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on a number of assumptions

<<<

 based on management's best judgments. See Note 17 for further information.
h) Pensions The present value of the pension obligation depends on several input factors that are determined by means of a number of actuarial assumptions. The assumptions

<<<

 used in calculating the net pension expense (income) include the discount rate and salary adjustment. Changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying value of the pension obligation. See Note 13 for further information.

b) Estimated

<<<

 decline in value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (PPE) The group performs impairment tests to assess whether there has been a decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE. These are written down to their recoverable

<<<

 amount when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount from assets or cash-generating units is determined by calculating the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in

<<<

 use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates. See Note 4 for further information.

c) Annual assessment of the remaining

<<<

 economic life of PPE The group conducts annual reviews of the remaining economic life of PPE. An increase or decrease in the remaining economic life will have an impact on future depreciation, as well as affect the cash flow horizon for calculating

<<<

 value in use. Economic life is estimated by considering the expected usage, physical wear and tear, as well as technical and commercial development. Assessment of future developments in demand in the markets Norske Skog's products are sold

<<<

 is central to the assessment of the economic life of the group's mills. Expected future demand, together with the competitiveness of Norske Skog's mills, is crucial for the determination of economic life. In addition, legal or other restrictions

<<<

 relating to usage could affect the economic life of the mills in the group.

d) Provision for future environmental obligations The group's provision for future environmental obligations is based on a number of assumptions made using management

<<<

's best judgment. Changes in any of these assumptions could have an impact on the group's provision and group costs. See Note 20 for further information.

e) Residual value and dismantling provision The residual value of the group's production

<<<

 equipment is valued as the anticipated realisable value on the balance sheet date, after deducting the estimated costs relating to asset dismantling, removal and restoration. If the estimated costs exceed the estimated residual values, the

<<<

 net liability is added to the fixed asset cost in the balance sheet and a provision is recognised as a liability. The group performs a review of the residual value of its production equipment at the end of each accounting year. Residual value

<<<

 is affected by short-term changes in the underlying assumptions, for example scrap metal prices. A change in the residual value could have an impact on future depreciation costs. The provision for dismantling costs is based on a number of assumptions

<<<

 made using management's best judgment. See Note 20 for further information.

f) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by

3. OPERATING SEGMENTS

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Norske Skog is a producer of publication paper. Publication paper includes newsprint and magazine paper

<<<

. Newsprint encompasses standard newsprint and other paper qualities used in newspapers, inserts, catalogues, etc. These paper qualities, measured in grammes per square meter, will normally be in the range 40-57 g/m2. Magazine paper encompasses

<<<

 the paper qualities super calendered (SC), machine finished coated (MFC) and light weight coated (LWC). These paper qualities are used in magazines, periodicals, catalogues and brochures.
At the end of 2014, Norske Skog had nine fully or partly

<<<

 owned paper mills in seven countries. Two of the mills produce only magazine paper, one produces both magazine paper and newsprint and six mills produce newsprint only.
The composition of Norske Skog's operating segments was changed with effect

<<<

 from 1January 2014. The activities of the Norske Skog group are now focused on two business systems, namely Europe and Australasia. The segment structure is in line with how the group is managed internally. Norske Skog's chief operating decision

<<<

 maker is corporate management, who distribute resources and assess performance of the group's operating segments. According to the operating model, all mills have a direct reporting line to corporate management. The mills have been aggregated

<<<

 into two operating segments, publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia, based on geographical location. Norske Skog has an integrated strategy in Europe and Australasia to maximize the profit in each region. The optimisation

<<<

 is carried out through coordinated sales and operational planning. The regional planning, in combination with structured sales and operational processes, ensures maximisation of profit.
The comparative figures for 2013 have been restated in

<<<

 accordance with the new segment structure.

PUBLICATION PAPER AUSTRALASIA The publication paper Australasia segment encompasses production and sale of newsprint and magazine paper in Australasia. All the three mills in Australasia and the regional

<<<

 sales organization are included in the operating segment publication paper Australasia.
OTHER ACTIVITIES Activities in the group that do not fall into the operating segments publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia are presented

<<<

 under other activities. This includes corporate functions, real estate activities, energy (commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity contracts) and other holding company activities.
REVENUES AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO OPERATING

<<<

 SEGMENTS Norske Skog manages non-current debt, taxes and cash positions on a group basis. Consequently, financial items and tax expenses are presented only for the group as a whole.
The group's investment in associated companies accounted for

<<<

 in accordance with the equity method is primarily related to its 33.7% share in Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd., which is described in more detail in Note 19 Investments in associated companies.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS Norske Skog had a total

<<<

 sales volume of newsprint and magazine paper of 2 616 000 tonnes in 2014, of which sales to the group's largest customer constituted approximately 300 000 tonnes. Total sales volume in 2014 of newsprint and magazine paper to the five largest

<<<

 customers in Europe and Australasia amounted to approximately 300 000 and 390 000 tonnes respectively.

PUBLICATION PAPER EUROPE The publication paper Europe segment encompasses production and sale of newsprint and magazine paper in Europe

<<<

. All the five European mills and the regional sales organization are included in the operating segment publication paper Europe.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA

ASSUMPTIONS APPLIED WHEN CALCULATING

<<<

 THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT PPE and intangible non-current assets are written down to their recoverable amount when this is lower than the carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its

<<<

 fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from an asset or cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies the value in use approach when calculating recoverable amount

<<<

 for its cash-generating units.

Norske Skog's composition of cash-generating units were reviewed in connection with the revision of its segment structure. The new composition of cash-generating units is aligned with the structure in the internal

<<<

 management reporting system in the Norske Skog group. Publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia represent the two business systems and the products (Newsprint and Magazine paper) that the group is focusing on in its communication

<<<

 with customers, suppliers, employees and the financial market. The basis for the chosen composition of cash-generating units reflects both market and industrial fundamentals for publication paper, and the way Norske Skog follows up the mills

<<<

 operationally and financially. The different mills within the two business systems works together to generate cash inflows. Reflecting customer substitution between different Newsprint and Magazine paper grades it is not operationally meaningful

<<<

 to distinguish at the product level.

The cash-generating unit publication paper Europe consists of Norske Skog Golbey (France), Norske Skog Bruck (Austria), Norske Skog Walsum (Germany), Norske Skog Skogn (Norway) and Norske Skog Saugbrugs

<<<

 (Norway). The cash-generating unit publication paper Australasia consists of Norske Skog Albury (Australia), Norske Skog Boyer (Australia) and Norske Skog Tasman (New Zealand). Each of the two cash-generating units consists of several mills

<<<

 that together are creating a business system. Production can be moved between the mills, based on what gives best profitability for the group as a whole.

Cash flow is calculated individually for each business unit, based on the estimated useful

<<<

 life. The paper industry is a capital-intensive industry where investment decisions are made based on projects with a long time horizon. The production machines have a long technical life, while useful lives are linked to industry cost curves

<<<

 and the size of the market. The estimated remaining useful life of the individual paper machines forms the basis for determining the length of the cash flow period. Estimated useful life for the individual paper machines in the group varies

<<<

 from two to 20 years. For the majority of the paper machines, including those with the highest carrying value, the expected useful life varies from 12 to 20 years. Technical and commercial obsolescence are the main input factors when expected

<<<

 usage of the different paper machines are assessed. Sales volumes develop in accordance with the useful lives of the different paper machines in the group.

Nominal cash flow is estimated in the currency in which it will be generated. The value

<<<

 is calculated by discounting based on a required rate of return on capital that is relevant for the cash generating unit or the individual asset. The required rate of return is based on the interest rate on ten-year government bonds in the

<<<

 currency of the cash flow estimate, an industry debt yield premium, industry beta and an equity risk premium. A country-specific risk premium relevant to the cash-generating unit or individual asset is also included in the required rate of

<<<

 return on capital.

When calculating value in use at the end of 2014, the discount rate after tax was in the interval from 6.2% to 8.9% (6.1% to 8.1% in 2013). The applied discount rate after tax for publication paper Europe was in the interval

<<<

 from 6.2% to 7.5% and publication paper Australasia was in the interval from 8.4% to 8.9%. The discount rate before tax for publication paper Europe was in in the interval from 9.2 %to 10.3% and publication paper Australasia was in the interval

<<<

 from 12% to 12.4%. The main reason for differences in discount rate is due to country specific interest rate levels.

Different conceptual industry scenarios is considered in the impairment testing. By interpolation between the different conceptual

<<<

 scenarios, all possible outcomes are implicitly considered. The different scenarios are weighted by an estimated probability assigned to each outcome. The impairment testing at 31 December 2014 was based on the operating plan for the group

<<<

 for 2015 as approved by the board of directors.

SENSITIVITY TO ESTIMATES OF RECOVERABLE AMOUNT The estimation of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development

<<<

 for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty when it comes to the outcome of these calculations. Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned

<<<

 above to predict how fluctuations would influence recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods

<<<

, sales volumes and the discount rate used. Assuming that the current profit level remains for the key assets, there will be no impairment losses. A reduction in sales price and sales volumes for the whole group in the cash flow period of 5

<<<

% will cause a reduction in recoverable amount in the order of NOK 3 200 million and NOK 1300 million respectively. Correspondingly, a 1%increase in the discount rate will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 700 million. An appreciation

<<<

 of NOK of 1%against all other functional currencies in the Norske Skog group will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 200 million.

EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE Norske Skog has conducted sensitivity analyses with respect to changes in expected useful life of the group's paper machines. If the expected useful life of all the group's paper machines

<<<

 is reduced by one year, the annual depreciation charge will increase by around NOK 70 million.
In connection with the year-end closing process for 2014, Norske Skog performed a review of the expected remaining useful lives of PPE. The expected

<<<

 useful life for the converted Paper Machine 2 at Norske Skog Boyer has been extended with effect from 1January 2015, as the machine last year was converted to Magazine paper from Newsprint. In addition, a minor extension in the useful life

<<<

 of Paper Machine 10 at Norske Skog Walsum has been made. No other changes in useful life will be made in 2015 compared to those applied in 2014. Because the level of depreciation in 2014 by far exceeded purchases of PPE and the mentioned extensions

<<<

 in useful life from 1January 2015, the future annual depreciation amount is expected to decrease.

8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING

<<<



FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS Norske Skog is exposed to various financial risk factors through the group's operating activities, including market risk (interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. Norske

<<<

 Skog seeks to minimise losses and volatility on the group's earnings caused by adverse market movements. Moreover, Norske Skog monitors and manages financial risk based on internal policies and standards set forth by corporate management and

<<<

 approved by the board of directors. These written policies provide principles for the overall risk management as well as standards for managing currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and the use of financial derivatives

<<<

 and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and standards is continuously monitored. There were no breaches of these policies during 2014 or 2013.
MARKET RISK a) Interest rate risk The goal of interest rate risk management

<<<

 is to secure the lowest possible interest rate payments over time within acceptable risk limits. In the current challenging situation in the publication paper market, Norske Skog has secured most of the interest rate payments by primarily paying

<<<

 fixed interest rates on its loan obligations.

All amounts presented in the table are notional amounts. Total interest-bearing liabilities will therefore differ from booked amounts due to bond discounts

<<<

/premiums, hedge reserve, and unrealised effects from fair value hedging (see Note 11 Interest-bearing liabilities). Floating rate exposure is calculated without accounting for potential future refinancing.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

<<<

 In accordance with IFRS 7 Financial instruments - disclosures, an interest rate sensitivity analysis is presented showing the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest costs and interest income, as well as equity where applicable

<<<

. The analysis is based on the following assumptions:

 Floating rate debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates, i.e. the interest costs or interest income associated with such instruments will fluctuatebased on changes in market

<<<

 rates. These changes are accounted for in the sensitivity analysis. The result is based on the assumption that all other factors are kept constant.

 Changes in market rates on fixed rate debt will only affect the income statement if they

<<<

 are measured at fair value. Thus, fixed rate instruments recognised at amortisedcost will not represent an interest rate risk as defined by IFRS 7. Such instruments will therefore not have any influence on the sensitivity analysis.

 Changes

<<<

 in fair value of interest rate derivatives that are not designated as a fair value hedge of the group's liabilities, and which are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, are taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis

<<<

.

 Currency derivatives will only affect the sensitivity analysis to a very limited extent upon changes in the discount rate.

 Results are presented net of tax, using the Norwegian statutory tax rate of 27%.

The interest rate sensitivity

<<<

 analysis is based on a parallel shift in the yield curve for each relevant currency to which Norske Skog is exposed. Following a 50 basis point downward/upward parallel shift in the yield curve in all interest rate markets to which Norske Skog

<<<

 is exposed, net earnings would have been NOK 1 million higher/lower at 31 December 2014 (NOK 2 million lower/ higher at 31 December 2013). Change in net interest payments accounts for NOK 1million, and the total change in market values of derivatives

<<<

 carried at fair value through profit or loss accounts for NOK 0 million.

b) Currency risk Transaction risk - cash flow hedge The group has revenues and expenses in various currencies. The major currencies are NOK, EUR, USD, GBP, AUD and NZD

<<<

. Transaction risk arises because the group has a different currency split on income and expenses. Norske Skog calculates a 12-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling basis. The result of the hedging is included in Financial

<<<

 items in the income statement. Norske Skog does not use hedge accounting for the rolling cash flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a gain of NOK 2 million in 2014 (loss of NOK 66 million in 2013). Over time, currency losses or

<<<

 earnings are expected to offset increased or reduced future gross operating earnings. The cash flow hedge program was closed during 2014.

Translation risk - net investment hedge The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK.

<<<

 Currency translation risk arises when the financial statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies, are translated into NOK. In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition

<<<

 to traditional debt instruments, all combined currency and interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are also used for hedging net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Norske Skog's net investment hedging is carried out in accordance

<<<

 with IAS 39. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity and offset by translation differences from assets in subsidiaries. The gain or loss related to the ineffective portion

<<<

 is immediately recognised in the income statement. There was no ineffectiveness related to net investment hedge in 2014 or 2013. The effective portion recognised in equity was a loss of NOK 151million in 2014 (loss of NOK 243 million in 20

<<<

13). The portion of the debt portfolio to which hedge accounting does not apply, was somewhat smaller in 2014 than in 2013. The Foreign exchange gains and losses from such liabilities are recognised in the income statement under Financial items

<<<

.

Foreign exchange - sensitivity analysis on financial instruments The following foreign exchange sensitivity analysis calculates the sensitivity of derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments on net profit and equity, based

<<<

 on a defined appreciation/ depreciation of NOK against relevant currencies, keeping all other variables constant. The analysis is based on several assumptions, including:

 Norske Skog as a group comprises entities with different functional

<<<

 currencies. Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments of a monetary nature, denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity, create foreign exchange rate exposure on the consolidated income statement

<<<

. Moreover, foreign currency risk will also affect equity.

 Financial instruments denominated in the functional currency of the entity have no currency risk and will therefore not be applicable to this analysis. Furthermore, the foreign currency

<<<

 exposure of translating financial accounts of subsidiaries into the group's presentational currency is not part of this analysis.

 Sensitivity on commodity contracts and embedded derivatives is presented separately under "Commodity risk"

<<<

.

 Currency derivatives and foreign currency debt that are designated as net investment hedges and qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39 will only affect equity.

 Other currency derivatives that are recognised at fair value through

<<<

 profit and loss will affect the income statement. These effects come mainly from currency derivatives and financial liabilities managed as economic net investment hedges which do not qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39.

 Other

<<<

 non-derivative financial instruments accounted for in the analysis comprise cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accounts receivable and borrowings denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity.

 Correlation

<<<

 effects between currencies are not taken into account. Figures are presented net of tax.

At 31 December 2014, if NOK had appreciated 10% against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial

<<<

 instruments would have been NOK 369 million higher (NOK 265 million higher at 31 December 2013). If NOK had depreciated by 10% at 31 December 2014 against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from

<<<

 financial instruments would have been NOK 369 million lower (NOK 285 million lower at 31 December 2013). Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner in 2013 due to changes in the fair value of options. The effect of the sensitivity

<<<

 analysis on the income statement is mainly caused by changes in fair value of derivatives designated as rolling cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange gains/losses on the translation of EUR and USD denominated debt for which there is no hedge

<<<

 accounting. Because the portion of debt has increased in relation to the portion of cash, the effect on the income statement is higher in 2014 compared to 2013.

Given a 10% appreciation/depreciation of NOK, equity would have been NOK 133 million

<<<

 higher/lower (NOK 189 million higher/lower at 31 December 2013) as a result of foreign exchange gains/ losses on financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. The sensitivity analysis on equity excludes the effects from the sensitivity

<<<

 analysis on the income statement, calculated above.

c) Commodity risk A major part of Norske Skog's global commodity demand is secured through long-term contracts. Norske Skog only uses financial instruments to a limited extent to hedge these

<<<

 contracts. The hedging ratio represents a trade-off between risk exposure and the opportunity to take advantage of short-term price drops in the spot market. Hedging levels are regulated through mandates approved by the board of directors.

<<<



Some of Norske Skog's purchase and sales contracts are defined as financial instruments, or contain embedded derivatives, which fall within the scope of IAS 39. These financial instruments and embedded derivatives are measured in the balance

<<<

 sheet at fair value with value changes recognised through profit or loss. Commodity contracts are either financial contracts for the purpose of trading or hedging, or physical commodity contracts that are not for the purpose of own use. The

<<<

 embedded derivatives are common in physical commodity contracts and comprise a wide variety of derivative characteristics.

Changes in fair value of commodity contracts reflect unrealised gains or losses and are calculated as the difference

<<<

 between market price and contract price, discounted to present value. Some commodity contracts are bilateral contracts or embedded derivatives in bilateral contracts, for which there exists no active market. Therefore, valuation techniques

<<<

 are used as much as possible, with the use of available market information. Techniques that reflect how the market could be expected to price instruments are used in non-observable markets.

Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists

<<<

 mainly of physical energy contracts. Fair value of commodity contracts is especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations

<<<

. The energy contracts in Norway are nominated in EUR. These contracts contain embedded derivatives that are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. NOK weakened against EUR during 2014, which had a negative effect on the fair value of the embedded

<<<

 derivatives.

In April 2013, Norske Skog Saugbrugs signed a new long-term energy contract for the supply of electricity for the paper mill in Halden. The new energy contract secures an annual supply of 1.0

LIQUIDITY RISK Norske Skog is exposed to liquidity risk in a scenario when the group's cash flow from operating activities

<<<

 is not sufficient to cover payments of financial liabilities. In order to effectively mitigate liquidity risk, Norske Skog's liquidity risk management strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient cash, as well as securing available financing

<<<

 through committed credit facilities. Managing liquidity risk is centralised on a group level.

In order to uncover future liquidity risk, Norske Skog forecasts both short- and long-term cash flows. Cash flow forecasts include cash flows stemming

<<<

 from operations, investments, financing activities and financial instruments. The group had current investments, cash and cash equivalents of NOK 710 million at 31 December 2014 (NOK 1015 million at 31 December 2013). None credit facility at

<<<

 31 December 2014 (undrawn credit facility of NOK 250 million at 31 December 2013). See Note 11 for more information regarding the maturity of facilities. Restricted bank deposits amounted to NOK 322 million at 31 December 2014 (NOK 258 million

<<<

 at 31 December 2013).

The board of directors recognises the challenging markets that Norske Skog operates in with price and currency uncertainty. The board of directors will thus have a continuous focus on cash generating trough 2015 to ensure

<<<

 sufficient liquidity for both debt maturities and the operations of Norske Skog. The ongoing initiatives to improve cash flow from operations and the significantly enhanced liquidity position of the group following the refinancing, should in

<<<

 the opinion of the board of directors provide prudent cash balances during 2015. Despite this leverage remains high and requires improved profitability, but the refinancing enables the group to focus on improving operations, cost initiatives

<<<

 and capital efficiency.

In February 2015, Norske Skog completed the refinancing of a portion of its bond maturities. See Note 27 for further information.

The following table shows the contractual maturities of non-derivative financial liabilities

<<<

 and other derivative financial instruments. All amounts disclosed in the table are undiscounted cash flows. Furthermore, amounts denominated in foreign currency are translated to NOK using closing rates at 31 December. These amounts consist

<<<

 of trade payables, interest payments and prin cipal payments on derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Variable rate interest cash flows are calculated using the forward yield curve. Projected interest payments are based on the

<<<

 maturity schedule at 31 December without accounting for forecasted refinancing and/or other changes in the liability portfolio. All other cash flows are based on the group's positions held at 31 December 2014.

CREDIT RISK Norske Skog makes a credit evaluation of all financial trading counterparties. Based on the evaluation, a limit on credit exposure is established

<<<

 for each counterparty. These limits are monitored continuously in relation to unrealised profit on financial instruments and placements. The maximum credit risk arising from financial instruments is represented by the carrying amount of financial

<<<

 assets in the balance sheet. This includes derivatives with positive market value except for embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives are not subjected to credit risk, as there are no future cash flows associated with such derivatives.
Norske

<<<

 Skog trades with a group of large Nordic and international banks which are publicly rated in the interval from AA- to A-. The credit risk on deposits and derivative transactions is spread across these banks.
Norske Skog's procedures for credit

<<<

 management of European trade receivables, and the authority to approve credit lines to customers of European business units, are regulated by a policy drafted and maintained by a centralised credit management function at the head office. The

<<<

 operational responsibility to act within the guidelines as set out by this policy lies with each business unit. For operations outside of Europe, customer credit management is handled locally.

 described as levels and are defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1that are observable for the asset or

Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consist mainly of physical energy contracts. The commodity

<<<

 contracts classified as financial contracts are mainly related to energy contracts in Australia and New Zealand. Embedded derivatives are mainly related to energy contracts in Norway. Fair value of commodity contracts is sensitive to estimates

<<<

 of future energy prices. Fair value of embedded derivatives is sensitive to estimates of currency exchange rates and price indices.
The fair value of derivatives that are not traded in an active market (over-the-counter derivatives) is determined

<<<

 using various valuation techniques. Interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forward rate agreements and foreign currency forward contracts are all valued by estimating the present value of future cash flows. Currency options are valued using

<<<

 recognised option pricing models. Quoted cash and swap rates are used as input for calculating zero coupon curves used for discounting. The exchange rates used are the quoted closing rates at 31 December.
The fair value of commodity contracts

<<<

 recognised in the balance sheet is calculated by using quotes from actively traded markets when available. Otherwise, price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used. Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria

<<<

 in IAS 39 are recognised in the balance sheet and valued on the same principle as financial con tracts. Some of these are long-term energy contracts. In calculating the fair value of embedded derivatives, valuation techniques are used in the

<<<

 absence of observable market inputs. Embedded currency options are calculated using a Black 76 valuation model, where some input assumptions have been made in absence of an active long-term option market. Fair value includes the impact of credit

<<<

 risk and the adjustment for credit risk is dependent on whether the derivative is in the money (asset) or out of the money (liability). Credit value adjustment

is applied to assets positions based on credit risk associated with the counter-party. Debit value adjustment is (from 2014) applied to liability positions, based on Norske Skog's own credit risk. The following table is

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAMME A revised long-term incentive plan was launched in 2014. The plan targets a

<<<

 positive share price development over a three-year period from 2014 to 2017 and allows the board to grant synthetic share options to the corporate management and other key employees, including managing directors of the Norwegian business units

<<<

. The synthetic options are to be settled in 2017, at the board's discretion, a maximum of one third of the total number of options can be awarded through a bonus payment each year. The long-term incentive program issued in total 3 780 000 synthetic

<<<

 options. At the start of the program, (award date 17 July 2014) 2 250 000 synthetic options were awarded, leaving 1530 000 synthetic options to be granted later. Each option carries the right to be paid an amount in cash equal to (a) the fair

<<<

 market value less (b) the exercise price, including any hurdle rate added to the exercise price as of the exercise date. Fair market value is the volume weighted average trading price of the shares on Oslo Stock Exchange over a period of five

<<<

 trading days starting on the exercise date. The exercise date is the latter of the date falling three years after the award date or the date of publication of the company's interim financial statements for the first six months of 2017. The

<<<

 initial exercise price (strike price) for the synthetic options was NOK 4.80. The exercise price shall be increased by 10 per cent pro anno (the hurdle rate). The hurdle rate shall be added to the exercise price annually in arrears as of each

<<<

 anniversary of the award date, and shall from then be included in the basis for the calculation of further hurdle rate.
The ultimate cost of a cash-settled share-based transaction is the actual cash paid to the counterparty, which will be the

<<<

 fair value at settlement date. The periodic determination of this liability is at each reporting date between grant and settlement the fair value of the award. The fair value of the award is determined in accordance with the specific requirements

<<<

 in IFRS 2. During the vesting period, the liability recognised at each reporting date is the fair value of the award at that date multiplied by the expired portion of the vesting period. All changes in the liability are recognised in profit

<<<

 or loss for the period. The fair value of the liability is determined by applying an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the cash-settled transaction was granted, and the extent to which the employees

<<<

&&& have rendered services to date. Norske Skog has made a fair value measurement of the liability using a Black & Scholes model for European call options with no dividends.

The defined benefit schemes

<<<

 in Norway cover people between 56 and 67 years of age, who were employed before 1 January 2011. The defined benefit obligations in Norway only encompass active members (a small number of people in early retirement until the end of 2015), since

<<<

 they leave the defined benefit scheme (having a paid-up policy) when they retire.

Plan assets of the pension schemes in Norske Skogindustrier ASA, Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS and Norske Skog Skogn AS are managed by a life insurance company and

<<<

 invested in accordance with the general guidelines governing investments by life insurance companies in Norway. With effect from the beginning of 2011, a new defined contribution scheme was introduced in Norway, with a contribution of 4% for

<<<

 earnings between 1 and 6 G and 8% between 6 and 12 G. The defined benefit plan was closed and now only covers employees born before 1 January 1959 who were employed before the closure.

When evaluating plan assets, their estimated value at

<<<

 31 December is used. This estimated value is corrected every year in accordance with the figures for the market value of the assets provided by the insurance company.

Expected return on plan assets is based on historical return and the investment

<<<

 profile of the plan assets.

When measuring incurred obligations, the estimated obligation at 31 December is used. This estimated obligation is corrected every year in accordance with the figures for incurred pension obligations provided by

<<<

 the actuary.

In addition to the benefit obligation funded through insurance plans, the group has unfunded benefit obligations, of which Norske Skog Walsum GmbH is the largest. The defined benefit scheme at Norske Skog Walsum GmbH was curtailed

<<<

 at the level it had at 31 December 2010, meaning there is no increase in the obligation as a result of salary increases or the time worked for the company after this date. The majority of employees covered by the defined benefit scheme at Norske

<<<

 Skog Walsum are in their late fifties and sixties. Number of retired people is 183. The un funded obligations also include estimated future obligations relating to the former Norwegian early retirement scheme, pensions to former owners of subsidiaries

<<<

 as well as pensions for senior management and directors. Obligations relating to senior management pensions are partly funded through a supplementary retirement plan with a life insurance company.

In addition to defined benefit plans, there

<<<

 are also various defined contribution plans.

The discount rate applied for the pension schemes in Norway for 2014 is based on the interest rate for covered bonds. Subsidiaries can deviate from these assumptions if local conditions require

<<<

 this. The discount rates applied vary from1.9% to 3.7%. For Norske Skog Walsum GmbH, the discount rate used is 1.9% (2013: 3.5%). Norske Skog has used the mortality table in Norway (K2013BE).

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses for the most important assumptions related to defined benefit schemes to predict how fluctuations will impact pension liabilities in the consolidated balance

<<<

 sheet. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of pension obligations the amount is most sensitive to changes in discount rate, salary adjustment and pension growth rate. The sensitivity of the pension obligation is shown in

<<<

 the table below:

Discount rate - 0.5% Salary adjustment - 0.5% Future national security - 1.0% Future pension - 1.0%

INCREASE -69
N/A

DECREASE
67 11 11 N/A

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption

<<<

 while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

The net loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment in 2013 of NOK 178 million was primarily related to the divestments of Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil and Norske Skog (Thailand) Co. Ltd. in Thailand.

<<<


On 14 June 2013, Norske Skog signed an agreement for the sale of 51% of its shares in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil. The transaction was completed on 27 June 2013. The total loss of NOK 218 million on the divestment consisted of NOK 95 million

<<<

 relating to the divestment of 51% of the shares, and NOK 123 million relating to the remaining 49% stake which was recognised in the balance sheet as an associated company in line with the equity method of accounting at 31 December 2013. The

<<<

 loss on the remaining 49% stake consisted of the difference between the book value of the net assets derecognised and the fair value of the investment in associated company. See Note 19 Investments in associated companies for more information

<<<

. The loss on the divested 51% stake included NOK 12 million relating to currency translation differences and net investment hedge that were recognised directly in equity during the ownership period and reclassified to Other gains and losses

<<<

 upon loss of control.
On 5 October 2013, Norske Skog signed an agreement for the sale of its shares in the company that owns and operates the mill at Singburi in Thailand, Norske Skog (Thailand) Co. Ltd. The transaction was completed on 21

<<<

 November 2013. Norske Skog Singburi was deconsolidated from this date and a gain of NOK 49 million was recognised. This amount included a gain of NOK 35 million related to currency translation differences that were recognised directly in equity

<<<

 during the ownership period and reclassified to Other gains and losses upon divestment.
The net loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment also included a loss of NOK 26 million in relation to input VAT on transaction

<<<

 costs incurred upon the divestments of mills in South Korea and China in previous years. The Norwegian VAT authorities claim that this amount is not deductible. However, Norske Skog does not agree with this claim and expects to take out legal

<<<

 proceedings. Norske Skog has no outstanding payments to the VAT authorities in relation to this amount and has expensed the full amount in 2013, due to uncertainty regarding the outcome of this case. The remaining amount included in the net

<<<

 loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment included a gain of NOK 23 million on divestments of non production related property.
Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists mainly of physical energy

<<<

 contracts. The fair value of commodity contracts is especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts is influenced by currency and price index fluctuations. A sensitivity

<<<

 analysis of the impact on profit after tax of fluctuations in energy prices, currency and price indices is given in Note 8. The valuation techniques used are described in Note 9. The gain on commodity contracts in 2014 were due to negative

<<<

 change in Producer price index in New Zealand. In 2013 the losses were due to lower expected future energy prices.
Other realised gains and losses of NOK 13 million in 2014 were primarily related financial hedging of energy and sale of emission

<<<

 rights. Other realised gains and losses of NOK -102 million in 2013 were primarily related to the termination of the long-term group agreement from 1998 that applied to the supply of energy in Southern Norway.

 for severance payments and other costs of NOK 13 million as a result of the ongoing downsizing at head office and changes in corporate management, NOK 7 million at Norske Skog Bruck, and NOK 5 million at Norske Skog Boyer.
The amount expensed

<<<

 in 2013 in relation to restructuring activities amounted to NOK 145 million. This amount related mainly to the provisions listed above, offset by the recognition of NOK 10 million income due to the release of provisions expensed in 2012 at

<<<

 Norske Skog Tasman (NOK 6 million), Norske Skog Golbey (NOK 3 million) and Norske Skog Skogn (NOK 1 million). Total cash flow relating to restructuring activities in 2013 amounted to NOK 122 million, and related mainly to Norske Skog Tasman

<<<

 (NOK 77 million), Norske Skog Walsum (NOK 20 million) and head office (NOK 13 million).
DISMANTLING PROVISION Provisions related to future dismantling costs arising from a future closing down of production facilities amounted to NOK 65 million

<<<

 at 31 December 2014, compared to NOK 56 million at 31 December 2013. The total amount is classified as non-current and will only be realised at the time of a future shut down of any of the Norske Skog production units. The provision is the

<<<

 net present value of the future estimated costs, calculated using a long-term risk-free interest rate. The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement line Financial items. The opposite entry for dismantling provision

<<<

 and change in provision estimates is Property, plant and equipment.
Discount rates and assumptions included as part of the best estimate will impact the future carrying value of the dismantling provision. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction

<<<

 in the future discount rate of one percentage point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 9 million, with a corresponding increase in future depreciation on property, plant and equipment.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISION The group's provision

<<<

 for environmental obligations is presented in the balance sheet as Other non-current liabilities. The provision is related to estimated future costs for cleaning up any environmental pollution caused by Norske Skog production units. The provision

<<<

 will mainly be realised in a future period upon a potential shut down of the production activities of any of the Norske Skog production units. Increased environmental requirements from local governments may also lead to realisation of this

<<<

 provision at an earlier point in time.
Provisions for future environmental obligations amounted to NOK 211 million at 31 December 2014 compared to NOK193 million at 31 December 2013. The increase is due to currency translation effects and lower

<<<

 discount rates. Resources spent on environmental activities during 2014 amounted to NOK 4 million.
The carrying value of the provision is the best estimate made by measuring the expected value of the specific obligations, discounted to present

<<<

 value using a long-term risk-free interest rate when the time value of money is material. Changes in factors included in the expected value will impact the carrying value of the obligation. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction in the

<<<

 future discount rate by one percentage point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 24 million. Changes in accounting estimates not related to assets are classified as operating items in the income statement, and the periodic unwinding

<<<

 of the discount is recognised within the income statement line Financial items.

24. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Norske Skog's objective when managing capital

<<<

 is to maximise return on equity within the limits set by the group's external debt financing. In order to improve the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue

<<<

 new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. See Note 8 for futher information on the debt maturity and Note 27 for futher information on the refinancing of bonds after the balance sheet date.

25. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Norske Skog is an international

<<<

 company that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and contracting parties as well as assessments from public authorities in each country it operates.
Norske Skog has continued

<<<

 the process related to simplification of the group's corporate structure in 2014. The simplification of the group's corporate structure in combination with changes in individual countries' tax laws could increase the group's tax exposure. However

<<<

, due to completed reorganisations and tax assessments, the overall tax exposure has decreased during the last years.

26. RELATED PARTIES
All transactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with the arm's length principle.
Some

<<<

 of Norske Skogindustrier ASA's shareholders are forest owners delivering forestry products to the group's production units in Norway. One of the board members, Eilif Due, is a forest owner who supplies wood to the group on normal commercial

<<<

 terms. All contracts for supply of wood are entered into through forest owner associations or companies.
In 2013, Norske Skog entered into a contract with Fram Eiendom (Fram Realinvest AS, Sjlyststranda Nring AS, Fram Eiendomsdrift AS and

<<<

 Skyen Nringsbygg AS) for the lease of its head office at Skyen. Torstein I. Tvenge, together with close family members, controls 100% of Fram Eiendom. Tvenge is also a shareholder of Norske Skogindustrier ASA. The lease contract for the

<<<

 head office has been entered into on normal commercial terms. Lease payments to Fram Eiendom recognised as an expense in 2014 amounted to NOK 4.1 million.
Purchases of goods and services by associated company Malaysian Newsprint Industries

<<<

 Sdn. Bhd. (MNI) from other companies in the Norske Skog group during 2014 amounted to NOK 0 million (NOK 10 million in 2013). There were no amounts payable by MNI to the Norske Skog group at 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013.
None of the

<<<

 board members receives remuneration for their work for the company from any source other than the company itself.

27. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE

<<<

 SHEET DATE
On 22 January 2015, Norske Skog launched two separate offers (i) an offering of EUR 290 million (EUR 179 million) Senior Secured Notes (SSN) due December 2019 to achieve a broader refinancing and debt extension of the group's capital

<<<

 structure and (ii) an exchange offer of existing notes.
On 24 February 2015, Norske Skog completed the refinancing of a portion of its bond maturities through the issuance of EUR 290 million senior secured notes (SSN) and the exchange of existing

<<<

 bonds into new bonds with longer maturities. Norske Skog has extended the maturities on a significant portion of its indebtedness, with new notes maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2023. The new EUR 290 million SSN mature in December 2019 and will

<<<

 be structurally senior to all remaining existing notes and notes issued in the exchange offer. The SSN is secured by among other things share pledge in operating subsidiaries, new intermediate holding companies, and in addition asset pledge

<<<

 in the Australasian business. The terms of the SSN include customary default and cross default terms, and the pool of security can be enforced upon in a continuing default scenario under the SSNs. The exchange notes will be structurally junior

<<<

 to the SSN, but structurally senior to remaining existing notes and mature in 2021 and 2023. The remaining existing notes will be structurally junior to the SSN and exchange notes.
More than 75% of the existing bond holders consented to the

<<<

 transactions, and approximately 45% of the existing bonds participated in the exchange offer. Immediate de-leveraging of around NOK 500 million was realized in the refinancing. This leads to a significant improvement in the group's total liquidity

<<<

, despite a short-term increase in the cost of borrowings.
In January, prior to the offering of the SSN and the exchange offer, several changes in the Norske Skog corporate structure were made. Norske Skog AS was established as the issuer of

<<<

 the SSN, while Norske Skog Holding AS was established as the offeror of the exchange notes.
The chair of the board at Norske Skogindustrier ASA Jarle Roth has informed the election committee that he is not a candidate for re-election as chair

<<<

. The election committee unanimously proposes that Jon-Aksel Torgersen take over as new chair at the annual general meeting on 16 April 2015. Jon-Aksel Torgersen has been director of the board since 2012, and has extensive management and board

<<<

 experience from Norwegian and international industry, shipping and finance.
There have been no other events after the balance sheet date with significant impact on the financial statements for 2014.

10. SALARY AND OTHER REMUNERATION FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES

According to the provision in section 6-16a of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act (cf. section 5-6, third subsection), the annual general meeting (AGM) shall consider the

<<<

 board's declaration regarding the determination of pay and other remuneration for senior executives in the coming financial year. The board will propose the declaration at the AGM for consideration and a vote.
The board of Norske Skogindustrier

<<<

 ASA has had a remuneration committee since 2000, which considers issues relating to the compensation of the president and chief executive officer (CEO) and other members of corporate management. When the methods for assessing salary and possible

<<<

 bonuses, options and other incentive schemes are to be determined, the committee will ensure that the size and scope of compensation and pay reflect the responsibilities and duties of the recipient, and that these arrangements contribute to

<<<

 long term value creation for all the shareholders.
FIXED SALARY The board has not established any upper and/or lower limits to the amounts that can be paid to senior executives in the company as fixed salary in the coming financial year. See

<<<

 also Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements.
VARIABLE ELEMENTS In addition to fixed salary, the company has a bonus and incentive programme designed to help harmonise the priorities of corporate management with the strategies and

<<<

 goals for the business established by the board:
Annual incentive plans The company has operated bonus schemes for executives and employees for a number of years, to ensure that important commercial goals receive adequate priority. These annual

<<<

 incentive plans for corporate management provide a maximum payout corresponding to 50 % of annual base salary. The performance figures are based on financial, operational and individual criteria.

later. Each option carries the right to be

<<<

 paid an amount in cash equal to (a) the fair market value less (b) the exercise price, including any hurdle rate added to the exercise price as of the exercise date. Fair market value is the volume weighted average trading price of the shares

<<<

 on Oslo Stock Exchange over a period of five trading days starting on the exercise date. The exercise date is the latter of the date falling three years after the award date or the date of publication of the company's interim financial statements

<<<

 for the first six months of 2014. The initial exercise price (strike price) for the synthetic options was NOK 4.80. The exercise price shall be increased by 10 per cent pro anno (the hurdle rate). The hurdle rate shall be added to the exercise

<<<

 price annually in arrears as of each anniversary of the award date, and shall from then be included in the basis for the calculation of further hurdle rate.
The long-term incentive plan launched in 2014 fells within the scope of IFRS 2 Share

<<<

-based payments. A share-based payment transaction is a transaction in which the company receives services from the employee of those services in a share-based payment arrangement. A cashsettled share-based payment transaction is a share-based

<<<

 payment transaction in which the entity acquires services by incurring a liability to transfer cash to the employee of those services for amounts that are based on the price of the shares in the company. IFRS 2 applies not only to awards of

<<<

 shares but also to awards of cash of a value equivalent to the value, or a movement in the value, of a particular number of shares, which is the case for the long term incentive plan. The ultimate cost of a cash-settled share-based transaction

<<<

 is the actual cash paid to the counterparty, which will be the fair value at settlement date. The periodic determination of this liability is at each reporting date between grant and settlement the fair value of the award. The fair value of

<<<

 the award is determined in accordance with the specific requirements in IFRS 2. During the vesting period, the liability recognised at each reporting date is the fair value of the award at that date multiplied by the expired portion of the

<<<

 vesting period. All changes in the liability are recognised in profit or loss for the period. The fair value of the liability is determined by applying an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the cash

<<<

&&&-settled transaction was granted, and the extent to which the employees have rendered services to date. Norske Skog has made a fair value measurement of the liability using a Black & Scholes model for European call options with no dividends

<<<

.

Long-term incentive programme The purpose of the company's long-term incentive programme is to secure a continued strong focus on the development of shareholder value. The board adopted new principles for the long-term incentive programme

<<<

 in 2007, where the criteria for awarding synthetic shares to corporate management is tied to Total Shareholder Return (TSR - development of the share price including dividend payments), such that this must be above average for a defined group

<<<

 of 10 listed paper manufacturers, including Norske Skog. A positive TSR for the period is also an absolute condition. This scheme will yield a 30% payout if Norske Skog performs better than the average for the reference group and a full payout

<<<

 if the company falls within the best quartile. Progress is measured over a three-year period, with a new period beginning each year. There is no dilution effect as a result of the scheme.
The programme was continued for 2008 and 2009. It was

<<<

 continued for 2010 with some changes: the maximum annual bonus from the programme was set to NOK 4 million for the CEO and NOK 2 million for other members of corporate management (instead of a fixed number of shares), and the bonus after tax

<<<

 must be used to purchase shares until the total shareholding in the company corresponds to a certain number of shares (200 000 for the CEO and 100 000 for other members of corporate management). The programme was continued for 2011 and 201

<<<

2, but there was no offer for 2013 or 2014. The programme was applicable for the CEO and one previous member of corporate management and will be concluded in 2015.
A revised long-term incentive plan was launched in 2014. The plan targets a positive

<<<

 share price development over a three-years period from 2014 to 2017 and allows the board to grant synthetic share options to the corporate management and other key employees, including managing directors of the Norwegian business units. The

<<<

 synthetic options are to be settled in 2017, at the board's discretion, a maximum of one third of the total number of options can be awarded through a bonus payment each year. The long-term incentive program issued in total 3 780 000 synthetic

<<<

 options. At the start of the program, (award date 17 July 2014) 2 250 000 synthetic options were awarded, leaving 1 530 000 synthetic options to be granted

Further variable elements Further variable elements include a fixed mileage allowance

<<<

, newspapers, mobile phone and coverage of the costs of broadband communication in accordance with established standards.
PENSION PLANS Norske Skogindustrier ASA introduced the current defined contribution plan with effect from 1 January 20

<<<

11, with a contribution of 4% for earnings between 1 and 6 G (base amount in the Norwegian national insurance scheme) and 8% between 6 and 12 G. The previous scheme with pensionable age of 67 and providing a pension of approximately 65% of ordinary

<<<

 salary at retirement, and 60% from the age of 77 including national insurance, was closed from 31 December 2010, and now only covers employees who were born prior to 1 January 1959 and who were employed in the company before the closure. The

<<<

 company also has a supplementary scheme for the part of salary exceeding 12 G, and there is a separate early retirement pension scheme from 64 to 67 years for corporate management, previously referred to as insured supplementary plans. It was

<<<

 decided to terminate these insured supplementary plans with effect from 1 January 2007 and they were replaced by a book reserve arrangement for the pension part, a disability insurance and a group life insurance (annual base salary) replacing

<<<

 dependents' pensions. Corporate management is covered by a special group life insurance policy with payments limited to three times the annual salary and a maximum of 80 G. Old age pension for the part of salary exceeding 12 G was also changed

<<<

 to a defined contribution plan from 1 January 2011. At the time of the change, employees who were born before 1 January 1959 were given the opportunity to continue with the defined benefit plan. Norske Skog provided salary compensation for

<<<

 employees who were at a financial disadvantage because of the change from a defined benefit to a defined contribution plan, both in the main plan and in the plan for salary above 12 G. This salary compensation was based on certain assumptions

<<<

 about the future at the time of the change, including return on assets, salary adjustment, change in the base amount (G) and inflation. The compensation will not be changed even if these factors should turn out to be different from the assumptions

<<<

.
The defined benefit plan for the part of salary exceeding 12 G was closed from 1 January 2011,

108

and no new members will enter the scheme. The same applies

<<<

 for the early retirement scheme for corporate management.
TERMINATION PAYMENT AGREEMENTS The mutual period of notice for the CEO is six months. If circumstances arise in which the

company and the CEO, by mutual agreement, terminate the contract

<<<

 of employment in the best interests of the company, the CEO is entitled to severance pay equivalent to payment of base salary for 18 months after the end of the notice period. The amount receivable by other members of corporate management under

<<<

 the same circumstances is severance pay equivalent to payment of base salary for nine months.

GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND PUBLICATION PAPER

Biogas in Europe The Saugbrugs mill in Norway

<<<

 has commenced construction of the new biogas facility. The facility is on schedule for completion by yearend 2016. Onsite biogas facilities bring twofold economic benefits; a new biogas revenue stream and reduced paper production costs. Biogas

<<<

 is further a renewable alternative to fossil fuels, which forms part of the carbon solution. Moreover, biogas has large potentials in improving urban air quality. Norske Skog is currently considering biogas projects at several other mills.

<<<


Wood pellets in New Zealand Norske Skog is currently ramping up production at the acquired pellets producer Nature's Flame to 80 000 tonnes annually. Norske Skog will consider further expanding the

pellets production to the Tasman newsprint

<<<

 site, leveraging waste fibre for renewable pellets revenue. The export potential to Asia is large given the site's favourable New Zealand location. Pellets bring significant environmental benefits in replacing fossil fuels for heating with

<<<

 renewable wood pellets.
ENTERING THE TISSUE MARKET
Norske Skog has formalized the joint venture structure for conversion of the newsprint machine at Bruck in Austria to tissue production with partner Roto-cart. The project is progressing in

 accordance with plan.

The segm ent constitutes Norske Skog's European operations in the publication paper market, with mills in Norway, France and Austria. Annual production capacity is 2.1 million tonnes.

<<<


Operating revenue increased slightly despite somewhat lower sales volume. The volume w as down due to the deconsolidation of Walsum. A significant depreciation of NOK counterbalanced this volume effect. Underlying publication paper prices were

<<<

 relatively flat.
Both variable cost and fixed costs decreased following deconsolidation of the uncompetitive Walsum operations.
G ross operating earnings improved significantly quarter-over-quarter with both higher revenue and lower costs,

<<<

 while there was a reduction

year-over-year due to depressed European price levels for newsprint and magazine paper.
Demand for newsprint and magazine paper in Europe decreased by 7% and 4% respectively through August of 2015, compared to the

<<<

 sam e period last year.
Capacity utilisation improved to 82% in Q3 2015 from a historically low level in the previous quarter. One machine at Skogn remained out of operation throughout the quarter for commercial reasons.

The segm ent consists of Norske Skog's operations in Australasia, with mills in Australia and New Zealand. Annual production capacity is 0.7 million tonnes.
Operating revenue declined with more export sales at low prices, AUD

<<<

 depreciation and discontinuation of break-fee amortisation. The need to export more newsprint out of Australasia into Asia continuously increases with declining domestic demand. The Asian newsprint price remained at historical lows. The current

<<<

 long-term price contracts in Australasia were entered at year-end 2013, while the old contracts would have expired this summer. The break fee compensations received have been amortised over the remaining duration of the old contracts.

Variable

<<<

 costs increased somewhat with higher production, while fixed costs were slightly lower due to ongoing cost improvement programs. G ross operating earnings improved slightly year-over-year, but were markedly down quarter-over-quarter. Domestic

<<<

 demand for newsprint and the Asian price level are challenging.
Demand for newsprint in Australasia decreased by around 10% in the first eight months of the year compared to the sam e period last year, while demand for magazine paper was relatively

<<<

 stable.
Capacity utilisation w as 92% in the third quarter with magazine paper production at Boyer partly offsetting the challenges posed by declining newsprint demand.

INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NORSKE SKOG

RELATED PARTIES

Some of the company's shareholders are forest owners who supply wood to the group's mills in Norway. All transactions with related parties are conducted on normal commercial terms

<<<

. No directors receive remuneration for their work for the company from any source other than the company itself.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Norske Skog conducts continuous evaluations of its operational and financial risk factors.The main risk exposures

<<<

 for the group are linked to price and volume developments for publication paper and the costs of key input factors such as energy and fibre. Currency movements and developments in the broader economic climate remain the largest uncertainties

<<<

 impacting all of the above. Challenging trading conditions currently and high financial leverage in the group amplifies the business risks. A further description of risk factors and risk management is provided in the annual financial statem

<<<

 ents for 2014.
OUTLOOK
The market balance for newsprint and magazine paper in Europe has improved following capacity closures in the industry. The industry consensus for improved pricing is supported by high operating rates across all graphic

<<<

 paper grades. This has already led to improved LWC prices and the SC market has firmed up following the introduction of US import duties on Canadian SC paper and an improved operating rate in Europe. Newsprint prices are expected to improve

<<<

 into 2016 from cash cost levels last seen in 2010. Following the

deconsolidation of Walsum and ongoing tissue conversion at Bruck, Norske Skog only has high quality a ssets left in the portfolio.
The newsprint export business out of Australasia

<<<

 is an increasing challenge as the domestic market declines and the Asian prices remain at historical lows.
Consumption of input factors is set to decrease with ongoing efficiency projects at all mills. Quarterly fixed costs should trend towards

<<<

 NOK 600 million in coming quarters.
The growth investments beyond paper are on track and will contribute to gross operating earnings from 2016. Full run-rate potential will be achieved within a timeframe of 3-4 years.
The capital structure

<<<

 of the group w as improved through enhanced liquidity, immediate de-leveraging and an extended maturity profile following the transactions completed in February 2015. The board of directors however recognizes the challenging market environment

<<<

 for both price and volume, which has reduced gross operation earnings, cash flows and equity. The board of directors monitors the situation closely and recognizes that leverage remains high and requires improved profitability and/or changes

<<<

 in the capital structure. The Board of Directors has full focus on the improving profitability and cash flow and is considering several options to address upcoming bond maturities and the high financial leverage of the group.

11 INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NORSKE SKOG

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Norske Skogindustrier ASA ("the company") and

<<<

 its subsidiaries ("the group") manufacture, distribute and sell publication paper. This includes newsprint and magazine paper.
The interim financial statem ents were authorised for issue by the board of directors in Norske Skogindustrier ASA

<<<

 on 21 October 2015.
Norske Skog's accounting treatment of em bedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway has been changed with effect from 1 January 2015.
A minor update of Norske Skog's segm ent structure, within other activities, has

<<<

 been made in the second quarter of 2015. The change

is related to the acquisition of Nature's Flame on New Zealand in June 2015. S ee Note 6 Operating segm ents for more information.
All amounts in the interim financial statem ents are presented

<<<

 in NOK million unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding, there may be differences in the summation of columns and rows.
The table below shows the applied average (un-weighted monthly) quarterly foreign exchange rates (Q3 2015 and Q2 2015) and

<<<

 the closing exchange rate (30 Septem ber 2015, 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2014) for the most important currencies for the Norske Skog group.

31 DEC 2014 6.09 9.04 11.57 5.83 7.43

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The interim financial statem ents of Norske Skog have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial

<<<

 R eporting. The interim financial statem ents do not include all information required for full annual financial statem ents, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statem ents for 2014. The interim financial statem

<<<

 ents are unaudited.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the interim financial statem ents are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statem ents for the year ended 31 December 2014, except

<<<

 for the adaptation of am ended standards and new interpretations, which are mandatory from 1 January 2015. These changes are described in the annual financial statem ents for 2014.
The group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation

<<<

 or amendment that has been issued but is not yet mandatory.

From the first quarter of 2015, Norske Skog has changed its accounting practice for em bedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway. The new accounting policy is asse sse d to

<<<

 result in financial reporting that is more aligned to the rationale for requiring separation of em bedded derivatives and will accordingly result in more relevant and less volatile information being presented to the users of the financial statem

<<<

 ents. In accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting E stim ates, 2014 figures in the condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statem ent of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated balance sheet

<<<

 and condensed consolidated statem ent of cash flows have been restated. The implementation effects of the am ended practices are further described in Note 8.

3. ESTIMATES, JUDGEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

Preparation of interim financial statem

<<<

 ents in accordance with IFRS implies use of estim ates, which are based on judgem ents and assumptions that affect the application of accounting principles and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual amounts

<<<

 might differ from such estimates.
Estimated decline in value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life and goodwill are not subject to amortisation, but are tested annually

<<<

 for impairment. Property, plant and equipment, and intangible a sse ts that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable

<<<

 amount is the higher of an asse t's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from a

cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies a weighted average cost

<<<

 of capital (WACC) model for calculating the present value of future cash flows. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates.
The challenging and deteriorated trading conditions in 2015 has increased the uncertainty in the estim ates

<<<

 to be used for calculating value in use of asse ts a s part of the annual impairment calculation. No impairments or reversal of impairments have been made at 30 September 2015.
Commodity contracts and em bedded derivatives in commodity contracts

<<<

 m easured at fair value Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 F inancial instrum ents - recognition and m easurem ent are recognised in the balance sheet and valued at fair value. Fair values of commodity

<<<

 contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity contracts which are not traded in an active marked, are assessed

NORSKE SKOG INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12

through valuation techniques. Norske Skog has one long-term energy contract in New

<<<

 Zealand. The electricity prices for long-term electricity contracts in New Zealand are not directly observable in the market for the whole contract length. Price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used in the estimation of fair

<<<

 value. The group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assum ptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
S ee Note 9 in the annual financial statem ents for 2014 for more information

<<<

 regarding the calculation of fair value of derivatives.
Provisions Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation

<<<

 a s a result of past events, an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for future environmental and dismantling liabilities are based on a number

<<<

 of assumptions made using m anagement's best

judgment. S ee Note 2 in the annual financial statem ents for 2014 for a more thorough description of important accounting estim ates and assumptions impacting the preparation of financial statem

<<<

 ents.
Contingent liabilities Norske Skog is an international company that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and contracting parties a s well a s assessm ents from public

<<<

 authorities in each country it operates.
Norske Skog has continued the process related to simplification of the group's corporate structure in 2015. The simplification of the group's corporate structure in combination with changes in individual

<<<

 countries' tax laws could increase the group's tax exposure. However, due to completed reorganisations and tax assessm ents, the overall tax exposure has decreased during the last years.

On 22 January 2015, Norske Skog launched two separate offers (i) an offering of

<<<

 EUR 290 million (EUR 179 million) Senior Secured Notes (SSN) due December 2019 and (ii) an exchange offer of existing notes.
On 24 February 2015, Norske Skog completed the refinancing of a portion of its bond maturities through the issuance

<<<

 of EUR 290 million senior secured notes (SSN) and the exchange of existing bonds into new bonds with longer maturities. Norske Skog extended the maturities on a significant portion of its indebtedness, with new notes maturing in 2019, 2021

<<<

 and 2023. The new EUR 290 million SSN mature in December 2019 and is structurally senior to all remaining existing notes and notes issued in the exchange offer. The exchange notes are structurally junior to the SSN, but structurally senior

<<<

 to remaining existing notes and mature in 2021 and 2023. The remaining existing are structurally junior to the SSN and exchange notes.
More than 75% of the existing bond holders consented to the transactions, and approximately 45% of the existing

<<<

 bonds

participated in the exchange offer. Norske Skog recognised a net gain in connection with the refinancing of NOK 869 million in first quarter 2015, included in Other financial items in the table above.
In January, prior to the offering

<<<

 of the SSN and the exchange offer, several changes in the Norske Skog corporate structure were made. Norske Skog AS w as established a s the issuer of the SSN, while Norske Skog Holding AS w as established a s the offeror of the exchange notes

<<<

.
The continued depreciation of the NOK in third quarter has impacted on the translation of debt into NOK at 30 September, resulting in unrealized currency loss. However, a weak NOK is favorable for the underlying business and the competitiveness

<<<

 of the Norwegian mills. The NOK has since quarter end appreciated.

Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists primarily of physical energy contracts. The fair value of commodity contracts is particularly sensitive to future fluctuations in energy prices. The fair value of em

<<<

 bedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations.
Higher energy prices have a positive impact on fair value. Energy prices in New Zealand have increased in the short end of the price curve while the

<<<

 prices in the long end are virtually unchanged compared with the previous quarter.
C hanges in the value of energy-/commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in contracts are presented in the income statem ent line Other gains and losses

<<<

. Realised effects from financial energy contracts are also included in this accounting line.
Gains and losses on level 3 financial instruments recognised in the income statem ent, line item Other gains and losses, amounted to NOK 78 million

<<<

 in the third quarter of 2015 (NOK -201 million in the second quarter of 2015).
Norske Skog has changed its accounting principle for embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway with effect from 1 January 2015, with full retrospective

<<<

 application. Comparable figures for 2014 have been restated. Since the change in accounting principle is applied retrospectively, the balance sheet at 1 January 2014 has been included in the interim financial statem ents in 2015.
The change

<<<

 in accounting principle regards which economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives that are considered closely related to a power purchase or sale contract between buyers and sellers in Norway. An em bedded foreign currency derivative

<<<

 is

closely related, and shall accordingly not be accounted for separately, if it is commonly used in the economic environment in which the transaction takes place. As of 1 January 2015, Norske Skog has changed its interpretation of what is

<<<

 considered an economic environment for the purpose of separation of em bedded foreign currency derivatives in non-financial contracts, so that the Norwegian and Nordic power market is considered an economic environment for these purposes. Norske

<<<

 Skog has asse sse d EUR to be a commonly used currency in the Norwegian and Nordic power market, including in long-term contracts to buy or sell physical power between buyers and sellers in this market. The energy market in Europe is further

<<<

 assessed to be an integrated economic environment where contracts to buy and sell power are commonly denominated in EUR. In addition, Norske Skog has reassessed and concluded that general inflation indexes in long-term physical energy purchase

<<<

 contracts may be considered closely related, and accordingly not required to be accounted for separately, when the purpose and effect of including them is to ensure that the prices in the contracts are adjusted to the general price level where

<<<

 the transaction takes place.
The comparable figures for 2014 in the condensed consolidated balance sheet have been restated. The following line items have been impacted in the condensed consolidated balance sheet: Deferred tax asset, Retained

<<<

 earnings and other reserves, Other non current liabilities and Other current liabilities. Retained earnings and other reserves were increased by NOK 185 million at 1 January 2014 (increased by NOK 21 million at 30 Septem ber 2014 and increased

<<<

 by NOK 212 million at 31 December 2014).

Amendment to Recent Developments
The exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum is amended to include the following paragraphs:
On March 8, 2016, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied

<<<

 Citibank N.A., London Branch's motion for a preliminary injunction and vacated the temporary restraining order originally issued on February 2, 2016.
In his order, Judge Richard J. Sullivan said that Citibank N.A., London Branch failed to demonstrate

<<<

 that noteholders would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction preventing us from consummating the Exchange Offers. We are currently reviewing the details of the order with our legal advisors and assessing any potential effects

<<<

 on the Exchange Offers.
Amendment to Expiration Deadline
The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, previously set to expire on the earlier of (i) 12:00 noon, London time, on March 11, 2016 and (ii) 12:00 noon, London time, on the business

<<<

 day following an announcement by the Parent that it has resolved to consummate the Exchange Offers on the terms set out in the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum and to accept all Relevant 2016/2017 Notes validly tendered in

<<<

 the Exchange Offers, have been extended and are now set to expire at 12:00 noon, London time, on March 21, 2016. The time and date of the Meeting of Holders of the 2017 Notes, the Announcement of Results, the Adoption of Extraordinary Resolutions

<<<

, provided that no such offer of Exchanges Notes or Ordinary Shares shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Parent or QSF Exchange Notes Issuer of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. For the purposes

<<<

 of this provision, the expression "offer of Exchange Notes to the public" or "offer of Ordinary Shares to the public" in relation to any Exchange Notes or Ordinary Shares, as applicable, in any Relevant Member State means the communication

<<<

 in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the Offering and the Exchange Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Exchange Notes or Ordinary Shares, as such expression

<<<

 may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State.

A m endm ent to T he T ransactions-- T he E xchange O ffers and T ransactions
The exchange offer and consent solicitation m em orandum is amended by replacing

<<<

 the existing last three paragraphs of the section by the following paragraphs:
U nder the Support Agreement, GSO and Cyrus com m itted to tender their holdings o f the 2017 Notes in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, w hich holdings

<<<

 (together w ith the 2017 Notes that have been acquired from the Parent) represent 68.2%, respectively, o f the outstanding 2017 Notes. GSO and Cyrus subsequently acquired the P aren t's treasury holdings and have tendered th eir 2017 N otes

<<<

 in the E xchange O ffers. A s o f M arch 17, 2016, the Parent had received tenders o f more than 75% o f the 2017 Notes, and had received consents in respect o f the Proposals o f over 75% (which is the threshold required to pass the Proposals

<<<

 and thus bind all o f the outstanding 2017 Notes to the terms of the Proposals).
O n February 2, 2016, the New Y ork State Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order preventing the closing o f the Exchange Offers. The temporary restraining

<<<

 order had been requested by Citibank, N.A., London Branch in its capacity as trustee under the indenture (the "I n d e n tu r e ") fo r the Senior Secured N otes (the "P la in tif f '). A fter the defendants in this action rem oved the case

<<<

 to federal court, on M arch 8, 2016, the U nited States D istrict Court for the Southern D istrict Court o f New Y ork issued an O rder No. 16-cv-850 (RJS)(the "O rd e r") denying the m otion o f the Plaintiff for a preliminary injunction to

<<<

 prevent the closing of the Exchange Offers, on the basis that the Plaintiff had not dem onstrated that it would suffer irreparable harm in the absence o f the requested injunction. The Order also lifted the tem porary restraining order in respect

<<<

 o f the Exchange Offers that had been im posed by the N ew Y ork State Supreme Court on February 2, 2016.
In its O rder denying the injunction, the Court found prelim inarily, on the lim ited record before it, that the Plaintiff had show n

<<<

 a sufficient likelihood that it w ould be successful in proving, after a full trial on the merits o f its claim, that the proposed Exchange Offer, if consummated, would violate a term o f the Indenture. The Parent strenuously disagrees with

<<<

 this interpretation o f the Indenture, and the Parent will vigorously contest this view if and w hen appropriate. A m ong other things, the Parent notes that the Court was presented only w ith the question as to w hether the Plaintiff had show

<<<

 n a likelihood o f success or serious questions going to the merits o f its proffered interpretations o f the Indenture to make them fair ground for litigation, all based upon the highly expedited and limited prelim inary injunction record

<<<

 before the court. A s such, the P arent notes th at the C o u rt's prelim inary observations did not constitute a final determ ination by the Court on the matter, w hich would be the subject o f a future trial on the
3

merits.
Nevertheless

<<<

, due to the present uncertainty w ith respect to the court case and the com pelling need o f the Com pany to undertake a transaction to resolve uncertainties regarding its liquidity and upcom ing m aturities as expeditiously as possible and

<<<

 before any trials on the merits, the Parent has decided to am end the terms o f the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. As described above, the Parent entered into the Am ended Support Agreem ent w ith G SO and Cyrus, w hich w as approved

 by the P a re n t's B oard o f D irectors. O n M arch 18, 2016, the P arent term inated the Exchange Offer in respect o f the 2016 Notes, amended the Exchange Notes Consideration in respect of the 2017 Notes and waived the m inim um tender

 condition in respect o f the 2017 Notes. Based on the level o f tenders and consents received to date, the Parent presently does not intend to extend the E xpiration D eadline o f A pril 6, 2016 and, follow ing the E xpiration D eadline, the

 expenditures and servicing o f interest on indebtedness, present the Group with significant liquidity challenges in 2016. As described under the caption "R ecen t Developments'", the P arent has entered into the Financing Agreement w ith GSO

If the Exchange

 Offer and Consent Solicitations are not completed and the liquidity measures contemplated by the Financing A greem ent are not available, the very m aterial uncertainty surrounding the G roup's liquidity p o sitio n in 2016 and 2017 may cause

 and/or require the officers and directors o f subsidiary operating com panies in the Group to consider w hether they can continue to provide monies to the Parent, w hich the Parent relies upon to satisfy its liabilities. Likewise, if the Exchange

 O ffer and Consent Solicitations are not completed and the liquidity measures contemplated by the Financing A greem ent are not available, the P aren t's independent auditors w ould likely issue an audit o p inion on our D ecem ber 31, 201

If the Exchange O ffer and Consent Solicitations are not completed and the Parent is not

 able to obtain other sources o f liquidity in an am ount necessary to m eet the June 15, 2016 m aturity date o f the 2016 N otes (none o f w hich sources are presently foreseen), the Parent is likely to default on such paym ent causing the

 Parent (and other Norw egian subsidiaries) to need to seek applicable relief under Norw egian law. The available N orw egian processes have a poor track record o f rehabilitating com panies o f the G roup's size and com plexity and instead

 o ften result in a liquidation, w hich in the G ro u p 's case, w ould have to occur across several jurisd ictio n s and w ould dram atically im pair recoveries fo r the G ro u p 's creditors. There can be no assurance th at the E xchange O

 herein and are available at http://www.norskeskog.com/People-and-press/Press-room/Newsarchive/English-archive.aspx.
O n M arch 18, 2015, the Parent released the follow ing trading update and outlook for the six months ending June 30, 2016:

<<<


"No consolidated financial statements have been prepared for any period in 2016. The inform ation in this trading update and outlook in respect of 1H16 is based on preliminary internal m anagement accounts and includes estimates and

assum

<<<

 ptions, and is subject to change as the gro u p 's consolidated financial statem ents are finalized, as further described herein. Undue reliance should not be placed on the inform ation in this statement.
P&L
The prices for publication paper

<<<

 in Europe have im proved year-to-date from the level experienced in 2H15. Seasonally lower sales volumes in the first half o f the year compared to the second half are expected to offset the positive price effect to a certain degree. Prices

<<<

 in Australasia have remained relatively stable year-to-date from 2H15, reflecting a higher export share offsetting im proved Asian newsprint prices. Sales volum es in Australasia are also expected to be seasonally low er in the first half com

<<<

 pared to the second half. A one-off cost benefit in Australasia in the fourth quarter of last year supported GOE in 2H15.
Year-to-date, N OK has on average been stronger to GBP and w eaker to EU R and USD com pared to 2H15. AUD has on average

<<<

 been stronger to N OK and som ewhat w eaker to USD. Underlying fixed costs continue to trend down and variable costs are positively im pacted by low er energy costs. O ther activities, a cost centre supporting the business units, were positively

<<<

 impacted by year-end effects in 2H15.
Cashflow
Cash flow from operations are expected to be positive before interest payments in 1H16, despite a seasonal build of working capital. Capital expenditures in 1H16 are expected to be at sim ilar

<<<

 levels to the reported figure for 2H15. The G roup's cash and cash equivalent balances at the end o f February 2016 w as in the range o f N O K 500 million.
Balance sheet
A successful com pletion o f the proposed equity and liquidity initiatives

<<<

 and the exchange offer to 2017 note holders would significantly improve cash balances and equity level for the group. The contem plated transactions, if completed, would also directly enhance liquidity through reduced cash interest payments

<<<

. To allow for daily volatility in working capital, the group needs a liquidity buffer o f around NOK 200 million beyond restricted cash o f approximately NOK 250 million.
Reported debt will, if the current NO K appreciation to EU R and USD

<<<

 from year-end were to rem ain unchanged, decrease somewhat. This positive translation effect would mitigate the negative equity effect from interest and depreciation charges through the P&L. The com pletion o f the proposed exchange offer to

<<<

 2017 note holders would significantly reduce reported debt.
Outlook
The market balance for newsprint and magazine paper in Europe is continuing to im prove with recent announcements o f capacity closures adding to the benefits experienced from

<<<

 closures last year. This gives m om entum to the positive pricing environment. Gross operating earnings (GOE) for the first six months o f 2016 is expected to be above NOK 500 million. Reflecting closures and planned conversion projects out

<<<

 o f publication paper in the industry, European operating rates for newsprint and LW C are expected to rem ain above 90% in both 2016 and 2017, after taking into account an expected secular decline in demand.
The European SC m arket is gaining

<<<

 support from closures in North America. The Asian export market for newsprint, of increasing im portance to Norske Skog due to a sm aller domestic m arket in Australasia, is encouraging with prices improving. Favourable energy costs for our

<<<

 European mills and efficiency measures at all mills are expected to reduce variable costs by 2-3% per tonne in 2016. Fixed costs initiatives continue at all mills towards a run-rate group level o f NO K 600 m illion per quarter by year-end

 2016. The growth initiatives announced last year are expected to start to contribute to gross operating earnings this year and are expected to reach full run-rate w ithin a timeframe o f 3-4 years."
