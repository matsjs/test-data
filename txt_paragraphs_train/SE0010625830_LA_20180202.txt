STATUS OF THE NOTES
The Notes are denominated in Swedish Kronor and each Note is constituted by these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Notes and to comply with these Terms

<<<

 and Conditions.
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such agreement.
The nominal amount

<<<

 of each Initial Note is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Initial Notes as at the First Issue Date is SEK 400,000,000. All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of one

<<<

 hundred (100) per cent. of the Nominal Amount.

Execution version 14(50)

2.4

The Issuer may, on one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes provided that the

Financial Indebtedness under such Subsequent Notes constitutes Permitted

<<<

 Debt (for the

avoidance of doubt, including that it shall meet the Incurrence Test). Subsequent Notes

shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of

doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the currency

<<<

, the nominal amount and the final maturity

applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The issue price of the

Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal

Amount. The maximum aggregate

<<<

 nominal amount of the Notes (the Initial Notes and all

Subsequent Notes) may not exceed SEK 600,000,000 unless a consent from the

Noteholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 17.7. Each Subsequent Note shall

entitle its holder to Interest

<<<

 in accordance with Clause 9.1, and otherwise have the same

rights as the Initial Notes.

2.5

The Notes constitute direct, general, unconditional and secured obligations of the Issuer

and shall at all times rank (i) behind the Super Senior

<<<

 Facility and the Super Senior Hedges

pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) pari passu without any preference

among them, and (iii) at least pari passu with all other direct, unconditional,

unsubordinated and unsecured

<<<

<<<

Issuer or a Guarantor to the Noteholders under or in relation to the Notes or a Guarantee

(notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary in these Terms and Conditions

<<<

) other

than in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the

failure by the Issuer or a Guarantor to timely make any payments due under the Notes or a

Guarantee shall constitute an Event of Default and the

<<<

 unpaid amount shall carry default

interest pursuant to Clause 9.4. If and when the Payment Block Event ceases to exist, the

Issuer and/or the Guarantor shall, for the avoidance of doubt, immediately make the

payments and/or repurchases they

<<<

 should have done in relation to the Notes or a Guarantee

should the Payment Block Event not have occurred (together with the default interest

referred to above).

2.7

In case of insolvency of the Issuer, the payment obligations of the Issuer

<<<

 under the Notes

are subordinated to other payment obligations of the Issuer under the Super Senior Facility

and the Super Senior Hedges pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

2.8

The Notes are freely transferable but the Noteholders may

<<<

 be subject to purchase or

transfer restrictions with regard to the Notes, as applicable, under local laws to which a

Noteholder may be subject. Each Noteholder must ensure compliance with such

restrictions at its own cost and expense.



<<<

2.9

No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public

offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other

material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any

<<<

 jurisdiction other than Sweden, where

action for that purpose is required, and as such the Notes have not been and will not be

registered, and may be restricted, in United States, Australia, Japan, Canada, or in any

other country where the

<<<

 offering, sale and delivery of the Notes may be restricted by law.

Each Noteholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the

transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Notes.
