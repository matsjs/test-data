 Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect of any action which it took

<<<

 or failed to take whilst acting as Agent. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Noteholders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under the Finance Documents as they would have had if such successor had been the

<<<

 original Agent.
In the event that there is a change of the Agent in accordance with this Clause 20.4, the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Agent may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new

<<<

 Agent the rights, powers and obligation of the Agent and releasing the retiring Agent from its further obligations under the Finance Documents and the Agency Agreement. Unless the Issuer and the new Agent agrees otherwise, the new Agent shall

<<<

 be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Agent.
Appointment and Replacement of the Issuing Agent
The Issuer appoints the Issuing Agent to manage certain specified tasks under these Terms and Conditions and in accordance

<<<

 with the legislation, rules and regulations applicable to and/or issued by the CSD and relating to the Notes.
The Issuing Agent may retire from its assignment or be dismissed by the Issuer, provided that the Issuer has approved that a commercial

<<<

 bank or securities institution approved by the CSD accedes as new Issuing Agent at the same time as the old Issuing Agent retires or is dismissed. If the Issuing Agent is Insolvent, the Issuer shall immediately appoint a new Issuing Agent,

<<<

 which shall replace the old Issuing Agent as issuing agent in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

No Direct Actions by Noteholders
A Noteholder may not take any steps whatsoever against

<<<

 the Issuer to enforce or recover any amount due or owing to it pursuant to the Finance Documents, or to initiate, support or procure the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw. företagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy

<<<

 (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer in relation to any of the liabilities of the Issuer under the Finance Documents.
Clause 22.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Noteholders in accordance

<<<

 with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Noteholder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 20.1.2), such actions within a reasonable

<<<

 period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance Documents or the Agency Agreement

<<<

 or by any reason described in Clause 20.2.7, such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 20.2.8 before a Noteholder may take any action referred to in Clause 22.1.
The provisions of Clause

<<<

 22.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Noteholder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 10.5 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change o f Control Event or a Listing Failure) or other payments which are due

<<<

 by the Issuer to some but not all Noteholders.
Prescription
The right to receive repayment of the principal of the Notes shall be prescribed and become void ten (10) years from the Redemption Date. The right to receive payment of interest 

<<<

(excluding any capitalised interest) shall be prescribed and become void three (3) years from the relevant due date for payment. The Issuer is entitled to any funds set aside for payments in respect of which the Noteholders' right to receive

<<<

 payment has been prescribed and has become void.
If a limitation period is duly interrupted in accordance with the Swedish Act on Limitations (Sw. preskriptionslag (1981:130)), a new limitation period of ten (10) years with respect to the right

<<<

 to receive repayment of the principal of the Notes, and of three (3) years with respect to receive payment of interest (excluding capitalised interest) will commence, in both cases calculated from the date of interruption of the limitation

<<<

 period, as such date is determined pursuant to the provisions of the Swedish Act on Limitations.

<<<

 specified in Clause 24.1.1 or, in case of email to the Agent or the Issuer, when received in legible form by the email address specified in Clause 24.1.1.
Failure to send a notice or other communication to a Noteholder or any defect in it shall

<<<

 not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Noteholders.
Press releases

In addition to Clause 24.2.1, if any information relating to the Notes or the Issuer contained in a notice the Agent may send to the Noteholders under these Terms and Conditions

<<<

 has not already been made public by way of a press release, the Agent shall before it sends such information to the Noteholders give the Issuer the opportunity to issue a press release containing such information. If the Issuer does not promptly

<<<

 issue a press release and the Agent considers it necessary to issue a press release containing such information before it can lawfully send a notice containing such information to the Noteholders, the Agent shall be entitled to issue such press

<<<

 release.
Force Majeure and Limitation of Liability
Neither the Agent nor the Issuing Agent shall be held responsible for any damage arising out of any legal enactment, or any measure taken by a public authority, or war, strike, lockout, boycott

<<<

, blockade or any other similar circumstance (a "Force Majeure Event"). The reservation in respect of strikes, lockouts, boycotts and blockades applies even if the Agent or the Issuing Agent itself takes such measures, or is subject to such
