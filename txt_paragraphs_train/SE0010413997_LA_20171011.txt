 OF THE NOTES
The Notes are denominated in Euro and each Note is constituted by these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Notes and to comply with these Terms and Conditions.

<<<

0,000 (the "Initial Nominal Amount"). The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Initial Notes as at the First Issue Date is EUR 310,000,000. All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 per cent. of the Initial

<<<

 Nominal Amount.
Provided that at the time of issuance, the Issuer meets the Incurrence Test (tested pro forma including such incurrence), the Issuer may, on one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes. Subsequent Notes shall benefit from

<<<

 and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the currency, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The issue price

<<<

 of the Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Notes (the Initial Notes and all Subsequent Notes) may not exceed EUR 400,000,000 unless a consent

<<<

 from the Noteholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 18.7(a). Each Subsequent Note shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 10.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Notes.
The Notes constitute direct

<<<

 as otherwise provided in the Finance Documents.
