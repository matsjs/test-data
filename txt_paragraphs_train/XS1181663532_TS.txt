 all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should

INDUSTRY AND MARKET INFORMATION The information contained in ``Exchange Rates'', ``Summary'', ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" , ``Industry and Market Overview

<<<

" and ``Business" includes extracts from information and data, including industry and market data and estimates from publicly available resources and industry and market consultants. Although we believe such sources to be reliable and we accept

<<<

 responsibility for the accurate extraction and reproduction of such information and data, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified the accuracy of such information and data and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers

<<<

 accept further responsibility in respect thereof. In particular, information and data contained in these listing particulars relating to the publication paper industry and certain economic measures have been extracted or derived from reports

, presentations or other sources produced by, among others, the Pulp and Paper Products Council (" PPPC" ) and Resource Information System, Inc. (" RISI"). The accuracy of such information is subject to the availability and reliability of the

<<<

 data supporting such information and neither the published information nor the underlying data has been independently verified by us. In addition, the methodology of each of PPPC and RISI and of other industry sources for collecting, analyzing

<<<

 and presenting information and data, and therefore the reported information, may differ from that used by us to compile data relating to our operations and from the methodologies employed by other industry consultants and participants. Each

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION
Financial Data
These listing particulars includes the audited consolidated financial information of the Parent as of and for the years ended December 31,2011,2012, 2013 and 201

<<<

4 (together, the ``Audited Consolidated Financial Statements''). These listing particulars also includes the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of the Parent as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (with September

<<<

 30, 2013 comparative financial information) (the ``Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements'' and, together with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the ``Consolidated Financial Statements''). For purposes of these listing

<<<

 particulars, references to ``our'' financial information or results of operations refer to the financial information or results of operations of the Parent.
The Consolidated Financial Statements included in these listing particulars have been

<<<

 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (``IFRS'') as adopted by the European Union and are presented in Norwegian kroner. The Parent is the holding company of the Group and will provide a senior Guarantee of

<<<

 the Notes. The Parent's shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ``NSG''. Under the reporting covenant for the Notes, the Parent will be the reporting entity for the Group. See ``Description of the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes-- Certain Covenants-- Reports" .
The Senior Secured Notes Issuer was formed on November 18, 2014 and the Exchange Notes Issuer was formed on November 5, 2014 for the purpose of facilitating this Offering, the Escrow Release, the Proposed

<<<

 Exchange Offers and the Proposed Consent Solicitations (collectively, the ``Transactions''). The Exchange Notes Issuer is the direct subsidiary of Norske Treindustrier AS, which is the direct subsidiary of the Parent. The Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 Issuer is the direct subsidiary of the Exchange Notes Issuer. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Exchange Notes Issuer will have no revenue generating or operating assets of their own, other than, in the case of the Exchange Notes Issuer

<<<

, the ownership of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the ownership of the shares of its subsidiaries. We have not prepared, and do not present in these listing particulars, consolidated

<<<

 or unconsolidated financial statements for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Exchange Notes Issuer. See ``Summary--Summary Corporate Structure and Financing". The results of operations and financial condition of the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 Issuer and of the Exchange Notes Issuer may differ from the results of operations and the financial condition of the Parent, including without limitation, due to the impact of results of certain operating subsidiaries of the Parent that are

<<<

 not consolidated subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or of the Exchange Notes Issuer.
Our unaudited consolidated statement of income data for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 has been derived by adding our historical consolidated

<<<

 statement of income data for the financial year ended December 31, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and subtracting our historical consolidated statement of income data for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
IFRS differs

<<<

 in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (``U.S. GAAP''). The Parent has not prepared and does not currently intend to prepare its Consolidated Financial Statements in, or reconcile them to, U.S

<<<

. GAAP Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
The financial information included in these listing particulars is not intended to comply with the

<<<

 reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC.
Pro Forma Financial Information
We present in these listing particulars certain unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information as at and for the twelve

<<<

 months ended September 30, 2014 on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions, including the issuance of the Notes and the assumed application of the net proceeds in the Proposed Exchange Offers. For a description of certain of

<<<

 the assumptions made with respect to the application of the net proceeds of the Offering in the Proposed Exchange Offers, see ``Summary-- The Transactions-- The Proposed Exchange Offers'' and ``Use of Proceeds" . The unaudited pro forma financial

<<<

 information set forth in these listing particulars is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ from the actual adjusted amounts.
xi

Our unaudited pro forma financial

<<<

 data presented herein has been prepared for informational purposes only, and does not purport to represent what our actual financial position or consolidated interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on (i) September 3

<<<

0, 2014, for the purposes of the calculation of pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities and pro forma secured net interest-bearing liabilities and (ii) October 1,2013, for the purposes of the calculation of pro forma net finance costs, nor

<<<

 does it purport to represent our consolidated interest expense or actual financial position at any future date. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future results following the consummation of the Transactions. The unaudited

<<<

 pro forma financial data presented in these listing particulars has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards.
Rounding
Certain amounts that

<<<

 appear in these listing particulars, including financial data and operating data, have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede

<<<

 them and amounts expressed as percentages may not total 100% when aggregated.
Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures
In the income statement of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we present gross operating earnings for the Group, and in

<<<

 our segment reporting, we assess the performance of our operating segments based on a measure of gross operating earnings. Gross operating earnings excludes the effects of expenditure not deemed to be part of regular operating activities. Gross

<<<

 operating earnings represents operating earnings before depreciation, restructuring expenses, other gains and losses (such as gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in the fair value of certain energy contracts and biological

<<<

 assets) and impairments. In the section of these listing particulars titled ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" , we discuss the operating performance of the Group and our operating segments

<<<

 based on gross operating earnings, which measure is presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In certain other sections of these listing particulars, including ``Summary" and ``Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data" , we use

<<<

 the term ``EBITDA'', as defined below, in lieu of the term gross operating earnings due to the familiarity of the term EBITDA to prospective investors in the Notes. In these listing particulars, EBITDA is defined on the same basis as gross

<<<

 operating earnings. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit/loss, see ``Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data" .
These listing particulars present non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA, capital expenditures, cash conversion

<<<

, net secured interest-bearing liabilities, net interest-bearing debt, pro forma secured net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma finance costs and the related leverage and coverage ratios calculated

<<<

 using such non-IFRS measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other

<<<

 interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation

<<<

 or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios such as EBITDA, capital expenditures, cash conversion, net interest-bearing debt, net secured interest-bearing liabilities, pro

<<<

 forma secured net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma financial costs and the related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other

<<<

 generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently and, consequently, our presentation may not be readily comparable to other companies' figures. In particular, you should not

<<<

 consider EBITDA or cash conversion as an alternative to (a) operating earnings or profit/loss for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing

<<<

 activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. EBITDA, capital expenditures, cash conversion, net secured interest-bearing liabilities,

<<<

 net interest-bearing debt, pro forma secured net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma finance costs, and the related leverage and coverage ratios have limitations as analytical tools, and you should

<<<

 not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS.
xii

Constant Perimeter Financial Information
We present in these listing particulars certain financial information that our management

<<<

 has prepared on a ``constant perimeter'' basis, which includes only the historical operating results of our eight currently operational mills, Bruck, Golbey, Skogn, Albury, Boyer, Tasman, Walsum and Saugbrugs (the ``Constant Perimeter Financial

<<<

 Information'') that has neither been audited nor reviewed by our independent auditors. See ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Factors Affecting Comparability-Significant disposals or reductions

<<<

 in capacity" .
The purpose of presenting such Constant Perimeter Financial Information is for informational purposes only and solely to assist prospective investors in assessing the comparability of our financial results during the periods

<<<

 under review. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information has been prepared by our management based on a compilation of financial data from our Consolidated Financial Statements and our management accounts. Due to the nature of such Constant

<<<

 Perimeter Financial Information, our management has made certain adjustments, assumptions and estimates in the preparation of such information. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information does not reflect results from our operations recorded

<<<

 as Other Activities in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which would require significant further adjustments and assumptions due to the difficulties in allocating revenues and costs to appropriate assets given the changes to the Group

<<<

's structure. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information does not purport to represent pro forma financial information and has not been prepared in accordance with the procedures of IFRS, any other generally accepted accounting procedures

<<<

 or the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act and has not been audited or reviewed under any generally accepted auditing standards. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information is not intended to represent or to be indicative

<<<

 of the consolidated results of operations that we would have reported had the disposals of our Pisa, Singburi, Bio Bio, Follum, Parenco and Reparco operations occurred on January 1, 2011.
See ``Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and

<<<

 Our Industry-- The Constant Perimeter Financial Information included in these listing particulars has been compiled from non-IFRS financial data based on certain assumptions, adjustments and estimates made by our management and is unaudited

<<<

 and unreviewed by our auditors.''
The Constant Perimeter Financial Information was prepared on the following basis:
 the results of the disposed businesses have been excluded for all periods prior to their disposition;
 the results of our

<<<

 current portfolio of mills are based on unaudited and unreviewed management accounts for the relevant period and no adjustments have been made for the discontinuance of certain operations at our Walsum and Tasman mills in 2013 (see ``Management

<<<

's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Factors Affecting Comparability-- Significant disposals or reductions in capacity"); and
 the results of the continuing operations have not been adjusted to reflect

<<<

 any increases or decreases of revenue or increases or decreases in costs that may have been incurred had the disposals identified in ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Factors Affecting

<<<

 Comparability--Significant disposals or reductions in capacity" actually taken place on January 1, 2011.
Production Capacity
We estimate production capacity using the production capacity of our mills as a demonstrated maximum production output

<<<

 (in tons per year) which we derive by annualizing (based on 362 days) the average saleable paper production output (in tons per hour) from the three calendar months with the highest production volumes over the last twelve-month period that

<<<

 have a capacity utilization rate of greater than 90%. Our estimates of production capacity are unaudited and involve significant estimates and assumptions made by our management.
We use an average saleable production (in tons per hour) of the

<<<

 three calendar months with the highest production volumes in a twelve-month period as we believe it represents an accurate approximation of the maximum capabilities of the equipment and processes, and a repeatable high-performance production

<<<

 rate, given the same conditions. We use months in which we achieve a capacity utilization rate of greater than 90% because we believe these represent periods when minimum external factors,
xiii

such as scheduled stops for maintenance or holidays

<<<

, have interrupted the normal operation of paper production. We use 362-day years because time is required each year to perform work that can only be done during a paper machine stop. Paper machine shutdowns for operational and maintenance reasons

<<<

 are part of normal operations and are not intended to be included in our estimates. With effect from January 1,2011, we implemented a new calculation for the measurement of capacity at all of our mills, which assumes a lower paper weight (as

<<<

 measured in gsm) produced at the relevant mill. This change was introduced in response to a general trend towards thinner and lighter paper, particularly in Europe. This change affects the comparability of capacity figures for periods prior

<<<

 to January 1,2011 as the new system for measuring capacity results in small differences in the capacity at certain of our mills.
xiv

EXCHANGE RATES
The functional currency of the Parent and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial

<<<

 Statements included in these listing particulars is the Norwegian krone. Certain of our indebtedness is denominated in Euro and, to a lesser extent, U.S. dollars and Australian dollars and certain of our subsidiaries use a functional currency

<<<

 and a presentation currency other than the Norwegian krone that must be translated into Norwegian kroner for the purpose of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. See the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere

<<<

 in these listing particulars for a description of the methodology we use to translate our financial position and results of operations from U.S. dollars or Euro to Norwegian kroner.
The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated

<<<

, certain information concerning the exchange rates for Norwegian kronor expressed in NOK per U.S.$1.00 and in NOK per 1.00, in each case based upon the Bloomberg Composite Rate and rounded to four decimal places. The Bloomberg Composite Rate

<<<

 is a ``best market'' calculation in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite

<<<

 Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. ``Average'' means the average of the exchange rates on the last business day of each month for annual averages and the average of the exchange rates on each

<<<

 business day during the relevant period for monthly averages. These exchange rates are provided only for the convenience of the reader. No representation is made that amounts in U.S.$ or  have been, could have been or could be converted into

<<<

 NOK, or vice versa.
As of March 19, 2015, the Bloomberg Composite Rate was NOK 8.1017 per U.S.$1.00 and NOK 8.6159 per 1.00.
The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain information concerning the exchange rates for NOK

<<<

, expressed in NOK per U.S.$1.00. The rates set forth below are provided solely for your convenience and were not used by us in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in these listing particulars. No representation

<<<

 is made that U.S.$ could have been, or could be, converted into NOK at that rate or at any other rate.

Overview
We are a leading global publication paper company with

<<<

 total production capacity of 3.0 million tons at our eight mills in Europe and Australasia. We are one of the world's leading producers of newsprint and are a significant producer of magazine paper by production capacity. In Europe, we operate

<<<

 five mills in Norway, Germany, Austria and France with 2.3 million tons of publication paper production capacity, making us the third largest European producer of publication paper. In Australasia (which includes Australia, New Zealand, New

<<<

 Guinea and the neighboring islands), we operate two mills in Australia and one mill in New Zealand with 0.7 million tons of publication paper production capacity. We also operate Australasia's sole newsprint and magazine paper mills, making

<<<

 us a leading provider of publication paper in the region.
Our newsprint paper products include standard and improved grades, while our magazine paper products comprise uncoated super-calendared paper and light-weight coated paper. The end uses

<<<

 of our products are mainly newspapers and magazines, but also include catalogs, inserts/flyers, supplements, free-sheets, directories, direct mail and brochures. Our principal geographic markets for newsprint products are Europe and Australasia

<<<

, while our main geographic markets for magazine paper products are Europe, Australasia and North America. We sell our products in these markets under well-known brands, including Nornews, Norbright, NorX, Norstar, Norcote, Norsc, Norbook, Vantage

<<<

 and Tasman Directory. Our customers include publishers of leading periodicals in Europe, Australasia and the rest of the world, and we have long-standing relationships with many of our top tier publishing clients.
For the nine months ended

<<<

 September 30, 2014, we estimate that our market shares, based on deliveries for newsprint and magazine paper in Europe, were approximately 13% and 7%, respectively, and that our share of sales by volume for newsprint in Australasia was approximately

<<<

 83%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, approximately 55% of our operating revenues from the sale of publication paper in Australasia were generated from customers with whom we have long-term contractual arrangements.
Over the

<<<

 last five years, as a result of a strategic refocus, we have streamlined our business through a broad range of operational initiatives and investments, which we believe have positioned our business to improve its profitability and cash flow

<<<

 generation.
Across our Group, we have implemented continuous cost-improvement initiatives, including headcount reductions and working capital management measures, to improve our cash flow. Such measures include the increased use of receivables

<<<

 financings as well as our recent investment in and completion of a thermo-mechanical pulp, or TMP facility at our Saugbrugs mill, which we expect to reduce electricity costs.
In Europe, we have improved our operating portfolio, retaining our

<<<

 best assets while strategically reducing underperforming capacity. We sold our Follum and Parenco mills in 2012, and closed one paper machine at our Walsum mill in 2013. In Australasia, we have maintained revenue visibility and stability by

<<<

 amending and prolonging long-term contracts with the region's two largest consumers of publication paper, securing stable revenues for our future. At the same time, we have diversified our Australasian product mix through the addition of magazine

<<<

 paper production capacity at our Boyer mill, where we are now the region's sole magazine paper producer.
We expect our past investments, when coupled with our renewed focus on key customer geographies, in Europe, where our customers are concentrated

<<<

 in the region's four largest economies, and in Australasia, where we are the leading producer, will enable us to benefit from anticipated improvements in the market for our products. In particular, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit

<<<

 from any future

declines in aggregate publication paper production capacity, any future increases in publication paper prices and any future improvements in publication paper mill utilization rates.
For the twelve months ended Septem ber

<<<

 30, 2014, we generated NOK 12,476 million (1,509 million) of consolidated operating revenue and NOK 910 million (110 million) of consolidated EBITDA. Our Publication Paper Europe segment, our Publication Paper Australasia segment and our Other

Our production and sales activities are predom inantly divided in accordance with our reporting segments:

 Europe: in Europe, we operate five mills, including two in Norway, one in France, one in Germany

<<<

 and one in Austria:

 Bruck (Austria): our Bruck mill produces both newsprint and coated mechanical paper, or LWC, with an annual production capacity of 120,000 tons and 260,000 tons, respectively.

 Golbey (France): our Golbey mill is one

<<<

 of the leading newsprint mills in Europe, with an annual production capacity of 615,000 tons, and is strategically located in France, within easy reach of major European cities and close to important raw material supplies.

 Saugbrugs (Norway

<<<

): our Saugbrugs mill is one of the largest and most modern producers of uncoated mechanical paper, or SC, in the world with an annual production capacity of 530,000 tons.

2

 Skogn (Norway): our Skogn mill is the largest producer of newsprint

<<<

 in Norway with an annual production capacity of 565,000 tons. The mill serves customers worldwide, has its own port facilities and operates a route twice-a-week to the UK and Continental Europe.
 Walsum (Germany): our Walsum mill operates

<<<

 a PM 10 paper machine with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons of SC.
 Australasia: in Australasia, we operate three mills, including two in Australia and one in New Zealand:
 Albury (Australia): our Albury mill has an annual production

<<<

 capacity of 270,000 tons, which is approximately 77% of the newsprint grades used in Australia each year. The Albury mill uses up to 35% recycled fiber, which is produced in Australia's first large scale newsprint de-inking facility that recycles

<<<

 around 100,000 tons of old newspapers and magazines each year. Albury is located in New South Wales, between Sydney and Melbourne.
 Boyer (Australia): our Boyer mill has an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons of newsprint and 140,0

<<<

00 tons of LWC, which was partially converted in 2014 to produce coated mechanical paper.
 Tasman (New Zealand): our Tasman mill supplies all of New Zealand's newsprint and telephone directory requirements, with export production throughout

<<<

 Asia and the South Pacific. The mill has an annual production capacity of 155,000 tons of newsprint.
Publication Paper Industry Trends
Europe
We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from any price increases in the European publication

<<<

 paper sector. According to RISI forecasts, publication paper prices are expected to demonstrate a mixed development in 2015, with decreasing prices in the first half of the year, followed by increasing prices in the second half of the year

<<<

. The price increases across all grades are expected to continue further in 2016. By the end of 2015, as compared to price levels at the end of 2014, Western European SC prices are expected to increase by 3.2%, LWC prices are expected to increase

<<<

 by 4.2% and newsprint prices are expected to decrease by 0.6%. In 2016, RISI expects average prices to increase by 5.1% in newsprint, 5.1% in SC and 5.9% in LWC from average 2015 price levels. We believe these forecasts imply that the publication

<<<

 paper sector is showing signs of stabilization from current pricing levels, despite somewhat mixed developments for 2015. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of print for publishers' revenue generation, publishers' investment in print

<<<

 sites, a stabilization of the decline of global publication paper demand and anticipated reductions in overcapacity will be factors that will influence positive pricing trends during the next few years.
According to PPPC, Western European newsprint

<<<

 demand declined by 4.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period, 5.8% in 2013 and 10.6% in 2012. Uncoated mechanical paper demand declined by 5.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared

<<<

 to the prior year period, and 1.6% in 2013 and 5.1% in 2012. Coated mechanical paper demand declined by 3.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to the prior year period, and 7.8% in 2013 and 8.9% in 2012. On the supply side

<<<

, there have been significant capacity closures in recent years, with additional closures set to occur during the first quarter of 2015 following UPM Kymmene Corporation's (``UPM'') announced closure of approximately 800,000 tons of publication

<<<

 paper capacity in November 2014 and previous announcements of approximately 580,000 tons of capacity closure by other industry players, including Stora Enso Oyj (``Stora Enso''). We believe these industry dynamics are factors that could contribute

<<<

 to higher utilization rates and a potential improvement in the pricing environment in Europe.
Australasia
Similar to Europe, through September 30, 2014, the rate of decline of newsprint demand in Australasia fell to 6.1%, compared to 17.1%

<<<

 in 2013 and 11.9% in 2012. In response to reduced demand, we have significantly reduced newsprint capacity in the region by permanently closing one of our two paper machines at our Tasman mill in 2013, which had an annual newsprint capacity

<<<

 of 160,000 tons, and converting one of the paper machines at our Boyer mill from newsprint to coated mechanical, reducing newsprint capacity in the region by an additional 120,000 tons while adding 140,000 of LWC capacity.
3

In recent years

<<<

, the import of publication paper into Australasia has been on a downward trend. Imports of newsprint decreased by 18.7% in 2012 and 9.2% in 2013, with no significant change in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year

<<<

 period, while imports of coated mechanical decreased by 0.3% in 2012 and increased by 4.9% in 2013. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, imports of coated mechanical declined by 20.9%. We believe this decrease in imports of newsprint

<<<

 and coated mechanical is, in part, the result of the conversion of one of the paper machines at our Boyer mill. As the sole producer in the region, we believe we have an advantage over our competitors who must incur transportation costs in

<<<

 order to access the market. According to PPPC, demand for coated mechanical declined by 12.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period, following an increase of 4.4% in 2013. Because demand for coated mechanical

<<<

 remains significantly higher than local capacity following the conversion of our paper machine at our Boyer mill, we believe utilization rates will remain high. The uncoated mechanical market is covered solely by imports.
Competitive and Credit

<<<

 Strengths
We believe that we benefit from the following competitive and credit strengths:
Strong market positions in Australasia and Europe
We are the sole producer of newsprint and magazine paper in Australasia, where we have a leading position

<<<

 in a concentrated newsprint and magazine paper market and compete only against imports. In Europe, we are the third largest producer of publication paper and we export products to North America, Asia and North Africa, which are our most important

<<<

 export destinations from Europe. Based on our global reach and our longstanding commitment to and experience in the publication paper segment, we believe we are a preferred supplier in Australasia and Europe.
Diversified revenue base with strong

<<<

 visibility
We benefit from significant revenue diversification across geographies, paper grades and customers. We also benefit from long-term relationships with customers and high client retention rates. We believe that our customer base, which

<<<

 includes large top tier publishing groups with strong balance sheets, recognizes the importance of having a sustainable and reliable source of publication paper. This dynamic provides us with considerable recurring business and revenue visibility

<<<

.
In Europe, we have long-standing and stable relationships with many of our customers, including relationships with most of our customers for more than five years and relationships with many customers for between 10 and 20 years. We believe

<<<

 that the creditworthiness of our customer base is validated by our ability to enter into significant factoring facilities in Norway, France and Austria. Our European customer contracts generally provide for quarterly adjustments of pricing

<<<

.
In Australasia, we recently completed the conversion of one paper machine at our Boyer mill in Tasmania to enable the production of coated mechanical paper. This conversion has enabled us to diversify our regional product mix from newsprint

<<<

. We are the sole local producer of newsprint and have integrated extensively with our customers' businesses, including, for example, through warehouse and inventory management, integrated supply chain processes, local support and other logistics

<<<

 services. We have long-term contracts with our two largest customers maturing in 2020, which provide us with strong revenue visibility. In addition, we are well-integrated within our customers' value chain due to our provision of warehousing

<<<

 services for newsprint customers and other logistical services. We believe that this integration provides value-added services that make us a strong preferred supplier.
Efficient cost position
The combination of our cost competitive assets

<<<

, the strategic location of our mills and a stable supply of energy and raw materials provides us with an efficient cost position.
Economies of scale
We benefit from economies of scale in Europe, where the scale of our Saugbrugs, Skogn and Golbey

<<<

 mills enables us to have low production costs per ton. Our mills are well-positioned to reflect demand for the high value types of paper they produce. Our mix of newsprint and magazine production capabilities within our mills provides us with

<<<

 considerable operational synergies and flexibility. In addition, we have a long-standing continuous cost improvement program and have successfully reduced a number of our operating costs, streamlined our production processes and increased the

<<<

 efficiency of our mills.
4

Efficient product distribution
The favorable location of our mills enables us to achieve low delivered costs in our markets. In Europe, our mills are located adjacent to waterways or seaports and benefit from lower

<<<

 transportation costs of both inbound raw materials and outbound distribution of our finished products. In Australasia, we are the sole domestic newsprint and magazine paper producer, which provides us with a significant cost advantage over

<<<

 imports, and our mills are located in close proximity to the populated areas in the region.
Stable supply sourcing
Our long-term contracts for energy and favorable sources of wood provide us with stable sources of supply for our most significant

<<<

 energy and raw material requirements. Approximately 85% of our electricity requirements, our single largest expense item, are purchased under long-term contracts. We have long-term contracts in place that cover substantially all of the electricity

<<<

 requirements for our mills in Norway, and a significant portion of the electricity requirements for our other European operations. Our Australian and New Zealand mills likewise have long-term electricity contracts in place, and our Tasman mill

<<<

 also operates a geothermal energy plant that we commissioned in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, we have long-term contracts for supplies of wood to our Australasian operations and we have long-standing relationships with suppliers in

<<<

 Norway, as we are the country's largest buyer of pulp wood. The relative stability provided by our effective supply contracting and our relationships with reliable suppliers permits strong visibility in relation to costs and shields our operations

<<<

 from electricity and fiber cost fluctuations.
Proven track record of operational streamlining and delivery on current initiatives
We have responded to long-term structural decreases in demand with the closure of several of our machines and

<<<

 mills, such as our Union and Follum mills in Norway and our Steti mill in the Czech Republic, between 2006 and 2012. In 2013, we closed one of the two machines at our Tasman mill in New Zealand and one of the two machines at our Walsum mill

<<<

 in Germany. In total, we have reduced production capacity by more than 50% since December 31,2005, from 6.9 million tons to 3.0 million tons as of September 30, 2014. These actions have significantly reduced our cost base. We have also reduced

<<<

 our fixed costs through headcount reductions and have increased our capital efficiency through the disposal of non-core assets, certain less competitive operations and mills outside of our core geographical regions of Europe and Australasia

<<<

. These include two mills in South Korea, two mills in China, one mill in Brazil, one mill in Chile, one mill in the Netherlands and one mill in Thailand.
In response to structural changes in demand and in order to seize a market opportunity

<<<

 within magazine paper, we have also converted production capacity from newsprint to magazine paper. Following a NOK 500 million (60 million) investment, our Boyer mill in Australia now produces coated mechanical paper on one converted machine

<<<

, making it the sole domestic magazine paper producer in Australasia. Our ability to switch production has enabled us to better adapt to changes in demand between different paper products by reducing production capacity for products that have

<<<

 experienced reduced demand, and by increasing production capacity for products with increased demand. In addition, we have invested more than NOK 200 million (25 million) in a TMP plant at our Saugbrugs mill, resulting in significant reduction

<<<

 of energy consumption in our fiber production at that mill, which has also enabled us to expand our product portfolio to new uncoated mechanical segments.
We continue to focus on the implementation of a variety of improvement initiatives and

<<<

 the identification of new sources of efficiency. We achieved total cost reductions of NOK 351 million (45 million) during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Some of our most successful ongoing improvement initiatives include operational

<<<

 and logistical enhancements at our Saugbrugs, Golbey and Albury mills as a result of reduced usage of chemicals and improved energy balance.
Attractive free cash flow generation
Over the past four years, we have continued to maintain strong

<<<

 cash flows prior to reflecting our debt service payments despite industry revenue declines. We have been able to bolster our cash flow generation by reducing our fixed cost base, improving our management of working capital and selectively selling

<<<

 assets.
Our strong focus on working capital management has resulted in an efficient and industry-leading working capital management system, as reflected by our reduced inventories and improved control of
5

accounts receivable. We have reduced

<<<

 our working capital positions from NOK 2,094 million (270 million) as of December 31, 2011 to NOK 769 million (92 million) as of December 31, 2013.
We believe that we have completed our major development capital expenditures and do not anticipate

<<<

 any substantial development investment programs in the near to medium-term. In recent years, maintenance capital expenditure requirements at our eight mills have remained relatively low and manageable, with capital expenditures of NOK 150 million

<<<

 (20 million) and NOK 151 million (19 million) for the years ended December 31,2012 and 2013, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we spent NOK 112 million (14 million) on maintenance capital expenditures. In addition

<<<

, we have completed various one-time restructuring initiatives that negatively impacted our cash flows in recent years.
The combination of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, efficient management of working capital and the sale of certain

<<<

 assets has contributed to our strong free cash flow generation. In particular, cash conversion, which is defined as EBITDA less changes in working capital and gross capital expenditures divided by EBITDA, was 44%, 98% and 58% for the years

<<<

 ended December 31,2011,2012 and 2013, respectively, and 80% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. Furthermore, we believe the completion of our development capital expenditures and one-time restructuring programs will position us

<<<

 to benefit from attractive cash flow conversion going forward. Excluding development capital expenditures, such as investments in our Boyer and Tasman mills, our cash conversion for the years ended December 31,2011,2012 and 2013 would have

<<<

 been 52%, 120% and 103%, respectively, and 102% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
Strong collateral
The Senior Secured Notes will benefit from robust credit support, which will include senior Guarantees from our primary subsidiaries

<<<

 (the Subsidiary Guarantors), the parent companies of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the Parent Guarantors) and Security Interests (as defined below) over our principal revenue generating assets or security over the shares in the entities

<<<

 that own such revenue generating assets. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Guarantors generated 108% of the Group's consolidated EBITDA, and as of December 31, 2014, held 89% of the Group's total assets, defined as total assets from

<<<

 all Group entities minus intercompany receivables and intercompany shares. Senior Secured Noteholders will receive share pledges over the issued share capital of each of Norske Treindustrier AS, the Exchange Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors, Norske Skog Walsum GmbH and Lysaker Invest AS. In addition, subject to the exclusion of certain assets and subject to certain prior-ranking security interests in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles

<<<

 (as defined below), the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by Security Interests to be granted under a general security deed (the equivalent of a fixed and floating charge) over the assets held by Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited

<<<

, Norske Skog (Australasia) Pty Limited and Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited (together, the ``Australian Guarantors'') and Norske Skog Tasman Limited (the ``New Zealand Guarantor'') which, for the nine months ended September 30, 

<<<

2014, generated 33.1% of the Group's consolidated EBITDA, and as of September 30, 2014, held 34.3% of the Group's total assets. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by all intercompany loans and receivables (excluding receivables

<<<

 relating to the Parent's cash pooling arrangements) owed to the Parent Guarantors, Norske Skog Shared Services AS, Lysaker AS, Norske Skog Eiendom AS, Norske Skog Kraft AS, nsiFocus AS, Wood and Logistics AS, Norske Skog Walsum GmbH, Norske

<<<

 Skog Holdings AG and Norske Skog Property AS, Norske Skog Overseas Holdings AS and NS Industries Canada Ltd. (together, without the Parent Guarantors, each an ``Excluded Entity'') by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the restricted

<<<

 subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.
Execution-focused management team with relevant experience
We believe that our senior management team has the relevant experience to execute our strategy. Each of our regional management teams

<<<

 has an average tenure of 15 years at the Parent. We believe that we benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our senior corporate management team and the production know-how of the respective mill management teams, who have relevant

<<<

 experience in the global publication paper industry. In addition to experience in the publication paper industry globally, our corporate management team also has management experience from other commodities businesses. We maintain a flat and

<<<

 lean decentralized decision-making structure, which allows our local management teams to manage their day-to-day operations based on local market dynamics.
6

Strategy
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Defend our leading position

<<<

 in the publication paper industry in Europe and Australasia
With a leading position in both newsprint and magazine paper in Europe and Australasia, we are well-positioned to leverage our existing customer relationships. We believe we are a

<<<

 stable supplier of newsprint in Europe where we sell our products to some of the region's leading paper consumers, including financial printing operations, drop advertisement producers such as Bertelsmann Group (MOHN Media Mohndruck GmbH),

<<<

 Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG and Carrefour Procurement International and major news publishers such as News International Ltd. in the United Kingdom, RCS Media Group SpA in Italy, Axel Springer SE in Germany and Schibsted Trykk Oslo AS in Norway

<<<

. We are the sole producer of publication paper in Australia and New Zealand and we are working to diversify our revenues. We aim to be the producer of choice for quality newsprint and magazine paper products in the European and Australasian

<<<

 markets, while maintaining and improving our position as a high-quality producer with a competitive cost base.
Continue proactive capacity management
We will continue to manage our production capacity in order to adjust to market developments

<<<

 proactively. In Europe, we have strategically reduced or converted capacity over the past three years, including, for example, our Follum and Parenco operations, to increase the operating margins of our continuing business. We will continue

<<<

 to monitor our asset base and market developments and consider measures to address our less competitive capacity. In Australasia, in line with the closure of one machine at our Tasman mill in 2013 and the conversion of one of our two newsprint

<<<

 machines at the Boyer mill in Australia to magazine paper production in 2014, we will continue our business system optimization in order to produce products where it is most cost-effective to do so.
Continue to strengthen business model
We

<<<

 will continue to invest in improvements to reduce costs and improve efficiency and quality. In Europe, we plan to invest in higher quality grades of newsprint products and focus on the extension of our product portfolio into selected new end

<<<

 use segments within publication paper as well as improve production mix quality at our Skogn mill. In Australasia, we are benefiting from our recent diversification to magazine paper production and we will leverage our new cost competitive

<<<

 position in magazine paper and our well-developed logistical system to serve export markets for newsprint.
Address capital structure and achieve stability
We intend to use the proceeds from the Offering to address a portion of our immediate

<<<

 and medium-term debt maturities through the implementation of the Proposed Exchange Offers. We will strive to reduce leverage in the medium-term to achieve a long-term sustainable capital structure. By reducing the amount of operational earnings

<<<

 committed to debt repayment obligations, we hope to achieve greater operational stability that will provide a basis for future sustained profitability.
Carefully evaluate future consolidation opportunities
We believe our industry needs to continue

<<<

 to better align capacity with demand, which we anticipate will be realized by industry consolidation in Europe. We will continue to evaluate selective opportunities to enhance our strategic and cost positions. However, any potential transaction

<<<

 will be structured with a focus on credit enhancement via careful evaluation of appropriate financing sources and terms.

Developments During the Quarter
There were several developments that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2014 that are expected to impact the Group's businesses and gross operating earnings positively in 2015.
The prolonged ramp-up of the

<<<

 new magazine paper machine at Boyer in Australia was completed. During full year 2014, the ramp-up had a significant negative impact on gross operating earnings. With operations now running in accordance with the investment plan, and assuming

<<<

 this will continue, the new magazine paper machine at Boyer should contribute significantly towards gross operating earnings for full year 2015.
Foreign exchange rates moved in favor of the Group's operations as NOK depreciated against the

<<<

 Group's major currencies due to NOK correlation with lower oil prices. Since only a low single digit percentage of the Group's revenue is generated in NOK, and in excess of a third of the Group's total capacity is located in Norway, the competitiveness

<<<

 of the European business should be clearly enhanced by the NOK depreciation. Likewise, the depreciation of AUD relative to USD should impact the Australasian business positively, supporting the domestic price for magazine paper and the margins

<<<

 for exports to Asia.
The lower oil price is also a direct positive for the Group, given the energy intensity in production of paper from virgin fiber. The positive effect is somewhat mitigated by the Group's long-term energy contracts. However

<<<

, the low oil price could possibly in addition bring indirect positive effects on other input factors, such as chemicals, which to a large degree are oil derivatives.
A number of substantial capacity closures in the publication paper industry

<<<

 were announced in the quarter. Price support is thus expected into the second half of 2015, when the announced closures are completed and the paper is no longer in the market.
We repaid the remaining NOK 185 million (22 million) principal amount

<<<

 of our Norwegian 5.40% Senior Notes due 2014 on October 24, 2014.
Fourth Quarter 2014
The developments described above had limited impact on the Group's fourth quarter of 2014 operating results due to lag effects. Preliminary year-end reporting

<<<

 based on internal management accounts indicate revenue of somewhat above NOK 3 billion and gross operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 broadly in-line with the third quarter of 2014 at approximately NOK 200 million. The effects

<<<

 of portfolio changes, and a reduction in provision for environmental obligations in the fourth quarter of 2013, limit the meaningfulness of a year over year comparison.
Publication Paper Europe
Revenue and volumes were relatively stable from

<<<

 the third quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2014. The weakness in Magazine Paper continued because of low industry operating rates with capacity reductions announced, but not yet completed in the quarter. Magazine Paper thus adversely

<<<

 impacted gross operating earnings, while Newsprint was more stable with a higher operating rate in the industry prior to the announced closures. The depreciation of NOK to a large degree occurred late in the quarter, and thus did not have a

<<<

 meaningful impact on the fourth quarter 2014 operating result.
Publication Paper Australasia
Revenue and volumes increased seasonally from the third quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2014 and the ramp-up at Boyer was completed. Both

<<<

 these factors contributed towards improved gross operating earnings in the quarter as compared to the prior quarter. The depreciation of AUD against USD benefited price negotiations for Magazine Paper into 2015. The exchange rate level should

<<<

 also support margins for the export business out of Australasia into Asia.
Other Activities
The negative contribution from Other Activities was larger in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2014, due to year end closing

<<<

 of cost allocations.
8

Cash Flow
Cash flow from operations benefited from a seasonal release of working capital, more than offsetting interest payments in the quarter. Capital expenditures were somewhat higher than in the third quarter of

<<<

 2014, reflecting volatility in investment spending. The redemptions of the remaining NOK bond in October was in part financed by proceeds from accounts receivables (AR) facilities. The Group's new AR facility, announced in September 2014 at

<<<

 Bruck in Austria, became effective in the quarter.
Balance Sheet
Considering the above cash flow movements, cash balances were somewhat higher at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the end of the third quarter of 2014. Cash balances

<<<

 include restricted cash of approximately NOK 250 million. A liquidity buffer of around NOK 200 million is prudent to allow for daily volatility in working capital. Foreign denominated debt, when translated to NOK for accounting purposes, increased

<<<

 due to the depreciation of NOK from the end of the third quarter of 2014 to the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Property, plant and equipment also increased due to NOK depreciation, while there will be a negative effect from Euro-denominated

<<<

 power contracts in Norway.

Prior to February 15, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Secured Notes at a

17

redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest

<<<

, if any, plus the applicable ``make-whole'' premium.

At any time prior to February 15, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, using

<<<

 the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 111.75% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption; provided

<<<

 that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding after the redemption. See ``Description of the Senior Secured Notes-- Optional Redemption.''

Additional Amounts; Tax Redem ption....................................

All payments in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for any taxes or other governmental

<<<

 charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding or deduction is required by law, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or other payor, as applicable, will pay additional amounts so that the net amount

<<<

 you receive is no less than that which you would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction. See ``Description of the Senior Secured Notes-- Additional Amounts'' and ``Description of the Exchange Notes--Additional Amounts

<<<

" . The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, if certain changes in tax law impose certain withholding taxes on amounts payable on the Notes, and, as a result, the Issuer or a Guarantor

<<<

 is required to pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding taxes. If the Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it must pay you a price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus interest and additional amounts,

<<<

 if any, to the date of redemption. See ``Description of the Senior Secured Notes-- Optional Redemption-- Redemption for Changes in Taxes" .

Change of Control.............................

If the Parent experiences a change of control, the

<<<

 Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amounts plus accrued interest to the date of such repurchase. See ``Description of the Senior Secured Notes-- Repurchase at the Option of Holders-- Change of

SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA The following tables present our summary consolidated

<<<

 historical financial information and other data as of and for the periods indicated. This information has been derived from our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and from our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which

<<<

 are included elsewhere in these listing particulars. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer was registered under the Norwegian Companies Registry on November 18, 2014 and the Exchange Notes Issuer was registered under the Norwegian Companies Registry

<<<

 on November 5, 2014. There is no financial information regarding either the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Exchange Notes Issuer presented in these listing particulars. Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain

<<<

 all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the nine-month periods

<<<

 are not necessarily indicative of results for a full financial year, or any other periods. Our summary unaudited consolidated statement of income data for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 has been derived by adding our historical

<<<

 consolidated statement of income data for the financial year ended December 31,2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and subtracting our historical consolidated statement of income data for the nine months ended September 30, 2

<<<

013. Our unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information as at and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 provides certain information on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions, including the issuance of the Notes

<<<

 and the assumed application of the net proceeds in the Proposed Exchange Offers. Our unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information presented herein has been prepared for informational purposes only, and does not purport to represent

<<<

 what our actual financial position or consolidated interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on (i) September 30, 2014, for the purposes of the calculation of pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities and pro forma secured

<<<

 net interest-bearing liabilities and (ii) October 1,2013, for the purposes of the calculation of pro forma net finance costs, nor does it purport to represent our consolidated interest expense or actual financial position at any future date

(4) EBITDA, for any relevant period, represents net profit/(loss) for the period before income

 affecting our business than IFRS results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. You should not consider EBITDA

 in isolation or as a substitute for profit for the year or operating earnings as determined by IFRS, or as a substitute for an analysis of our Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in the sections entitled ``Presentation of Financial

 and Other Information", ``Summary" and this ``Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data" of these listing particulars, we use the term " EBITDA" in lieu of the term gross operating earnings due to the familiarity of the term EBITDA to prospective

Publication Paper Operational Data from Continuing Operations
One of the principal factors affecting our financial results and their comparability across periods is the disposal of businesses. Since January 1,2011, we have made five

<<<

 disposals of operational and closed mills and our recovered paper operations. As illustrated by the table and discussion under the section ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations

<<<

" , the comparability of our revenues and EBITDA over the periods indicated were significantly impacted by these disposals, which negatively impacted our Group's consolidated operating revenues and EBITDA.
Constant Perimeter Financial Information

<<<


Below we present our Constant Perimeter Financial Information which includes the historical operating and financial results of our existing portfolio of mills, Bruck, Golbey, Skogn, Albury, Boyer, Tasman, Walsum and Saugbrugs. The Constant

<<<

 Perimeter Financial Information has neither been audited nor reviewed by our independent auditors and includes information with respect to the production volumes, sales volumes, capacity, operating revenue, EBITDA and capital expenditures of

<<<

 the eight mills we currently operate. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information does not reflect results from our operations recorded as Other Activities in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which would require significant further adjustments

<<<

 and assumptions due to the difficulties in allocating revenues and costs to appropriate assets given the changes to the Group's structure. See ``Presentation of Financial and Other Information-- Constant Perimeter Financial Information" for

<<<

 additional details regarding the presentation of these results and their underlying assumptions. These assumptions are based on our historical unaudited management accounts and financial records, and they involve certain assumptions which were

<<<

 not at the time and have not since been reviewed with our auditors during the periods presented for conformity with IFRS reporting standards other than in conjunction with the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a review

<<<

 of our historical operating results under IFRS, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements included in these listing particulars beginning on page F-1. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information is not intended to represent or to be

<<<

 indicative of the consolidated results of operations our currently operational eight mills would have reported had the disposals of our Pisa, Singburi, Bio Bio, Follum, Parenco and Reparco operations occurred on January 1,2011 and has not been

<<<

 adjusted to reflect any additional costs or revenues that might have resulted therefrom. Some of the factors that could have caused our financial performance to differ materially from that expressed or implied by the Constant Perimeter Financial

<<<

 Information had such disposals occurred on January 1, 2011 include increased expenses (including the need to incur additional materials or staff-related or other costs) due to increased production at our remaining mills during the historical

<<<

 period with an uncertain impact on our operating margin. Use of this financial data may, therefore, give an inaccurate reflection of what our current portfolio's operational results would have been had such disposals occurred on January 1,

<<<

 2011. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information is designed to aid comparability of our results across reporting periods. The purpose of such information is to illustrate the historical results of our current portfolio of operational mills

<<<

 as of September 30, 2014 and for the periods indicated. In particular, the table indicates the revenue decreases across our mill operations in each of the periods under review, even after having removed the negative impact of the disposals

<<<

. The analysis further indicates that operating EBITDA for our current portfolio of mills decreased in each of 2011,2012 and 2013 and has increased year-over-year with respect to both the twelve months and nine months ended September 30, 20

RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information contained in these listing particulars, you should carefully consider the following

<<<

 risk factors in evaluating an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees. Any of the risks described below, or additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a significant or material adverse effect

<<<

 on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and result in a corresponding decline in the market price of the Notes. You could lose all or a substantial part of your investment.
These listing particulars also contain

<<<

 forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere

<<<

 in these listing particulars. See "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements''.
Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry
We have a history of losses, and we may not be profitable or generate sufficient cash flow to meet our liquidity

<<<

 needs in the future.
We have had a history of losses. For the years ended December 31,2013, 2012 and 2011, we generated net losses of NOK 1,844 million, NOK 2,781 million and NOK 2,545 million, respectively. In addition, in recent periods,

<<<

 our operating cash flows and available capital resources have not been sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. For the year ended December 31,2013 and the nine months

<<<

 ended September 30, 2014, our net cash flow from operating activities was NOK 68 million and NOK (224) million, respectively. A failure to become profitable or to generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our liquidity needs could adversely

<<<

 affect our ability to sustain operations, obtain additional funding, meet our debt service obligations, including with respect to the Notes, or continue as a going concern.
During recent years, we experienced weaker demand for our products

<<<

 due to depressed economic conditions, decreased circulation levels of newspapers and magazines and other trends in end-user preferences, which adversely impacted our results of operations and liquidity. Our future liquidity could be negatively

<<<

 impacted by many factors including, but not limited to, continued overcapacity in the paper industry, decreased prices for our finished products, reduced demand for publication paper, increased prices for raw materials, exchange rate fluctuations

<<<

 or other factors. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital

<<<

 expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional financing, restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, including the Notes, or forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses.
The availability

<<<

, timing and terms of any alternative sources of liquidity will likely depend upon our financial condition and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that any future financing will be available to us at any given

<<<

 time or as to the reasonableness of the terms on which any future financing may be available. We cannot assure you that our current expectations of cash flow from operations (which will depend on numerous future factors and conditions, many

<<<

 of which are beyond our control) will be accurate. Such cash flow projections are merely estimates of future events and actual events will probably vary from current estimates, possibly materially.
The publication paper industry has undergone

<<<

 significant fundamental changes in the last decade. This has resulted in periods of substantial overcapacity and intense competition among paper manufacturers, principally associated with declining demand in certain markets for publication

<<<

 paper, especially newsprint, which is likely to continue.
Demand for our products is influenced by global economic trends, demographic trends, circulation levels of newspapers and magazines, technological developments, trends in end-user preferences

<<<

 and inventory levels maintained by our customers.
The rise of the internet and other electronic media, including as a replacement for print-based advertising, has fundamentally changed the market environment for our products and has resulted

<<<

 in a decline in demand in certain markets for publication paper. The decrease in demand for publication paper is structural, rather than cyclical, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. In particular, levels of demand for newsprint

<<<

 in certain historically significant markets, such as Europe, Australasia
27

and the United States, have declined and are likely to continue to decline. Newspaper and magazine publishers have developed electronic platforms and channels as

<<<

 supplements to their printed versions and significant advertising volumes have moved from printed to electronic media. These trends have had, and are likely to continue to have in the years to come, an adverse effect on the circulation levels

<<<

 of traditional print media and consequently on consumption of publication paper.
In the 1990s, we and many of our competitors made significant investments in Europe to increase production capacity. In the last decade, large amounts of new capacity

<<<

 have been built in Asia, especially in China, to cover the expected demand growth in that region. This has reduced the need for imports from North America and Europe. In the same period, the demand for newsprint has declined significantly in

<<<

 North America, and to some extent in Europe, due to the reasons mentioned above, which has led to excess capacity in both these regions.
Imbalance between production capacity and demand remains our and the industry's largest challenge, as this

<<<

 imbalance has contributed to significant downward pressure on selling prices for our products. While we are a significant participant in most of the markets in which we compete, neither our actions nor those of any one industry participant

<<<

 have more than a small influence on changes in product prices. According to PPPC, in 2013 global declines in capacity matched or exceeded the declines in global demand. Despite recent industry-wide efforts to consolidate, however, overcapacity

<<<

 is likely to continue to have an effect in the future. Any decline in demand and corresponding excess capacity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have a substantial amount of

<<<

 indebtedness maturing in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and we may not have adequate liquidity to satisfy our debt obligations as they become due.
As of September 30, 2014, without giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we had total interest bearing

<<<

 liabilities of NOK 7,604 billion, including U.S.$158.2 million (NOK 1,021 million) of 2015 Notes, 129.6 million (NOK 1,052 million) of 2016 Notes and 388.5 million (NOK 3,154 million) of 2017 Notes. While we intend to use the proceeds of this

<<<

 Offering to address our near to medium-term maturities, we do not expect that the proceeds of this Offering, together with our anticipated cash flow from operations and other capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations

<<<

 as they become due in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Our ability to satisfy these obligations will depend, in part, on the successful completion of the Proposed Exchange Offers and the Proposed Consent Solicitations, or one or more alternative transactions

<<<

. The completion of this Offering is not contingent upon the completion of the Proposed Exchange Offers or the Proposed Consent Solicitations or any other transaction; however, if we do not receive the requisite consents for each series of the

<<<

 Parent's Existing Notes in the Proposed Consent Solicitations, or if sufficient consents are received for all series of Existing Notes but less than holders of a majority in principal amount of each series of Existing Notes tenders their Existing

<<<

 Notes in the Proposed Exchange Offers (unless the requirement for a majority in principal amount to exchange is waived by Norske Skog AS), the maximum amount of Senior Secured Notes to be issued in the Exchange for Temporary Notes will be 

<<<

179.0 million.
There is no minimum tender condition for any series of Existing Notes in the Proposed Exchange Offers. If the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations are not completed, we intend to use the proceeds from this

<<<

 Offering to address a portion of the maturities of the Parent's Existing Notes in one or more alternative transactions. There can be no assurance that the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations will be completed, or as

<<<

 to the aggregate principal amount of each series of Existing Notes that will be exchanged for Exchange Notes.
While this Offering and the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations (if completed) may extend the maturities of

<<<

 a significant portion of our indebtedness, such transactions may also result in significantly higher interest costs. Moreover, even after the completion of the Proposed Exchange Offers, we may still have significant debt repayment obligations

<<<

 due in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
The Indenture governing the Notes and the indenture that will govern the Exchange Notes will impose significant limitations on our ability to refinance any of the unsecured debt securities that remain outstanding

<<<

, including with respect to the grant of guarantees or security for any refinancing debt. In addition, if we do not have adequate liquidity to satisfy our debt obligations as they become due, there is an increased risk that the Guarantees and

<<<

 the Security Interests granted in favor of the Senior Secured Noteholders will be subject to claims that they should be limited, subordinated or set aside. See ``--Fraudulent conveyance laws and other limitations on the enforceability and the

<<<

 amount of the Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely affect their validity and enforceability" .
28

Even if we successfully consummate the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations or an alternative liability

<<<

 management transaction, our remaining indebtedness may impair our financial condition and our ability to grow and compete, and we may incur additional debt.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2014, without giving

<<<

 pro forma effect to the Transactions, we had total interest-bearing liabilities of NOK 7,604 billion. Our high leverage has important consequences for our financial condition, including:
 requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from

<<<

 operations for the payment of principal and interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, the execution of our business strategy, acquisitions, operations and general corporate

<<<

 requirements;
 making it more difficult to refinance our obligations as they come due;
 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, competitive and industry conditions;
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to

<<<

 fund future working capital, capital expenditures, the execution of our business strategy, acquisitions, operations and other general corporate requirements;
 limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make divestitures

<<<

;
 limiting our ability to retain key employees or attract new employees;
 limiting our ability to retain and attract customers;
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which

<<<

 we operate; and
 limiting our ability to receive trade credit from our suppliers or otherwise placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other less-leveraged competitors.
The indenture and fiscal agency agreements governing the Parent's Existing

<<<

 Notes contain, and the indentures governing the Notes and the Exchange Notes will contain, certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with

<<<

 those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could cause an acceleration of all of our debts.
We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future pursuant to the

<<<

 terms of the instruments governing our debt securities. If new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could intensify.
We will require a significant amount of cash

<<<

 to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, fund working capital and make planned capital expenditures.
Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, and to fund working capital and planned capital

<<<

 expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future and our ability to borrow under our other lending facilities, to the extent of available borrowings. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial

<<<

, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If adverse regional and national economic conditions persist, worsen or fail to improve significantly, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations

<<<

 attributable to decreases in wholesale and consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations that we are subject to under our

<<<

 indebtedness.
If our future cash flows and other capital resources (including availability under our factoring and securitization facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced

<<<

 to:
 reduce or delay our capital expenditures;
 close or curtail operations at our mills and further reduce our sales and overhead staffs;
 dispose of assets;
 obtain additional debt or equity capital; or
 refinance all or a portion of

<<<

 our debt.
29

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us, or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund

<<<

 our other liquidity needs. Any failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to access alternative sources of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The demand for our products

<<<

 is affected by cyclical factors.
Much of the demand for our products is generated directly or indirectly by advertising, whether by newsprint publishers, printers, direct mail campaigns, magazine publishers or other ultimate end-users of paper

<<<

. When the economy slows, advertising and promotional expenditures are generally reduced and our customers' demand for our products declines. These factors are beyond our control and we are therefore vulnerable to declines in economic conditions

<<<

, such as during the recent global economic downturn.
Prices for our finished products may fluctuate significantly.
The markets for publication paper products such as newsprint and magazine paper are highly cyclical and have historically experienced

<<<

 significant price volatility. Because publication paper is a commodity-like product, there are generally few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer. This has resulted in strong price competition for our products, with price determined

<<<

 by supply relative to demand. Levels of supply and demand may differ between products and geographic regions.
Supply of publication paper is principally affected by production and capacity levels. In recent years, there has been significant

<<<

 excess capacity in the market, which resulted from fundamental changes that have taken place in our industry. In response to this, in common with other industry participants, we have reduced industry capacity through the idling and closure

<<<

 of paper machines and mills. However, to avoid the idling or closing of mills, some producers may choose to continue to operate at a loss for a period of time, which could prolong weak pricing environments due to over-supply in the industry

<<<

 as a whole. Therefore, despite capacity reductions, there is a risk that supply will continue to exceed demand, which may cause prices to fall and change the pattern of imports and exports between regions. Excess capacity can exacerbate price

<<<

 decreases in periods of declining demand and can delay price increases that would otherwise result from any future increase in demand.
Demand for publication paper fluctuates and is affected by general economic conditions and increased use

<<<

 of the internet and other electronic media, each of which impact end-user demand for publication paper as described above. In light of the potential for further structural decline in demand resulting from, for example, ever greater usage of

<<<

 the internet to deliver media content, we may not be able to increase or even maintain current price levels for our products.
Like other paper companies, we have limited influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products

<<<

, which are influenced by many factors outside our control and can often be volatile. In addition, despite our cost control initiatives, fixed costs continue to comprise a significant proportion of our cost structure. Therefore, we have only

<<<

 very limited scope to further reduce our fixed costs in response to downward pressure on selling prices for our products. Any further significant downturn in the price levels for our products would have a material adverse effect on our business

<<<

, results of operations and financial condition.
Prices for our raw materials are volatile and there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain our raw materials, in particular energy, wood and recovered paper, at prices that will enable

<<<

 us to sell our products profitably, or at all.
The main raw materials used by us in the production of our products are energy, wood and recovered paper, which accounted for 21%, 13% and 9%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for

<<<

 the year ended December 31,2013. Since 2011, our results of operations have been negatively affected by an increase in the costs (on the basis of costs per ton of publication paper) for each of these inputs.
Our global manufacturing operations

<<<

 utilize electricity, geothermal energy, natural gas and the burning of waste wood for which we generally rely on third-party suppliers. As a result, we are susceptible to price volatility, in particular in energy and recovered paper prices

<<<

. In addition, we may from time to time be subject to unpredictable supplies of our raw materials, and no assurance can be given that we would be able to source alternative supplies of raw materials in a timely or cost-effective manner or at

<<<

 all. In the year ended December 31,2013, purchased electricity accounted for 53% of our energy expenses. Our
30

contracts with energy suppliers can vary as to price, quantity and duration. Our energy costs are also affected by various market

<<<

 factors, including supply and demand balance, fuel prices and local and national regulatory decisions.
While we have long-term contracts in place for a portion of our wood needs, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient supplies

<<<

 of wood, recovered paper or other raw materials for all of our production needs, or that prices will remain at levels that will enable us to sell our finished products profitably, or at all.
Unlike many of our competitors, we are not vertically

<<<

 integrated. Our competitors that have greater degrees of vertical integration may have more secure access to, and better control of the cost of, raw materials. Producers with a greater degree of vertical integration may therefore have a competitive

<<<

 advantage over us. This is particularly significant in our magazine segment, as the manufacturing process is primarily based on the use of wood fiber and chemical pulp, each of which is particularly susceptible to significant price volatility

<<<

.
The price for our products is determined primarily based on demand and we may therefore be unable, in the short term or at all, to pass on to our customers any increases in the cost of our raw materials. Any sustained increase in the cost

<<<

 of energy, wood or recovered paper prices would reduce our gross profit margins, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Industry consolidation in Europe constitutes a key element

<<<

 of our business strategy. Failure to consummate consolidation transactions or to implement any of our business strategies successfully or unexpected developments in the publication paper industry could materially adversely affect our business

<<<

 and results of operations.
We may be unable to implement our strategies or achieve the anticipated results of such strategies. Our strategies are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many

<<<

 of which are beyond our control. In particular, we believe industry consolidation in Europe is necessary in order to better align capacity with demand and we are actively seeking to achieve this through acquisitions, alliances and/or strategic

<<<

 partnerships with other industry participants. The success of this strategy depends on numerous factors, such as the participation of our competitors in such industry consolidation, our financial resources and those of our competitors, our

<<<

 ability to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms, our ability to successfully evaluate and consummate any such consolidation transactions, the impact on our financial condition of any additional debt incurred in connection with any

<<<

 such consolidation transactions and the realization of the expected benefits of any such consolidation transactions when expected or to the extent anticipated. In addition, our strategy has been developed based on our predictions and assumptions

<<<

 as to future developments in the publication paper industry, which judgments are based on the experience of our management team. If we are unable to implement our key business strategies, or if the publication paper industry develops in a manner

<<<

 that we have not anticipated, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may not recognize the expected benefits of planned or completed investments or operational changes.
As part

<<<

 of our ongoing operations, we regularly invest in new operations or adopt new operating policies intended to reduce costs or increase operating margins; however, there can be no assurance that such investments or operations will generate such

<<<

 intended benefits. For example, in 2012 we completed the construction of a geothermal power plant at our Tasman mill in New Zealand with the intention of reducing the cost of electricity for the site's operations and selling excess energy in

<<<

 local markets. As a result of declines in the cost of energy in New Zealand in 2012 and 2013, the spot price of electricity fell below those expected when the investment in the geothermal plant was approved and subsequent sales of excess energy

<<<

 from the geothermal plant's operations have been below initially budgeted expectations. Similarly, in the first quarter of 2014, we completed the conversion of one of our Boyer mill's two newsprint machines to magazine paper production. During

<<<

 the first half of 2014, the converted magazine paper machine did not reach the intended productivity levels expected under the project's anticipated timeline. Any future investments in capital expenditures, entry into joint ventures and/or

<<<

 adoption of new operating procedures may not generate the intended benefits and the failure to realize such benefits may have a material negative effect on the results of our operations.
31

Our business and results of operations are affected

<<<

 by many general economic factors.
Our business and results of operations are affected by many general economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. We are particularly vulnerable to economic

<<<

 conditions in Europe as our European segment operations represented 75.2% of our operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Despite our higher EBITDA during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (which included the opening

<<<

 of our first magazine paper operations at our Boyer mill in Australia) as compared to the same period in 2013, if economic conditions in the markets in which we operate worsen, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially

<<<

 adversely affected in 2015 and beyond.
The markets for publication paper products are highly competitive, and some of our competitors have advantages that may adversely affect our ability to compete with them.
We compete against a large number

<<<

 of publication paper producers located around the world. Some of these companies benefit from vertical integration, product diversity, greater financial resources or economies of scale, or operate mills that are lower-cost producers of paper

<<<

 products than our mills, making them less vulnerable to adverse fluctuations in any one sector than we are. Furthermore, our competitors may be better positioned financially or operationally than we are to take advantage of consolidation opportunities

<<<

 which may arise, and there can be no assurances that a failure to take advantage of such opportunities on our behalf would not make us less competitive.
In order to remain competitive, we must also respond to changes in consumer preferences

<<<

. For example, paper companies have historically responded to changes in consumer preferences by improving existing or developing new paper qualities, such as paper with increased recovered paper content, increased brightness or lower basis

<<<

 weight, and by increasing production of higher margin light-weight coated and super-calendared magazine paper. A failure to respond to such changes in consumer preferences could cause us to become less competitive.
Increased competition could

<<<

 result in a loss of market share, increased expenditures or reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, competitive market conditions may result in an inability to increase the

<<<

 selling prices of our products sufficiently or in time to offset the effects of increased costs without losing market share and aggressive pricing by competitors may force us to decrease prices in an attempt to maintain market share. In addition

<<<

, our competitors may have a greater ability to reduce the price of their products, whether as a result of lower costs of production, greater economies of scale, greater financial resources or otherwise, which would further affect our ability

<<<

 to compete. Our business is concentrated in certain geographic regions and along product lines. Changes that would affect our key markets and/or products may have a disproportionate impact on our business relative to competitors that are more

<<<

 vertically-integrated and have greater geographic and product diversification.
An inability to remain competitive could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our manufacturing operations

<<<

 are subject to operational risks.
The production of paper involves a significant degree of uncertainty and risk, both in terms of operational performance and costs. The effect of this degree of uncertainty and risk on our operations can be

<<<

 difficult to predict and is often influenced by factors outside our control. Our operations are subject to hazards and risks normally associated with industrial activity and exploitation of natural resources, such as:
 scarcity of natural

<<<

 resources required for production, such as wood and water;
 environmental hazards, including the discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals;
 requirements as to environmental remediation and the costs associated with decommissioning of

<<<

 machines or mills that we temporarily idle or permanently close;
 industrial accidents, electricity stoppages and equipment or asset failures;
 labor disputes;
 difficulty or delays in obtaining necessary permits and authorizations (e.g

<<<

. environmental, land use and fire safety permits); and
32

 seismic activity and the impact of natural disasters, including earthquakes, droughts, floods and/or extreme weather conditions which may prevent access to our cold-weather ports

<<<

.
The occurrence of such events may result in the death of, or personal injury to, mill workers, the loss of production equipment, damage to production facilities, the closure of mills, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations

<<<

 in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs and potential legal liabilities. For example, in February 2011, a fire at the pulp production system supplying our Saugbrugs mill in Norway caused extensive

<<<

 damage to the electrical cable system, forcing us to stop all operations of three paper machines, delaying the return to normal production levels until January 2012. The occurrence of such events in the future could have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
We are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations, which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to incur significant liabilities

<<<

.
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. We are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing

<<<

, among other things, water use, air emissions, wood procurement, use of recycled materials, energy sources, the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the operation of our mills (including the noise

<<<

 impact of our operations), the protection of the environment, wildlife and natural resources and the remediation of environmental contamination. Our operations require us to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental

<<<

 permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenge. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability

<<<

 to continue our operations.
The risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in industrial operations, including the publication paper industry. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or

<<<

 permit requirements may result in civil or criminal fines, penalties or enforcement actions. These may include regulatory or judicial orders curtailing our operations or requiring corrective or remedial measures, such as the installation of

<<<

 pollution control equipment, any of which could require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to incur significant liabilities or curtail certain of our manufacturing operations.
Further, the adoption of increasingly strict environmental

<<<

 laws, regulations and enforcement policies, particularly those relating to air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, has resulted in the past, and could

<<<

 result in the future, in substantially increased compliance costs and liabilities. For example, if laws are introduced that require us to change, or impose other requirements in relation to, the sources of energy we currently use, it may result

<<<

 in a material increase in our operating expenses and require us to make significant capital expenditures aimed at ensuring compliance with such laws, regulations and policies. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur significant

<<<

 additional environmental costs and liabilities in relation to businesses or assets we may acquire, including liabilities incurred by such business or assets before we acquire them.
It is difficult to predict the future development of such laws

<<<

 and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or their impact on our future earnings and operations, and such laws and regulations may require capital expenditures to ensure compliance. Increased regulatory, environmental and similar

<<<

 costs and changes to operational requirements could reduce our profit margins and earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in the political or economic conditions

<<<

 in the countries in which we operate, or in which our products are sold, could adversely affect our results of operations and our business decisions.
We manufacture products in various countries in Europe and Australasia and participate in

<<<

 a jointventure in Malaysia. We sell products throughout the world. Our operations can, from time to time, attract heightened political scrutiny, as a result, for example, of the environmental impact of the use of wood to make paper. The economic

<<<

 and political climate of each country has a significant impact on our costs and the prices of, and demand for, our products. We conduct a substantial part of our operations in Europe, particularly in Norway and France, and as such, any adverse

<<<

 developments in those countries in particular or Europe in general, such as increases in tariffs or export duties, increases in tax or permit
33

payments relating to transportation, changes in regulation, scarcity in, or increased prices

<<<

 for, raw materials, a negative political environment or an economic downturn, can affect the cost of manufacturing and distributing our products and can affect the prices of our products and our sales volume. Any of these factors could adversely

<<<

 affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are exposed to credit and liquidity risks with respect to the receipt and timing of payments from our customers and liquidity risks with respect to the payment terms offered

<<<

 by our suppliers.
We finance the acquisition of raw materials and the production and delivery of publication paper from working capital, credit lines or other financing sources. While we have implemented receivables financings in Europe and

<<<

 Australasia, our ability to fund our working capital requirements at any time will depend upon our future operating performance, our ability to generate sufficient cash and the receipt and timing of payments from our customers and the payment

<<<

 terms offered by our suppliers.
We face the risk of non-payment by our customers in connection with the sale of our products, particularly in respect of sales to commercial printers who have been particularly affected by the economic downturn

<<<

 and significant decreases in the demand for commercial printing in recent years. A continued weakness in the general economic environment may result in increased payment defaults by our customers and increased losses. As of December 31,201

<<<

3, we had NOK 1,303 million of accounts receivable, of which NOK 94 million was over three months past due. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we had charges of NOK 90 million, NOK 80 million and NOK 98 million to our provision

<<<

 for bad debts.
Our financial position has been negatively affected by the global economic downturn, which made financing more difficult to obtain for us and for our customers and suppliers. We may experience irregular or insufficient cash flows

<<<

 that may make it difficult for us to meet our obligations to suppliers and customers in a timely manner or at all. Due to liquidity concerns, suppliers may require payments in advance from us on the purchase of certain raw materials. Delayed

<<<

 payment or non-payment by our customers, or requests for payment in advance by our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely impact

<<<

 our financial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to the impact of exchange rates in several ways which are significant to our financial condition and results of operations. We are exposed to transaction risks as a result of

<<<

 differences in the currency mix of our operating revenue, on the one hand, and our operating costs, on the other hand. For example, the majority of the operating revenue from the sales of publication paper from our Norwegian operations is denominated

<<<

 in Euros and UK pounds sterling, while a significant portion of the operating costs for such operations are denominated in Norwegian kroner. These imbalances have negatively impacted the results of such operations and some of our other operations

<<<

 in recent periods as a result of the relative strength of the Norwegian kroner. We hedge some of this risk by contracting for certain expenses in Euros instead of local currencies, in particular for energy costs; however, we have terminated

<<<

 our currency hedging arrangements and there can be no assurance that our existing contractual arrangements will fully protect us from transactional exchange rate risk or that we will be able to enter into future hedging arrangements on commercially

<<<

 reasonable terms.
We are also subject to translation risk because our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Norwegian kroner but only a portion of our revenues, assets and liabilities are located in Norway or denominated in Norwegian

<<<

 kroner. Exchange rate fluctuations could have a significant adverse effect on our income statement and balance sheet when we translate those revenues, assets and liabilities into Norwegian kroner at the exchange rate prevailing on the date

<<<

 of our Consolidated Financial Statements (or, in the case of revenues, at the period average). As of, and for the year ended, December 31,2013, 28.4% of our revenues and 31.7% of our property, plant and equipment were allocated in Norway.
Additionally

<<<

, currency fluctuations influence publication paper prices and trade flows and can also affect the relative competitive position of a paper mill, and there is a risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our competitiveness

<<<

 relative to our competitors in different countries. There can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
34

A downgrade in our debt ratings

<<<

 could result in increased interest and other financial expenses related to future borrowings, and could further restrict our access to additional capital or trade credit.
Standard and Poor's Ratings Services (" S&P" ) and Moody's Investors

<<<

 Service (``Moody's'') maintain credit ratings for us. Each of these ratings is currently below investment grade. On January 22, 2015, S&P downgraded our corporate credit rating and placed it on a negative watch, while Moody's downgraded our

<<<

 Probability of Default Rating (leaving our corporate credit rating unchanged). Any decision by these or other ratings agencies to downgrade such ratings in the future could result in increased interest and other financial expenses relating

<<<

 to our future borrowings, and could restrict our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, any further downgrade could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, trade credit extended by our suppliers

<<<

 of raw materials.
Our Australasian business is dependent on a limited number of customers, the loss of any one of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In Australasia, which contributed

<<<

 24.9% of our operating revenue and 31.8% of our gross operating earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we derive most of our revenues from only a few customers. While we currently have long-term contracts in place with these

<<<

 customers, contracts will fall due for renewal in 2020. If we or the customers do not perform our respective obligations under such contracts, or if we lose any one of these customers without finding alternative sources of demand, our business

<<<

 reputation in the region would be significantly degraded. In such a situation, we may find it difficult to attract new customers or retain those customers with which we currently have relationships. Additionally, both our customers and our

<<<

 suppliers of raw materials may demand more restrictive terms or shorter contract durations in their contracts with our Australasian businesses. Any of these results, singularly or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business

<<<

, financial condition or results of operations.
The value of our energy contracts, and consequently our results of operations, may fluctuate significantly.
We have entered into long-term energy supply contracts in most countries. In the event

<<<

 that the amount of energy we require for our operations in those geographies is less than that contracted for (for example, due to capacity reductions), we may resell the excess energy on the market and we may, from time to time, amend or sell

<<<

 our rights and obligations under such energy contracts. Under IFRS, the entire value of energy contracts that provide for excess supply must be valued at fair value. Contracts for energy that are for our own use do not have to be valued at

<<<

 fair value, but if they include embedded derivatives, the imbedded derivatives must be valued at fair value. Fair value is calculated as the present value of cash flows over the life of the contract. Changes in fair value are recorded as income

<<<

 or expense, as applicable, in our income statement. Since the fair value is based on market expectations for energy prices and currency exchange rates, interest rates, price indices and the discount rate used, additional volatility is introduced

<<<

 in our results. Due to volatility in the market price of energy and certain other relevant parameters, it is impossible to predict what the impact will be on our results of operations or financial condition from quarter to quarter. Accordingly

<<<

, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in the value of our energy contracts will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We depend on third parties for certain transportation services

<<<

.
We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of our products to our customers and transportation of our raw materials to us, in particular by truck and train. If any third-party transportation provider fails to deliver our products

<<<

 in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell them at full value. Similarly, if any transportation provider fails to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis. Shipments of

<<<

 products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions, strikes or other events. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively

<<<

 impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis could be adversely affected by the lack

<<<

 of adequate availability of transportation services, especially rail capacity, whether because of work stoppages or otherwise. Furthermore, increases in the cost of our transportation
35

services, including as a result of rising fuel costs

<<<

, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Rising postal costs could weaken demand for our paper products.
A significant portion of paper is used in magazines, catalogs and other promotional

<<<

 mailings. Many of these materials are distributed through the mail. Future increases in the cost of postage could reduce the frequency of mailings, reduce the number of pages in magazine and advertising materials and/or cause catalogue and

<<<

 magazine publishers to use alternate methods to distribute their materials. Any of the foregoing could decrease the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition

<<<

.
Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain appropriately skilled employees.
Our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain appropriately skilled employees for the operation

<<<

 and development of our business. This challenge is particularly acute as we are operating in a mature and declining industry. Any failure to retain and attract key members of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Labor disputes may cause work stoppages, strikes and disruptions.
We continually evaluate the cost efficiency of our mills, and we may make selective closures of

<<<

 our less efficient mills as part of a reduction in our aggregate capacity serving regions where we anticipate limited future growth. We have in the past implemented, and may again in the future implement, changes and restructuring measures

<<<

, including mill and machine shutdowns, divestitures (such as Norske Skog Korea and Norske Skog Steti in the Czech Republic) and workforce reductions in order to decrease production costs, improve efficiency at our production facilities, exploit

<<<

 synergies and cope with the demands of a changing market. Substantially all of our employees involved in production are members of labor unions, and these measures or other reasons could result in labor disputes, strikes or disruptions which

<<<

 could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Post-retirement plan obligations may affect our financial condition.
We maintain defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement

<<<

 benefit plans for certain retired employees. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our net pension obligations (net unfunded pension plans less net partly or fully funded pension plans) were NOK 692 million and NOK 618 million, respectively. Funding

<<<

 requirements for these plans are dependent on various factors, including interest rates, asset returns, regulatory requirements for funding purposes and changes to plan benefits. In 2014, we are required to contribute approximately NOK 32 million

<<<

 towards the underfunded liability of the defined benefit pension plans. Although we expect to continue to make contributions to fund post-retirement plan obligations and to meet legal funding obligations for the defined benefit pension plan

<<<

, no assurance can be made that the underfunded liability under these plans will not be materially adverse to us in the future.
The availability and cost of insurance cover can vary considerably from year to year as a result of events beyond

<<<

 our control, and this can result in our paying higher premiums and periodically being unable to maintain the levels or types of insurance carried.
Although the insurance market has been stable for the last several years, it remains cyclical

<<<

 and catastrophic events can change the state of the insurance market, leading to sudden and unexpected increases in premiums and deductibles and unavailability of coverage due to reasons unrelated to our business. We have in the past experienced

<<<

 catastrophic events such as the fire at our Saugbrugs mill in February 2011, and if similar events were to occur in the future, such incidents could, along with other factors, cause our insurance premiums to increase or our insurance policies

<<<

 to be modified. For example, following the fire at our Saugbrugs mill in February 2011, our insurance policy was modified and we are now only covered for business interruptions lasting 11 days or more and up to 18 months. In addition, turmoil

<<<

 and volatility in the global financial markets may adversely affect the insurance market, which could result in some of the insurers in our insurance portfolio being unable to pay their share of claims. We are unable to assure you that actual

<<<

 losses will not exceed our insurance coverage or that such excess will not be material.
36

We are, and may in the future be, a party to legal or regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims which could have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are, and may in the future be, a party to legal or regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims arising out of the conduct of our business. The industry in which we operate

<<<

 has been, and may in the future continue to be, subject to heightened scrutiny in relation to environmental matters and the market in which we operate, which increases the likelihood that we are subject to legal proceedings and investigations

<<<

. Any claims asserted against us may harm our reputation, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any legal proceedings exceed our insurance coverage, or if the conclusions of any legal

<<<

 proceedings or investigations impose requirements in relation to our business, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Constant Perimeter Financial Information included in

<<<

 these listing particulars has been compiled from non-IFRS financial data based on certain assumptions, adjustments and estimates made by our management and is unaudited and unreviewed by our auditors.
These listing particulars present our Constant

<<<

 Perimeter Financial Information which includes the historic operating financial results of our existing portfolio of mills, Bruck, Golbey, Skogn, Albury, Boyer, Tasman, Walsum and Saugbrugs. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information has

<<<

 neither been audited nor reviewed by our independent auditors and includes information with respect to the production volumes, sales volumes, capacity, operating revenue, EBITDA and capital expenditures of the eight mills we currently operate

<<<

. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information does not reflect the results of our operations classified as Other activities in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which would require significant assumptions regarding the allocation of revenues

<<<

 and costs on a constant perimeter basis due to historic changes in the Group's structure. See ``Presentation of Financial and Other Information-- Constant Perimeter Financial Information'' and ``Summary--Summary Consolidated Financial and Other

<<<

 Information'' for additional details regarding the presentation of these results and their underlying assumptions. These assumptions are based on our historical unaudited management accounts and financial records, and they involve certain assumptions

<<<

 which were not at not at the time and have not since been reviewed with our auditors during the periods presented for conformity with IFRS reporting standards other than in conjunction with the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements

<<<

. For a review of our historical operating results under IFRS, please see the Consolidated Financial Statements included in these listing particulars beginning on page F-1.
The Constant Perimeter Financial Information is not intended to represent

<<<

 or to be indicative of the consolidated results of operations that our currently operational eight mills would have reported had the disposals of our Pisa, Singburi, Bio Bio, Follum, Parenco and Reparco operations occurred on January 1,201

<<<

1 and has not been adjusted to reflect any additional costs or revenues that might have resulted therefrom. Some of the factors that could have caused our financial performance to differ materially from that expressed or implied by the Constant

<<<

 Perimeter Financial Information had such disposals occurred on January 1, 2011 include increased expenses (including the need to incur additional materials or staff-related or other costs) due to increased production at our remaining mills

<<<

 during the historical period with an uncertain impact on our operating margin. Use of this financial data may, therefore, give an inaccurate reflection of what our current portfolio's operational results would have been had such disposal's

<<<

 occurred on January 1, 2011.
Risks Related to the Notes and the Guarantees
To service the Notes and our other indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash will depend on many factors beyond our

<<<

 control.
Our ability to make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness, refinance our indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements will partly depend on our ability to generate cash in the future

<<<

. This ability is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. See ``-- Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry''.
We cannot assure you

<<<

 that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that we will realize anticipated operating improvements on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service and repay the

<<<

 Notes and our other indebtedness or to fund our
37

other liquidity needs. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling

<<<

 assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that any refinancing, debt restructuring or additional financing would be possible, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold

<<<

, the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales would be sufficient to generate sufficient cash flows, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms.
If we default under our debt covenants

<<<

, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.
The indenture and the fiscal agency agreements governing the Parent's Existing Notes contain, and the indentures governing the Notes and the Exchange Notes will contain, a number of significant

<<<

 covenants that restrict our corporate activities, including our ability to:
 incur additional debt;
 make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions;
 create liens;
 sell assets;
 in the case of our restricted subsidiaries

<<<

, enter into arrangements that restrict dividends or other payments to us;
 engage in transactions with affiliates;
 create unrestricted subsidiaries; and
 consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets

<<<

 of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these

<<<

 covenants or restrictions, this would also result in an event of default under the Notes, Existing Notes and Exchange Notes. If the Existing Notes, the Notes or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated

<<<

, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other debt.
If the Parent, Norske Treindustrier AS, the Exchange Notes Issuer or the Issuer's subsidiaries are unable to make distributions and other payments to the Issuer

<<<

, the Issuer may be unable to pay amounts due on the Notes.
The Notes are obligations of the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors only, and not by any of our other subsidiaries. The Issuer is a holding company

<<<

 that does not directly conduct any business operations. The Issuer's only assets are the capital stock of its subsidiaries, many of which are themselves holding companies. Because the Issuer's operations are conducted solely by its subsidiaries

<<<

, the Issuer expects to obtain the funds required to make payments of principal or interest on the Notes through cash dividends, distributions or other transfers from its subsidiaries and/or payments to the Issuer by the Parent, Norske Treindustrier

<<<

 AS and/or the Exchange Notes Issuer of funds received by the Parent through the Group's intracompany financing arrangements. Therefore, the Issuer's ability to make payments of principal or interest on the Notes will be contingent upon the

<<<

 Issuer's subsidiaries generating sufficient cash, or the availability of cash under the Parent's cash pooling facility and from other intracompany funding arrangements, or from other payments, to make payments to the Issuer. The Parent, Norske

<<<

 Treindustrier AS, the Exchange Notes Issuer and the Issuer's subsidiaries may not be able to make distributions to the Issuer. Moreover, because some of the Guarantors are holding companies, the ability of such Guarantors to make payments on

<<<

 their Guarantees will be dependent on similar factors. The terms of certain of our outstanding debt and the indentures governing the Notes contain or will contain a number of significant covenants that restrict the Issuer's ability, and the

<<<

 ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, pay dividends or make other distributions, make capital expenditures, incur additional debt and grant guarantees. In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances

<<<

 by the Parent, Norske Treindustrier AS, the Exchange Notes Issuer or the Issuer's subsidiaries to the Issuer could be subject to restrictions on
38

dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions

<<<

 and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate.
Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and those of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation, contingent

<<<

 or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, the Notes. The

<<<

 Notes are not guaranteed by any of the subsidiaries that comprise the German publication paper production business at our Walsum mill site. Any right that the Issuer or the Guarantors have to receive any assets of any of our operating subsidiaries

<<<

 upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes, and the consequent right of holders of Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, may be effectively subordinated to the claims of such

<<<

 subsidiaries creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiaries.
The Guarantees by the Subsidiary Guarantors are subordinated to our existing and future senior debt and the Exchange Notes are subject to restrictions

<<<

 on payment and enforcement.
The Guarantees by the Subsidiary Guarantors are unsecured senior subordinated obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors and each is:
 subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness

<<<

 of that Subsidiary Guarantor (including that Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and certain commercial and financial obligations of a number of Guarantors);
 ranked pari passu in right of payment with any existing

<<<

 and future indebtedness (other than senior indebtedness) of that Subsidiary Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;
 ranked senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of such Subsidiary

<<<

 Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee; and
 effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness (including the Senior Secured Notes) or obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor that

<<<

 is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness.
In addition, no enforcement action with respect to the Guarantees (or any future Guarantee

<<<

 of the Exchange Notes, if any) may be taken unless (subject to certain limited exceptions): (i) any enforcement action has been taken with respect to senior debt (provided the Trustee and Holders of the Exchange Notes will be limited to taking

<<<

 the same action); (ii) an insolvency event has occurred in relation to the Issuer; (iii) with respect to any enforcement action on a Subsidiary Guarantor, an insolvency event has occurred with respect to the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor; 

<<<

(iv) there is a default on the Exchange Notes outstanding after a period of 179 days after the date on which the Security Agent or Senior Secured Notes Trustee with respect to senior debt delivers written notice of such default; (v) the expiry

<<<

 of any other standstill period outstanding at the date the standstill period referred to in (iv) above commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy); (vi) a default has occurred resulting from

<<<

 a failure to pay principal on the Exchange Notes at maturity or (vii) the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes have given their consent to the proposed action. See ``Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" .
Upon any distribution

<<<

 to the creditors of a Subsidiary Guarantor in a liquidation, administration, bankruptcy, moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding-up of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Holders of senior debt of such Subsidiary Guarantors will be

<<<

 entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to its Guarantee. As a result, Holders of the Exchange Notes may receive less, ratably, than the Holders of senior debt of the Subsidiary Guarantors, including the Holders

<<<

 of the Senior Secured Notes, and may not receive payment in respect of the Guarantees.
A Guarantee will terminate and be released upon, among other things, the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant

<<<

 Guarantor, the designation of such Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, the legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction or discharge of the Exchange Notes and in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions

<<<

 of the Intercreditor Agreement. See ``Description of the Exchange Notes--Note Guarantees--Note Guarantees Release" .
39

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement contains significant restrictions with respect to payments of the Exchange Notes

<<<

, including payments by the Issuer. If there is a payment default under the Senior Secured Notes, or if a senior payment stop notice is issued following an non-payment event of default under the Senior Secured Notes, then payments will not be

<<<

 permitted to be made in respect of the Exchange Notes unless the payment is made by the Issuer and funded directly or indirectly with amounts which have not been received by the Issuer from its subsidiaries.
In some circumstances, for instance

<<<

 where payments were received on the Exchange Notes in breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders would be required to turn over such payments to the Security Agent for redistribution. In addition, although the Holders of the Exchange Notes

<<<

 are generally entitled to enforce their claims against the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Notes Indenture, nevertheless the Intercreditor Agreement places limits on enforcement to the extent it would prejudice the enforcement

<<<

 by senior creditors of their security granted by the Issuer. See ``Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" .
As of September 30, 2014, after giving effect to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations and assuming 10

<<<

0% participation therein, we would have had an aggregate principal amount of outstanding financial liabilities (excluding derivative liabilities) that ranked senior to the Guarantees of 260 million.
Claims of our secured creditors will have

<<<

 priority with respect to their security over the claims of unsecured creditors, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
Claims of our secured creditors have priority with respect to the assets securing their indebtedness

<<<

 over the claims of our unsecured creditors. None of the assets that will secure the Senior Secured Notes will secure the Exchange Notes. Accordingly, each Guarantee will be effectively subordinated to the Guarantors' obligations under the Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes and any other secured indebtedness or obligations of the relevant Guarantor to the extent of the value of such assets. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other

<<<

 bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any Guarantor that has any such secured indebtedness or obligations, Holders of such secured indebtedness or obligations will have prior claims to the assets of such Guarantor that constitute their collateral

<<<

. Subject to the limitations referred to under the caption ``-- Fraudulent conveyance laws and other limitations on the enforceability and the amount of the Guarantees may adversely affect their validity and enforceability'', the Holders of

<<<

 the Exchange Notes will participate ratably with all Holders of the unsecured indebtedness of each relevant Guarantor (other than indebtedness to which the Guarantees have been expressly subordinated), and, potentially with all of their other

<<<

 general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each Holder or creditor, in the remaining assets of the relevant Guarantor (if any). In the event that any of the secured indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor becomes due or the

<<<

 creditors thereunder proceed against the operating assets that secured such indebtedness, the assets remaining after repayment of that secured indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the relevant Guarantee

<<<

. As a result, Holders of Exchange Notes may receive less, ratably, than Holders of secured indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor and may not receive payment in respect of the Guarantees.
As of September 30, 2014, after giving effect to the

<<<

 Exchange Offers, the Consent Solicitations (assuming 100% participation therein) and the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, we would have had an aggregate principal amount of 260 million of secured financial liabilities (excluding derivative

<<<

 liabilities) outstanding. We will be permitted to borrow substantial additional indebtedness, including senior debt, in the future, under the terms of the Exchange Notes Indenture.
Fraudulent conveyance laws and other limitations on the enforceability

<<<

 and the amount of the Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.
The Issuer's obligations under the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by, and secured on a firstpriority basis by certain

<<<

 assets of, the Guarantors and the ordinary shares, common stock or similar common equity interests (other than for directors' qualifying shares and equity interests of a similar nature) in each of the Guarantors (other than the Parent) as well

<<<

 as Norske Skog Walsum GmbH and Lysaker Invest AS. The Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests may be subject to claims that they should be limited or subordinated in favor of our existing and future creditors under the

<<<

 laws of their jurisdiction of organization, including Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Norway, New Zealand or other applicable jurisdictions. Enforcement of each Guarantee and any relevant Security Interest will be limited to the extent

<<<

 of the amount which can be guaranteed or secured by a particular
40

Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee or Security Interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. In addition, enforcement of any of the Guarantees and

<<<

 the Security Interest against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors and security providers generally. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, voidable

<<<

 preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Moreover, limitations arise under various provisions or principles

<<<

 of corporate law under the laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized which include rules governing capital maintenance under which, among others, the risks associated with a Guarantee on account of a parent

<<<

 company's debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor's or grantor's perspective, as well as thin capitalization and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations are not observed, the Guarantees

<<<

 by these Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge. In these jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed so that applicable local law restrictions will not be violated. No assurance can be

<<<

 given that such limiting language will be accepted by a court of law in the jurisdictions of the relevant Guarantor. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to

<<<

 be limited.
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and similar laws, a court could subordinate or void any Guarantee or the Security Interest provided by such Guarantor if it found that:


<<<

 the Guarantee was incurred or the Security Interest was created with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor;
 the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for

<<<

 the Guarantee or Security Interest;
 the Guarantor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee or Security Interest; or the Guarantor becomes insolvent within a specified ``hardening period'' following the issue of the

<<<

 Senior Secured Notes;
 the Guarantor was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee or Security Interest;
 the Guarantor intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay at maturity

<<<

;
 the Guarantee or the Security Interest was not in the best interests or for the benefit of the Guarantor; or
 the amount paid or payable under the Guarantee or realized from the Security Interest was in excess of the maximum amount permitted

<<<

 by law.
The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance and similar laws varies depending on the law applied. Generally, however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they became due. In

<<<

 such circumstances, if a court voided such Guarantee or Security Interest, or held it unenforceable, you would cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and the remaining Guarantors. You

<<<

 could also be required to return payments previously received from any such Guarantor. See ``Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests" .
Enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes and the Security

<<<

 Interests across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult.
The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is incorporated under the laws of Norway, and guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are organized or incorporated under the

<<<

 laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor. The rights under the Guarantees and the

<<<

 Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings

<<<

 are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors' rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization

<<<

 of the Issuer and the Guarantors may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors'
41

rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding

<<<

. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions' law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the Security Interests and to realize any recovery under the

<<<

 Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. See ``Service of Process and Enforcement of Certain Liabilities" .
Although the occurrence of specific change of control events affecting the Parent will permit you to require us to repurchase your Notes

<<<

, we may not be able to repurchase your Notes.
Upon the occurrence of specific change of control events affecting the Parent, you will have the right to require us to repurchase your Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and

<<<

 unpaid interest. Our ability to repurchase your Notes upon such a change of control event would be limited by our access to funds at the time of the repurchase and the terms of our debt agreements, which agreements could restrict or prohibit

<<<

 such a repurchase. Upon a change of control event, we may be required immediately to repay the outstanding principal, any accrued interest on and any other amounts owed by us under one or more of our credit facilities or offer to repurchase

<<<

 other notes that we have issued. The source of funds for these repayments would be our available cash or cash generated from other sources. However, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available upon a change of control

<<<

 to make these repayments and any required repurchases of tendered notes. See "-- We have a substantial amount of indebtedness maturing in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and we may not have adequate liquidity to satisfy our debt obligations as they become

<<<

 due''.
You may not be able to sell your Notes.
There is no existing market for the Notes. No application will be made to list the Temporary Notes or admit them for trading on any stock exchange. Although we will apply to list the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to have the Senior Secured Notes admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will remain listed. The Initial

<<<

 Purchasers of the Notes have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the Notes and may cease market making at any time

<<<

. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in our financial performance or in the markets where we operate may adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market in these Notes and the market price quoted

<<<

 for these Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will actually develop for these Notes.
Historically, the markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to disruptions that have caused

<<<

 substantial volatility in their prices. The market, if any, for the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes.
The transfer of Notes is restricted.
The Notes have not

<<<

 been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any jurisdiction and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the

<<<

 Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See ``Notice to U.S. Investors" and ``Transfer Restrictions" .
The interests of our shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the Notes.
The interests of our various shareholders

<<<

 could conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our shareholders could cause us to pursue acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend

<<<

 distributions or other transactions (subject to the limitations set forth in the Indenture) that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to holders of the Notes. Furthermore

<<<

, no assurance can be given that our shareholders will not sell all or any part of their respective shareholdings at any time or that they will not look to reduce their holding by means of a sale to a strategic investor, an equity offering or

<<<

 otherwise. Such divestitures may trigger a change of control under the Indenture. See ``--Risks Related to the Notes and the Guarantees--Although the occurrence of specific change o f control events affecting the Parent will permit you to require

<<<

 us to repurchase your Notes, we may not be able to repurchase your Notes" .
42

Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes.
The Notes will be denominated and payable in Euros. If investors measure their investment

<<<

 returns by reference to a currency other than Euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of Euros relative to the currency by reference

<<<

 to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. The depreciation of the Euro against the currency by reference to which such investors

<<<

 measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference

<<<

 to which such investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than United States dollars by United States investors may also result in important tax consequences as a result of foreign

<<<

 exchange gains or losses, if any. See ``Tax Considerations-- Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations' and ``--Risk Related to Taxation" .
You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations.
The Temporary

<<<

 Notes Issuer, the Issuer and all of the Guarantors are companies incorporated outside the United States. All of the directors and executive officers of the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United

<<<

 States. Although the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer and the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process

<<<

 within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer or the Guarantors. In addition, as most of the assets of the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer and the Guarantors and those of their

<<<

 respective directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws

<<<

 of the United States. Furthermore, we have been informed that it is questionable whether a court in Austria, Australia or the other home jurisdictions of the Issuer or the Guarantors located outside the United States would accept jurisdiction

<<<

 and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in such court predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.
Among other countries, the United States, Austria and Australia do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal

<<<

 recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely

 upon U.S. federal securities laws, may not be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Austria or Australia or other jurisdictions.
Australian, Austrian, French, German, Luxembourg, Norwegian and New Zealand insolvency laws and the laws

<<<

 of other jurisdictions may provide you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law.
In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or any other of the subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty

<<<

, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially

<<<

 different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, preferences, transactions at an undervalue and transactions defrauding creditors,

<<<

 the validity of certain floating charges, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain or claim interest following the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws

<<<

, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction's laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any

<<<

 amounts that you may receive.
Risks Related to the Collateral
The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes.
If there is an event of default

<<<

 on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets underlying their Security Interest. Not all of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' assets secure the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes and the Issuer and the Guarantors will not be required to take action to perfect all liens on assets which do secure the Senior Secured
43

Notes. In particular, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees are not secured by the property

<<<

 and assets of our paper mills in Austria, France, Germany or Norway. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will not be secured by certain receivables or related proceeds under our existing and future factoring and securitization

<<<

 programs. In the future, the obligations to provide additional Guarantees and grant additional Security Interests over assets, or a particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries

<<<

, the designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, is subject to certain agreed security principles (the ``Agreed Security Principles''). The Agreed Security Principles set forth in the Indenture set out

<<<

 a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted a Security Interest in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable

<<<

 under any Collateral provided being limited or a Security Interest not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the Security Interest provided by the Issuer

<<<

 and the Guarantors. To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes exceed the value of the assets securing those Senior Secured Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders

<<<

 of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the Senior Secured Notes is less than the value of the claims of

<<<

 the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of certain unsecured creditors are paid. Furthermore, upon enforcement against any Collateral, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to the proceeds of such enforcement may rank junior to the claims of hedge counterparties in respect of certain ``priority'' hedging agreements and the claims of creditors of certain `

<<<

`super senior'' secured indebtedness, in each case, to the extent permitted to be incurred under the Group's financing agreements (including the Indenture) or pari passu with the claims of the creditors of certain other indebtedness secured

<<<

 by the Collateral. In such instances, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive less from the proceeds of the Collateral in an enforcement action than if they were not required to share proceeds.
The Existing Notes are structurally subordinated

<<<

 to the Senior Secured Notes, the Exchange Notes and all of the creditors of any of the Parent's non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
While the Exchange Notes are guaranteed by certain of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, the Existing Notes will not be

<<<

 guaranteed by any subsidiaries of the Parent. Such non-Guarantor subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount due pursuant to the Existing Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends

<<<

, loans, distributions or other payments. As a result, the Existing Notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of any such subsidiaries, including the subsidiaries that Guarantee the Exchange Notes and the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes, in addition to the Senior Secured Notes and the Exchange Notes. All obligations of the Parent's subsidiaries, including trade payables and the Guarantees of the Exchange Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, will have to be satisfied before

<<<

 any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to the Parent.
The effects of the Senior Secured Notes offering and the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations on the Existing Notes

<<<

 could materially and adversely affect the credit risk inherent in, and significantly reduce protections afforded in, Existing Notes not validly tendered and accepted pursuant to the Exchange Offers.
Any Existing Notes not validly tendered pursuant

<<<

 to the Exchange Offers will remain outstanding. While there is no minimum acceptance condition for the Exchange Offers, if the required threshold for the applicable Consent Solicitation in respect of a series of Existing Notes is attained,

<<<

 the Proposals in respect of such series of Existing Notes will become operative, and Holders of the applicable Existing Notes that are not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Exchange Offers will be subject to the terms of the Existing Notes

<<<

 as modified notwithstanding the fact that they did not deliver consents. If the Proposals in respect of a series of Existing Notes become operative, depending on the series, some or substantially all of the restrictive covenants and (if applicable

<<<

) the related events of default will be eliminated. As a result, non-tendering Holders will no longer be entitled to the benefit of such provisions, which existed for the protection and benefit of Holders of the Existing Notes. The Existing

<<<

 Notes Indenture and Agency Agreements, as so amended, will continue to govern the terms of all Existing Notes that remain outstanding after the consummation of the Exchange Offers. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries may take certain actions

<<<

 in the future previously prohibited under the Existing Notes that
44

could adversely affect the market prices of the Existing Notes and otherwise increase the risks related to your investment in the Existing Notes. See ``The Proposals" .

<<<


Holders of Existing Notes (other than the 2033 Notes) that are exchanged for Exchange Notes will be subject to increased risk that we will be unable to repay (or refinance) the Exchange Notes when they mature.
Eligible Holders of Existing Notes

<<<

 (other than the 2033 Notes) are being offered Exchange Notes with a later maturity than the Existing Notes they presently hold, which mature in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Eligible Holders who tender their Existing Notes and whose tender is accepted

<<<

 for exchange will be exposed to the risk of nonpayment on the Exchange Notes they hold for a longer period of time than non-tendering Holders. For instance, following the maturity date of a given series of Existing Notes, but prior to the maturity

<<<

 date of the Exchange Notes, we may become subject to an insolvency or similar proceeding. If so, Holders of that series of Existing Notes who opted not to participate in the Exchange Offers may have been paid in full, and there is a risk that

<<<

 the Holders of Existing Notes who did opt to participate in the Exchange Offers and whose Existing Notes were accepted for exchange with the Exchange Notes would not be paid in full.
If not all Eligible Holders exchange their Existing Notes

<<<

 for Exchange Notes in the Exchange Offers, we will have ongoing obligations related to such remaining Existing Notes, which (other than the 2033 Notes) will mature prior to the Exchange Notes.
The Existing Notes Indenture and Agency Agreements

<<<

 require us, among other things, to make interest payments in cash on the Existing Notes on a semi-annual basis. We will be required to continue to make such payments until all of the Existing Notes that are not tendered mature, are repaid in

<<<

 full or are otherwise repurchased or retired. There is not a minimum tender amount condition for any of the Existing Notes in the Exchange Offers, so a substantial amount of Existing Notes may remain outstanding following the consummation of

<<<

 the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. In addition, the Exchange Notes will mature after the Senior Secured Notes (which mature in 2019) and certain of our other indebtedness. We will be required to repay Holders of the Existing Notes

<<<

 (other than the 2033 Notes) before the principal under the Exchange Notes is required to be repaid and we may not have the ability to borrow or otherwise raise the funds necessary to repay such amounts when due. Additionally, after such repayments

<<<

 we may not have sufficient cash to repay amounts owed under the Exchange Notes at maturity and may not have the ability to borrow or otherwise raise the funds necessary to repay such amounts.
Any Existing Notes that are not tendered in the

<<<

 Exchange Offers may be acquired, redeemed or repaid on terms that may be viewed as more, or less, favorable than the terms of the Exchange Notes offered in the Exchange Offers.
We (or other parties acting on our behalf) may acquire, redeem

<<<

 or repay Existing Notes that are not tendered in the Exchange Offers through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, other tender or exchange offers, redemptions, repayment at maturity or such other means as we deem appropriate

<<<

. Any such transactions will occur upon the terms and at the prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, which may be more or less favorable than the terms of the Exchange Offers, and could be for cash or other consideration. We may choose

<<<

 to pursue any or none of these alternatives, or combinations thereof, in the future.
The value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.
No appraisal

<<<

 of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering, and the fair market value of the Collateral may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions

<<<

 and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the

<<<

 sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, some of the assets that comprise the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding

<<<

, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.
45

To the extent that other first

<<<

-priority Security Interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture and the indentures governing the Existing Notes or the Exchange Notes and other rights encumber any of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, the

<<<

 holders of those liens and rights may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral

<<<

.
The Collateral does not include certain of our assets, including the property and assets of our paper mills in Austria, France, Germany or Norway, or the bank accounts of the Parent and our European operating subsidiaries. We presently have

<<<

 factoring and securitization programs in Europe and Australia, and the receivables and related proceeds under the European program will not secure the Senior Secured Notes. To the extent that the Senior Secured Notes are secured by receivables

<<<

 which are already secured pursuant to the Australian factoring arrangements, the Noteholders' security will be secondranking. In addition, the General Security Deed (as defined below) granting fixed and floating security over the assets of

<<<

 the Australian Guarantors does not include certain assets of the Australian Guarantors, including 29 tracts of land and standing timber on 333 tracts of land owned by Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited and pledged in favor of the State

<<<

 of Tasmania to secure the payment obligations of Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited under the terms of a loan agreement executed by Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited and the government of the State of Tasmania.
Certain of

<<<

 the Collateral will be second-ranking and subordinated in right of payment to existing security.
Certain of the Collateral is comprised of assets already pledged to secure other obligations of our Australian Guarantors under existing trade

<<<

, financing and/or leasing agreements. Under the terms of an amendment in 2012 to our supply and recovered paper agreement with News Limited (the ``News Agreement''), a significant amount was payable by News Limited to Norske Skog (Australasia

<<<

) Pty Limited. Payments of these sums are required to be applied by Norske Skog (Australasia) Pty Limited to Australian manufacturing cost reduction initiatives during the first three years of the agreement. Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia

<<<

) Limited granted a first-ranking mortgage in favor of News Limited in respect of these amounts over real property consisting of the majority of real property at our Albury mill site (but which real property does not include the Albury mill

<<<

 itself) (the ``Albury Real Property''). Two mortgages have been granted to secure Norske Skog (Australasia) Pty Limited's obligations under the News Agreement, both of which have been registered. The amount secured under the News Agreement

<<<

 will reduce in accordance with an amortization schedule set out in the agreement and is currently expected to reduce to nil in July 2015, whereupon the security granted in favor of the Security Agent over the Albury Real Property will become

<<<

 a first-ranking pledge of security (by way of the registration of a property mortgage) in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. See ``Description of Other Indebtedness" .
Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited granted two mortgages

<<<

 with respect to 310 tracts of land comprised of certain of the properties upon which are located the standing timber included in the Excluded Assets (the ``Boyer Real Property'' and together with the Albury Real Property, the ``Second Lien

<<<

 Property'') to secure its obligations under 15-year woodchipping services agreement with Bis Industries Limited executed in 2009 (the ``Bis Agreement''). The mortgages with respect to the Boyer Real Property are registered with the Tasmanian

<<<

 Land Titles Office and state that they will be released once the obligations of Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited under the Bis Agreement terminate and all moneys owed to Bis Industries Limited have been paid in full. Until such time

<<<

 as the relevant Australian Guarantors' obligations under the News Agreement and the Bis Agreement are paid in full or terminated, as the case may be, the security interests in the Second Lien Property securing the obligations of the Issuer

<<<

 under the Indenture will rank behind and be expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Security Interests in the Second Lien Property granted in favor of News Limited and Bis Industries Limited. See ``Description of Other Indebtedness

<<<

" .
The Collateral will include a Security Interest in all intercompany loans and receivables (excluding receivables relating to the Parent Guarantor's cash pooling arrangements) owed to the Parent Guarantors and any Excluded Entity as lenders

<<<

 or obligees, by the Issuer or any of the restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer. The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the obligations under these loans shall be released in the event of an enforcement against the Collateral. However

<<<

, the release of these intercompany loans may be limited by challenges or other claims on the grounds that such intercompany loans should be limited, subordinated or voided in favor of third-party creditors of the lenders of such loans under

<<<

 applicable law. For example, the intercompany loans could be challenged
46

because the loans are between related parties, were not made for adequate consideration or should be treated as a preference to the extent that the lender is deemed

<<<

 to be insolvent.
If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will rank equally with the creditors of other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness

<<<

 of the Issuer or relevant Guarantor with respect to any property or assets that are excluded from the Collateral.
The Senior Secured Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis by first-priority Security Interests and subject to Permitted Collateral

<<<

 Liens (as defined below). The Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment from the proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral to certain ``priority'' hedging obligations and certain other ``super senior'' secured

<<<

 indebtedness, in each case, to the extent permitted to be incurred under the Group's financing arrangements. The Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes will permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured by a lien that ranks equally

<<<

 with the Senior Secured Notes. Any such indebtedness may further limit the recovery from the realization of the value of such Collateral available to satisfy the claims of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The creditors of other indebtedness

<<<

 secured or to be secured (or deemed to be so secured pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement) over the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes will be entitled to be paid out of the proceeds of the Collateral upon a security

<<<

 enforcement action on a pari passu basis with holders of the Senior Secured Notes.
There may not be sufficient Collateral to repay the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any additional indebtedness that would be secured on the same

<<<

 basis as the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. In addition, liquidating the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes after also

<<<

 satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with pari passu liens. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent

<<<

 not repaired from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer's and the Guarantors' remaining assets.
The Security Interests in the Collateral will not be granted directly

<<<

 to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.
The Security Interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted

<<<

 directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent for the first-lien obligations, including the Senior Secured Notes, and any future first-lien obligations permitted to be secured by

<<<

 the Collateral under the Indenture. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have

<<<

 direct Security Interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee for the Senior Secured Notes, who will provide instructions to the Security

<<<

 Agent for the Collateral.
In certain jurisdictions in which Security Interests are being provided in favor of the Senior Secured Notes, including Austria, France and Germany, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection

<<<

 of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the relevant security documents and/or the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of ``parallel debt'' obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the Security

<<<

 Interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt only, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The parallel debt construct has not been tested

<<<

 in court in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral created under the parallel debt construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not

<<<

 receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the Security Interests in the Collateral. See ``Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests" .
The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the

<<<

 Collateral, and the sale ofparticular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes.
The security documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate

<<<

 and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing
47

the Senior Secured Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things

<<<

, without any release or consent by the Trustee or Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash

<<<

 payments, including repayments of indebtedness.
There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under which the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released automatically, without your

<<<

 consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent.
Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released automatically, including:
 a sale, transfer or other disposal

<<<

 of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture;
 with respect to Collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its Guarantee; and
 in connection with an enforcement

<<<

 sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture will also permit the Parent to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If the Parent designates a Guarantor as an unrestricted

<<<

 subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, all the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture. Designation

<<<

 of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary will be released. Under the Indenture, the Collateral will

<<<

 also be released in the event that the Senior Secured Notes achieve investment grade status until such time as the Senior Secured Notes cease to have investment grade status. The Collateral may also be released with the consent of holders of

<<<

 at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.
It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes.
The Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will

<<<

 be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of super senior, first-priority

<<<

 or secondpriority Security Interests in the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Senior Secured Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances

<<<

, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of

<<<

 Security Interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the Security

<<<

 Interests securing the Senior Secured Notes over certain Collateral in or under the laws of Australia and New Zealand will (in respect of land already pledged to News Limited and Bis Industries Limited held by Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia

<<<

) Limited, in respect of certain of Norske Skog (Australasia) Limited's receivables secured pursuant to factoring arrangements with Bibby Financial Services and in respect of land held by Norske Skog Tasman Ltd that will be unperfected only

<<<

 until the removal of the caveat to grant a lease to Mighty River Power Limited, upon which the Security Interest will be promptly perfected) be junior or unperfected Security Interests and holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have to rely

<<<

 on the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement for the treatment of such junior Security Interests as Security Interests ranking p a r i p a s s u with other first-ranking Security Interests securing other indebtedness of the Parent, the

<<<

 Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries.
The Security Interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need

<<<

 to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when

<<<

 required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security
48

Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.
The enforcement of share pledges may

<<<

 not be successful if the entities in which the shares are pledged are subject to existing agreements limiting their ability to make dividends to new shareholders (such as profit and loss pooling agreements) or limiting the control over such

<<<

 entity (such as domination agreements). The laws of certain jurisdictions do not generally permit an appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the occurrence of an enforcement event and usually require the sale of the relevant collateral

<<<

 through a formal disposal process involving a public auction. Certain waiting periods and notice requirements may apply to such disposal process.
In addition, our business requires a variety of national, state and local permits and licenses

<<<

. The continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and which depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited. Our business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely

<<<

 affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or changes in applicable regulations or requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to

<<<

 incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained or are

<<<

 delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may result and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.
The Collateral is subject to casualty risks.
We intend to continue to maintain insurance

<<<

 or otherwise insure against hazards in the manner described in these listing particulars. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate

<<<

 us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. In addition

<<<

, even if there is sufficient insurance coverage, if there is a total or partial loss of certain Collateral, there may be significant delays in obtaining replacement Collateral.
The rights of holders in the Collateral may be adversely affected

<<<

 by the Security Interests in Collateral not being perfected or being junior Security Interests.
In some jurisdictions, applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected

<<<

 and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the Security Interest, such as filings, registration or the publication of notices. The Security Interests in the Collateral may not be

<<<

 perfected, and their priority may not be retained, with respect to the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, if the Security Agent and/or the grantor of the Security Interest does not take the actions necessary to perfect any of the Security

<<<

 Interests on, or prior to, the date that the security is granted or as otherwise required by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. In particular, certain real property in New Zealand that includes our Tasman mill is subject to a caveat that

<<<

 prevents registration of the first-lien security interest granted in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes until the caveat is removed following the conclusion of negotiations of a lease agreement in respect of certain third-party

<<<

 facilities on the property (which registration will be undertaken promptly after such conclusion thereof). In addition, applicable law in some jurisdictions requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security

<<<

 interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.
You will not have a perfected Security Interest in certain of

<<<

 the Collateral on the Issue Date.
Until up to 90 days following the Issue Date, you will not have a perfected Security Interest in certain of the Collateral securing the Issuer and the Guarantors' obligations under the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

.
Subject to certain Agreed Security Principles, we will be required under the Indenture to perfect security over the Australian Guarantors' real property Collateral within 90 days following the Issue Date. See ` `D e s c r ip tio n o f th e

<<<

 S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s --S e c u r ity ". Failure to comply with these obligations would constitute a default under the Indenture.
49

Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery of Collateral may

<<<

 negatively impact the value of the Collateral.
Existing mortgages or other rights, including grants to local governments or third parties and certain water rights, may become enforceable and may impact the value of the Collateral.
The Issuer

<<<

 and the Guarantors have limited obligations to perfect some of the Security Interests in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the Trustee or the Security Agent for the Senior Secured Notes will monitor, or that the Issuer or Guarantors

<<<

 will inform the Trustee or Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the Security Interest in such after-acquired Collateral

<<<

. The Trustee and the Security Agent have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any Security Interest. Such failure may result in the loss of the Security Interest

<<<

 in the Collateral or the priority of the Security Interest in favor of the Senior Secured Notes against third parties.
The grant of Collateral to secure the Senior Secured Notes or the contractual subordination of the claims of certain of our

<<<

 creditors might be challenged or voidable in an insolvency proceeding.
The grant of Collateral and the contractual subordination of certain claims in favor of the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement may be voidable by the grantor

<<<

 or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent

<<<

 at the time of the grant, or if the grant or contractual subordination permits certain parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant or contractual subordination had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor

<<<

 is commenced within a legally specified ``clawback'' period following the grant. See ``L im ita tio n s o n V a lid ity a n d E n fo r c e a b ility o f th e G u a ra n te e s a n d th e S e c u r ity In te r e s ts " .
Creditors under certain

<<<

 hedging obligations permitted to be incurred under the indenture will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Senior Secured Notes.
The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees

<<<

 will be secured by the same Collateral securing the obligations under certain hedging obligations that we may enter into in the future. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the liabilities under certain hedging obligations

<<<

 may have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and other assets that are part of

<<<

 the Collateral must first be applied in satisfaction of obligations under such ``priority'' hedging obligations (and certain other ``super senior'' indebtedness to the extent permitted to be incurred under the Group's financing arrangements

<<<

) and thereafter to repay on a p a r i p a s s u basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees and certain other p a r i p a s s u indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted

<<<

 to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if in the event of any realization or enforcement of the Collateral the then

<<<

 outstanding claims under certain ``priority'' hedging obligations (and certain ``super senior'' indebtedness) are greater than the proceeds realized, and if there are any remaining proceeds following repayment of certain ``priority'' hedging

<<<

 obligations (and certain ``super senior'' indebtedness) in full, such proceeds shall be shared pro rata and p a r i p a s s u between the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and certain other p a r i p a s s u creditors.
Under the intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be required to share recovery proceeds with other secured creditors, have limited ability to enforce the security documents and have agreed that the Collateral may be released in certain

<<<

 circumstances without their consent.
Creditors of future indebtedness secured by the Collateral will each accede to the Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the agents and representatives of the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral

<<<

. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the security documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the

<<<

 release of the Collateral by the Security Agent.
50

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may release the Collateral in connection with sales of assets pursuant to a permitted disposal or enforcement sale and in other

<<<

 circumstances permitted by the relevant financing documents. Therefore, the Collateral available to secure the Senior Secured Notes could be reduced in connection with the sales of assets or otherwise, subject to the requirements of the financing

<<<

 documents and the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes.
Moreover, the enforcement of the Security Interests in respect of our Austrian subsidiary may be limited if a court-appointed trustee (K u ra to r) is appointed under Austrian

<<<

 law. Following the appointment of such court-appointed trustee, neither the trustee for the Senior Secured Notes nor individual Senior Secured Noteholders will have the power to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Noteholders

<<<

' collective rights under the Senior Secured Notes. No assurance can be given that such court-appointed trustee will exercise its powers in accordance with the best interests of the Senior Secured Noteholders. In addition, the Noteholders will

 not be able to direct the actions taken on their behalf by the court-appointed trustee.
Risks Related to Taxation
Payments under the Notes may be subject to withholding tax under the Savings Directive on the taxation of savings income.
Under

<<<

 EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the ``Savings Directive''), each member state of the European Union (a ``Member State'') is required to provide to the tax authorities of another

<<<

 Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a paying agent (within the meaning of the Savings Directive) located within its jurisdiction to, or for the benefit of, an individual resident or certain limited types

<<<

 of entities established in that other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Austria and Luxembourg will instead apply a withholding system in relation to such payments unless during such period they elect otherwise, deducting tax

<<<

 at a rate of 35% (subject to a procedure whereby, on meeting certain conditions, the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that no tax be withheld). The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full

<<<

 financial year following agreement by certain non-European Union (``EU'') countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments. Further to Law of November 25, 2014, as of January 1,2015, and within the scope of the Savings Directive

<<<

, the automatic exchange of information for all interest and interest-assimilated payments made or ascribed by a Luxembourg paying agent to or for the immediate benefit of individuals resident and so-called residual entities established in another

<<<

 Member State will replace the 35% withholding tax.
A number of non-EU countries have adopted similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to

<<<

, or for the benefit of, an individual resident or certain limited types of entities established in a Member State. In addition, the Member States have entered into provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain

<<<

 of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made by a person in a Member State to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entities established in one of those territories

<<<

.
The EU Council adopted certain changes to the Savings Directive on March 24, 2014. Members States have until January 1,2016 to adopt national laws to implement these changes (which laws must then be applied from January 1, 2017). The changes

<<<

, when implemented, will broaden the scope of the requirements described above. Investors who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisers.
If a payment to an individual were to be made or collected through

<<<

 an EU Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment pursuant to the Savings Directive or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council

<<<

 meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to the Savings Directive, neither the Issuer nor any paying agent nor any other person would be

<<<

 obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. The Issuer is required to maintain a paying agent with a specified office in an Member State that is not obliged to withhold or

<<<

 deduct tax pursuant to the Savings Directive or any other directives implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced

<<<

 in order to conform to the Savings Directive or any agreement entered into by a new EU Member State with (i) any other state or (ii) any relevant dependent
51

or associated territory of any EU Member State providing for measures equivalent

<<<

 to or the same as those provided by the Directive. The Notes may be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Notes may be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. investors in the Notes

<<<

 will generally be required to include OID in their gross income as it accrues in advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to such income using the constant yield method if the Notes are treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal

<<<

 income tax purposes. See `` Tax C o n s id e ra tio n s -- C e rta in U.S. F e d e ra l In c o m e Tax C o n s id e ra tio n s -- O rig in a l Issu e D is c o u n t".

USE OF PROCEEDS The net proceeds from the Offering were 277.8 million

<<<

. We will use the proceeds to address a portion of the short-term and medium-term maturities of the Parent's Existing Notes, for working capital purposes and to pay the fees and expenses associated with the Transactions. The Existing Notes mature

Overview
We are a leading global publication paper company with total production capacity of 3.0 million tons at our eight mills in Europe and Australasia. We are one of the world's leading producers of newsprint and are a significant

<<<

 producer of magazine paper by production capacity. In Europe, we operate five mills in Norway, Germany, Austria and France with 2.3 million tons of publication paper production capacity, making us the third largest European producer of publication

<<<

 paper. In Australasia (which includes Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and the neighboring islands), we operate two mills in Australia and one mill in New Zealand with 0.7 million tons of publication paper production capacity. We also operate

<<<

 Australasia's sole newsprint and magazine paper mills, making us a leading provider of publication paper in the region.
Our newsprint paper products include standard and improved grades, while our magazine paper products comprise uncoated super

<<<

-calendared paper and light-weight coated paper. The end uses of our products are mainly newspapers and magazines, but also include catalogs, inserts/flyers, supplements, free-sheets, directories, direct mail and brochures. Our principal geographic

<<<

 markets for newsprint products are Europe and Australasia, while our main geographic markets for magazine paper products are Europe, Australasia and North America. We sell our products in these markets under well-known brands, including Nornews

<<<

, Norbright, NorX, Norstar, Norcote, Norsc, Norbook, Vantage and Tasman Directory. Our customers include publishers of leading periodicals in Europe, Australasia and the rest of the world, and we have long-standing relationships with many of

<<<

 our top tier publishing clients.
Positioning Within the Industry
Overview of Industry Trends
Significant trends affecting the paper industry include (i) a fundamental structural change in paper consumption as demand for global paper consumption

<<<

 declines and (ii) a geographic shift in production and demand from traditional markets, such as North America and Western Europe, to Asia and Latin America.
A long-term demand decline for paper globally has been driven principally by technological

<<<

 developments which are influencing economic, demographic and end-user preference trends. Alternative methods of media consumption that have shifted consumer preferences towards digital platforms have negatively impacted publication paper. Global

<<<

 overcapacity has been driven by this demand decline and exacerbated by some capacity buildup in Asia over the past decade.
To reduce the levels of overcapacity and address the current market imbalance, industry participants have engaged in

<<<

 both consolidation and capacity closures, which have resulted in substantial capacity reductions in North America, Western Europe, Japan and other traditional markets. North America has been a first mover in consolidation and reduction of capacity

<<<

 over the past several years with Europe following. Both markets have become more consolidated, which has helped to address the overcapacity issues. North America remains a more consolidated market than Europe, except in relation to uncoated

<<<

 mechanical, which suggests that there is still room for consolidation in the European publication paper markets.
Our Response
As a result of the broader industry declines, we have endured a protracted period of operational losses. We have sought

<<<

 to address the long-term decline in publication paper demand through a series of
57

divestments and production facility closures as well as diversification of our production capacity. See ``-- F a c to r s A ffe c tin g C o m p a r a b ilit

<<<

 y - S ig n if ic a n t d is p o s a ls o r r e d u c tio n s in c a p a c it y " . The net effect of these actions has been to reduce our production capacity by 32% from 4.3 million tons of annual production capacity as of December 31, 201

<<<

0 to 3.0 million tons of annual production capacity as of September 30, 2014. In reducing our capacity, we have retained our operations in Europe and Australasia, which we believe benefit from significant intra-regional synergies, while divesting

<<<

 our operations in Asia and Latin America where we lacked such synergies.
In addition to capacity reduction, and in order to improve our operating margins, we have also made various investments in cost reduction initiatives and higher margin

<<<

 production lines at certain of our continuing operating facilities. See ``--L iq u id ity a n d C a p ita l R e s o u r c e s -- C a p ita l e x p e n d itu r e s " . Our renewed focus on optimizing our working capital has increased our ability

<<<

 to make such investments. Our working capital requirements have declined faster than other Group requirements since 2011. We have reduced our working capital requirements primarily through reductions in inventories and an improved control of

<<<

 accounts receivable. See ``--L iq u id ity a n d C a p ita l R e s o u r c e s -- W o rk in g C a p ita l
R e q u ire m e n ts" .
Operating Segments
With effect from January 1, 2014, we manage and operate our business through two operating

<<<

 segments: Publication Paper Europe and Publication Paper Australasia. Activities of our Group that do not fall into either of the two operating segments are presented under Other Activities.
E u ro p e . The Publication Paper Europe segment

<<<

 encompasses production and sale of newsprint and magazine paper in Europe. Our five European mills and the regional sales organization are included in the operating segment Publication Paper Europe.
A u s tra la s ia . The Publication Paper

<<<

 Australasia segment encompasses production and sale of newsprint and magazine paper in Australasia. Our three mills in Australasia and the regional sales organization are included in the operating segment Publication Paper Australasia.
O th

<<<

 e r A c tiv itie s . Activities in our Group that do not fall into either Publication Paper Europe or Publication Paper Australasia are presented under Other Activities. This includes mainly corporate functions and some minor real estate activities

<<<

.
E lim in a tio n s . Eliminations represent intra-group eliminations. Since January 1, 2014, eliminations generally relate to intra-group services, primarily corporate headquarters operations. Historically, in addition to intra-group services

<<<

, eliminations included sales of energy to internal parties and other activities. Eliminations items reduce both operating revenue and cost of materials.
As described under ``--F a c to rs A ffe c tin g C o m p a r a b ilit y - C h a n g e s

<<<

 in r e p o r tin g s e g m e n ts " , during the periods under review in this discussion, we have changed our operating segments with effect from January 1, 2012 and, again, with effect from January 1, 2014.
Significant Factors Affecting Our

<<<

 Results of Operations
Our business is affected by a number of important trends and factors. The most significant of these trends and factors are discussed below.
Paper prices and volumes
The primary factors affecting our results of operations

<<<

 are the prices and volumes of newsprint and magazine paper that we sell.
P u b lic a tio n p a p e r p ric e s . The prices at which we are able to sell our newsprint and magazine paper depend mainly on the balance between supply and demand

<<<

 and, to a lesser extent, on the quality characteristics of our publication paper and the destinations and terms of delivery. Since 2011, most of our European newsprint contracts allow for price adjustment on a quarterly or semi-annually basis

<<<

, which, while tying our revenues more closely to fluctuations in market prices for newsprint and enabling us to respond more flexibly, introduces more volatility into our results over the course of any given year. Newsprint in Australasia is

<<<

 generally sold under contracts with pricing fixed for several years. Magazine paper is typically sold under contracts with terms of up to one year with pricing adjusted on a quarterly basis.
58

P ro d u c tio n c a p a c ity . During the

<<<

 last 15 years, digital distribution of published media content and advertisements has become increasingly widespread. This development has challenged the publication paper industry, which has endured a protracted structural decline in demand

<<<

, the effects of which have been exacerbated by cyclical demand declines tied to the 2008-2009 financial crisis and its effects on subsequent global economic growth. For paper makers, it has at times been difficult to react quickly to the effects

<<<

 of structural and cyclical demand shortfalls, which has resulted in industry-wide overcapacity.
V o lu m e s s o ld . The volumes of newsprint and magazine paper we are able to sell are mainly affected by market demand and by the inventory

<<<

 levels of our customers.
M a r k e t d e m a n d fo r n e w s p r in t a n d m a g a z in e p a p e r. The global demand for publication paper is strongly influenced by macroeconomic factors, consumer preferences and technological changes.

<<<

 Contractions in the economy typically lead to reductions in advertising spending and, as much of the demand for our products is generated directly or indirectly by advertising, our results will fluctuate with the general state of the economy

<<<

.
C o n s u m e r p re fe r e n c e s a n d h a b its . Demand for our products is also impacted by changes in consumer preferences and habits. With the rise of the Internet and electronic media, the publication paper industry in North America

<<<

 has witnessed a structural change in demand, with a decline in demand for most parts of print media, and newspapers in particular. In Europe, this trend has been less pronounced, but we currently expect that publication paper demand in Europe

<<<

 will continue to decline gradually. To the extent that advertising by electronic media continues to represent an increasing share of the advertising market at the expense of print media, or if consumer preferences or more stringent environmental

<<<

 regulations further disfavor paper, our revenues will be impacted.
Increases in the cost of our raw materials and energy
Our key raw materials are energy and fiber. Fiber is sourced as wood and as recovered paper. Energy and fiber costs represented

<<<

 43% of our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Input factor costs have in general been stable in recent years. This stability is a result of relatively modest input factor price volatility due to our contracting

<<<

 structure for energy and wood as well as improvements in fiber and energy consumption as a result of investments at some of our mills.
E nergy. We are a producer of publication paper, which is among the most energy-intensive types of paper

<<<

 to produce. Energy is our single most important expense, and amounted to 21% of our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. For this same period, 53% of our energy cost related to the purchase of electricity, while

<<<

 the remainder mainly related to purchases of thermal energy used to dry paper. As of September 30, 2014, approximately 85% of our Group-wide electricity requirements were bought under long-term contracts. As a cost of publication paper production

<<<

, our exposure to spot market energy prices is limited primarily to the European continent. See ``--F lu c tu a tio n in th e v a lu e o f e n e rg y c o n tr a c ts " for a description of the impact of fluctuations of energy contracts on our

<<<

 results of operations.
W o o d . We source wood for our operations through a variety of means. We purchase our wood in Australia pursuant to long-term contracts, and for the Boyer mill, approximately 70% of its wood requirements are sourced

<<<

 from its 20,000 hectares of forest assets. In Norway and continental Europe, wood is purchased pursuant to short- and medium-term contracts.
R e c o v e re d p a p e r. Recovered paper supplies are largely purchased through short-term contracts

<<<

, mainly at market prices. There have been relatively small fluctuations in recovered paper prices in recent years. We primarily use recovered paper in our European newsprint operations.
T ra n s p o rta tio n . Transportation costs comprise

<<<

 both the costs related to the delivery of our finished products to our customers, which are recorded in our income statement as distribution costs, and costs related to the delivery of raw materials to our mills, which are recorded in our income

<<<

 statement as cost of materials. We are responsible for the shipping costs in respect of the majority of our raw material purchases and sales of our finished products and our results are therefore subject to changes in transportation costs,

<<<

 largely due to fluctuations in fuel prices.
59

Fluctuation in the value of energy contracts
We enter into energy supply contracts based on our estimates of the amount of energy we will require to operate our business in the future. Under

<<<

 certain of these contracts, due to capacity reductions or other reasons, the amount of energy we require is less than we contracted for, and we resell the excess energy in the market. Historically, energy resales were a significant factor affecting

<<<

 our results. Presently, however, most of our mills are sourced to need and energy resales will not be expected to have the same impact on our future results of operations. In addition to resale revenues, we operate a geo-thermal energy production

<<<

 facility co-located at our mill in New Zealand from which we generate revenue from sales of excess energy into the spot energy market.
Under IFRS, contracts containing embedded derivatives are valued either with the whole contract or separately

<<<

 at fair value. Fair value is calculated as the difference between the projected market price and the projected contract price over the contract period, discounted to present value. Changes in fair value are recorded as income or expense, as

<<<

 applicable, in our income statement. Since the fair value is based on market expectations for energy prices and currency, interest rates and price indices, changes in fair value produce large fluctuations in our results of operations due to

<<<

 the large volumes and contract lengths associated with energy contracts. We revalue our energy contracts every quarter. Due to volatility in the market price of energy and certain currencies, it is impossible to predict what the impact of such

<<<

 revaluation will be on our income statement and balance sheet from quarter to quarter. These accounting effects have no impact on cash flow.
As of September 30, 2014, the book value of our commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity

<<<

 contracts was NOK 56 million. The fluctuations are non-cash items that are recorded in the income statement under other gains and losses.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Norwegian

<<<

 kroner. Items reflected in the consolidated financial statements of each of our subsidiaries are initially recorded using the currency of the primary economic location in which the entity operates (except for the years ended December 31, 2

<<<

011,2012 and 2013 for our subsidiaries in Latin America, where the functional currency was the U.S. dollar). Transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the

<<<

 transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of these transactions and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period-end exchange rates are recognized as realized

<<<

/unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency in our income statement. Exchange rate differences arising from the settlement of accounts receivable/payable and unrealized gains/losses on the same positions are recognized in operating revenue

<<<

/cost of materials, respectively. Gains and losses that relate to borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and currency hedging are presented in our income statement as financial items. Subsequently, upon consolidation, the accounts of our subsidiaries

<<<

 that are presented in currencies other than Norwegian kroner are translated into Norwegian kroner at Norges Bank's official rates prevailing on our balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for

<<<

 the period. Any exchange differences arising are recognized as comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves.
Our results of operations are subject to both translation effects and transaction effects as a result of fluctuations

<<<

 in exchange rates. While our reporting currency is the Norwegian kroner, our subsidiaries generate revenue and incur costs primarily in Euro, U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, Australian dollars and New Zealand dollars (in addition to Norwegian

<<<

 kroner). For example, for the year ended December 31, 2013, 77.0% of our operating revenues were derived from European markets other than Norway and from Australasian markets, where prices and costs are denominated and paid in currencies other

<<<

 than Norwegian kroner. As of September 30, 2014, 91.8% of our total interest-bearing non-current liabilities were denominated in currencies other than Norwegian kroner, with approximately 58.5% denominated in Euro and 30.8% in U.S. dollars

<<<

. Consequently, our results are affected by any material depreciation or appreciation of these currencies against the Norwegian kroner.
Currency transaction effects primarily relate to our Norwegian operations, which incur expenses mainly in

<<<

 Norwegian kroner, but which sell a large proportion of their output on the export market and generate revenue in foreign currency (primarily Euro, pounds sterling and U.S. dollars). However, we currently do not have any outstanding currency

<<<

 hedging agreements (see ``-- Im p a c t fro m c u rr e n c y c h a n g e s a n d

From time to time, we hedge parts of our expected cash flow in foreign currency. The purpose of

<<<

 this is to improve predictability of our cash flows. Forward contracts and options may be used to hedge cash flows. See ``-- Q u a lita tiv e a n d Q u a n tita tiv e D is c lo s u r e s a b o u t M a r k e t R is k - E x c h a n g e ra te

 r is k " .
Increases in interest rates
We primarily have fixed-rate borrowings, which are carried as liabilities on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2014, the total carrying value of all total interest-bearing liabilities was NOK 7,6

<<<

04 million, and the total value of cash and cash equivalents was NOK 500 million.
For a discussion of our past hedging activities with respect to interest rates, see ``-- Q u a lita tiv e a n d
Q uantitative D isclo su re s a b o u t M a rk

<<<

 e t R isk-- In te re st rate ris k " .
Impact of decline in value of fixed assets
We are required to determine the value of our fixed assets (principally the machines we use in our mills) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate

<<<

 that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events can include the closure of a mill or a reduction in the production capacity of a mill. When the carrying amount exceeds the net present value of future cash flows from the asset,

<<<

 the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in our income statement.
Cost control and operational efficiency
A proportion of our total operating expenses are fixed, which means that profitability, particularly in an environment of declining

<<<

 prices, depends in part on cost control and operating efficiency. During the periods under review, we have implemented a number of cost control and operational efficiency programs and measures, and we continue to monitor opportunities to implement

<<<

 further programs and measures. In addition to mill closures and disposals and production suspensions, these programs and measures have included the optimization of energy usage at our mills, the consolidation of sales and distribution resources

<<<

 and use of sales agents and the streamlining of headquarter operations. Due to the combination of mill closures and disposals and cost-reduction initiatives, our employee headcount decreased from 5,078 employees as of December 31,2011 to 2

<<<

,944 employees as of September 30, 2014. In general, the effects of cost control and operational efficiency programs and measures are reflected in improvements in operating expense items, gross operating earnings and gross operating margins

<<<

. We may also record restructuring expenses in connection with cost-reduction initiatives, which can be significant. For example, we recorded NOK 59 million of restructuring expenses in 2011 for a cost-reduction program at the Walsum mill.
Acquisitions

<<<

 and disposals
During the periods under review we have made a number of significant disposals and reductions in capacity. In addition, in the future we may make further disposals and other reductions in capacity and potentially may make acquisitions

<<<

 in line with our business strategy. Any of these actions may significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. See ``-- F a c to rs A ffe c tin g C o m p a r a b ility - S ig n ific a n t d is p o s a ls o r r e d u c

<<<

 tio n s in c a p a c ity " . We may incur substantial additional debt in connection with any acquisition.
Seasonality
In general, market demand for our products is not constant over the year. We typically experience strong seasonal demand in

<<<

 the fourth quarter due to Christmas advertising and Christmas catalogs, and in the Northern hemisphere, we experience a seasonal increase in demand in the second quarter due to the printing of holiday brochures ahead of the summer holiday season

<<<

. For example, for the three months ended March 31, 2014, we generated gross operating earnings of NOK 153 million, while our gross operating earnings for the three months ended December 31,2013 were NOK 298 million. For reasons related to operational

<<<

 efficiency, we maintain production levels relatively stable throughout the year, such that seasonal increases in demand are satisfied through inventory. Consequently, changes in inventories can be significant from quarter to quarter, although

<<<

 from one year to the next, the overall change in inventories is typically small.
61

Factors Affecting Comparability
The key factors affecting comparability of our results of operations during the periods under review include:
Changes in reporting

<<<

 segments
Due to changes in our business and the way we operate and manage our business during the periods under review, we have made several changes to our operating segments. These changes affect comparability of our results of operations

<<<

 during the periods under review.
Effective January 1, 2014, we reorganized our operations into two geographically-oriented operating segments: Publication Paper Europe and Publication Paper Australasia. During the years ended December 31,2

<<<

013 and 2012, we had previously organized our operating segments by geography and product class in three operating segments: Newsprint Europe, Newsprint Outside Europe and Magazine Paper. The two Newsprint segments reported figures for the newsprint

<<<

 assets located in Europe and the rest of the world, respectively, and the results of our European magazine paper operations were reported under Magazine Paper. Prior to 2012, in addition to our two Newsprint operating segments and our Magazine

<<<

 Paper operating segment, we maintained an Energy operating segment. The activities of the Energy operating segment have been included in our financial reporting under Other Activities with effect from January 1, 2012.
In these listing particulars

<<<

, we have presented our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to reflect the retrospective effect of the January 1, 2014 change to operating segments as if such change had occurred January 1,2013. We have not prepared

<<<

 or presented in these listing particulars operating segment information reflecting the retrospective effect of the January 1,2014 change to operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012.
In this discussion, in order to enhance

<<<

 the comparability of the results of operations for our operating segments, the segment financial information for the year ended December 31,2011 has been presented to give effect to the January 1,2012 elimination of the Energy operating segment

<<<

 and the inclusion of the Energy operating segment's prior activities within Other Activities as if such change had occurred with effect from January 1, 2011.
The comparability of the operating segment financial data for the years ended December

<<<

 31,2011 and 2012 is also impacted by the reclassification of the results of operations of the Parenco mill (whose single paper mill had the capability to produce both newsprint and magazine paper). During 2011, the results of operations of

<<<

 the Parenco mill were reported in the Newsprint Europe operating segment; during 2012, the Parenco mill's results of operations were reported in the Magazine Paper operating segment. The Parenco mill was disposed of in August 2012.
Significant

<<<

 disposals or reductions in capacity
During the periods under review, as part of our strategy to streamline and refocus our business, we have disposed of a number of our businesses and assets and reduced production capacity through permanent

<<<

 closures:
 D is p o s a l o f B ra z ilia n P isa o p e ra tio n s (2 0 1 3 ). We sold a majority interest in the Pisa business in Brazil, which had an annual production capacity of 185,000 tons in June 2013 and sold the remaining 49% minority

<<<

 interest in 2014.
 D is p o s a l o f T h a ila n d S in g b u r i o p e ra tio n s (2 0 1 3 ). We sold the Singburi newsprint mill in Thailand in November 2013.
 C lo s u re o f W a lsu m p a p e r m a c h in e (2 0 1 3 ). We permanently

<<<

 closed one of the paper mills at the Walsum mill in Germany with an annual production capacity of 225,000 tons of coated paper in December 2013.
 C lo s u re o f T asm a n p a p e r m a c h in e (2 0 1 3 ). We permanently closed one of the

<<<

 two paper mills at the Tasman mill in New Zealand with an annual production capacity of 160,000 tons of newsprint in January 2013.
 D is p o s a l o f C h ile a n B io B io o p e ra tio n s (2 0 1 2 ). We sold the Bio Bio newsprint mill in

<<<

 Chile in 2012.
62

 D is p o s a l o f F o liu m m ill (2 0 1 2 ). In December 2011, we closed the Folium mill in Norway, which produced newsprint and magazine paper. In June 2012, we sold the land and the energy contracts related to the

<<<

 mill.
 D is p o s a l o f P a re n c o m ill (2 0 1 2 ). We sold the Parenco mill in the Netherlands, which produced newsprint and magazine paper, in August 2012.
 D is p o s a l o f R e p a rc o (2 0 1 2 ). We sold the Reparco global recovered

<<<

 paper business in August 2012.
 D is p o s a l o f B ra z ilia n a s s e ts (2 0 1 1 ). We sold certain Brazilian forestry holdings and energy sales operations in 2011.
The disposal of businesses and assets and the reduction of production

<<<

 capacity have a number of effects on our results of operations. In general, disposals and reductions of capacity result in decreases in operating revenues, operating expenses and gross operating earnings in subsequent periods. In some cases

<<<

, the disposal of a profitable business, such as the Pisa mill in Brazil, can negatively impact gross operating margins in subsequent periods. We may recognize one-time gains or losses as a result of disposals, which are recorded as other gains

<<<

 and losses in the income statement. We have generally applied a portion of the proceeds from disposals to reduce our indebtedness.
We generally will record restructuring expenses in connection with reductions of capacity through closures. For

<<<

 example, we recorded NOK 287 million of restructuring expenses in 2011 in connection with the closure of the Follum mill (which was subsequently sold) and n Ok 105 million of restructuring expenses in 2012 in connection with the closure of

<<<

 newsprint capacity at the Tasman mill. We may also record significant impairment charges with respect to the planned closure of capacity. Closures may also have a positive impact on working capital and operating cash flow, due to the release

<<<

 of working capital following such closure.

Implementation of accounting standard IAS 19
We implemented the amended accounting standard IAS 19 Employee Benefits with effect from January 1,2013, with full retrospective application. We have included

<<<

 restated 2012 financial information for the purposes of comparison in these listing particulars to give effect to this implementation. For a description of the implementation effects of amended accounting standard IAS 19, see note 13 to our

<<<

 Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Impact from currency changes and other factors under financial items
Effective from October 2014, we terminated our remaining currency hedging agreements. Historically

<<<

, our forward contracts and currency options were subject to fair market valuation at the end of each financial quarter, changes in which were recognized in our income statement as a financial item. As a result, the currency impact of changes

<<<

 in exchange rates on our results, which is recognized in our income statement, could be significant. Net translation effects in respect of foreign currencydenominated debt could also be significant, primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated debt

<<<

, as we do not have many assets in U.S. dollars. Translation differences on most of the other debt denominated in foreign currencies were generally together with assets in the same currency, and the translation difference was recognized in equity

<<<

. Furthermore, we have from time to time repurchased our debt securities as part of the management of our capital structure and have recognized gains and losses as a result of such repurchases.

Disruptions or

<<<

 other stoppages in production capacity
Our results of operations can be impacted by disruptions or other stoppages in our production capacity. These events can be due to involuntary reasons, such as fires, or voluntary reasons, such as the

<<<



63

conversion of a paper machine or the temporary idling (or the reduction in utilization rates) of a paper machine to address issues such as inventory build-ups or energy price developments. The impact on our results of operations of such

<<<

 events depends on the nature of the disruption or stoppage, and other factors such as whether the event is covered by insurance (including business interruption insurance to cover lost margins).
From mid-December 2013 until April 2014, operations

<<<

 at one of the two paper machines at our Boyer mill were suspended. While the machine was offline, we converted the machine to produce magazine paper instead of newsprint. The converted machine is our first magazine paper machine in Australasia

<<<

, and the only magazine producing machine in that market. During the period of the machine's conversion, production capacity at our Boyer facility declined from 22,500 tons of newsprint per month to 12,500 tons of newsprint per month. Following

<<<

 the conversion, the Boyer mill has capacity to produce 12,500 tons of newsprint per month and 11,667 tons of magazine paper per month. As a result of the conversion, revenues and gross operating earnings for the Publication Paper Australasia

<<<

 operating segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were negatively impacted. We expect that our results of operations will be positively impacted as the Boyer magazine paper machine reaches its anticipated production and performance

<<<

 levels.
On February 2, 2011, there was a fire at our Saugbrugs mill in Norway, which produces supercalendared magazine paper and has an annual production capacity of 545,000 tons of supercalendared magazine paper. That fire caused extensive

<<<

 damage to the cable system in the TMP plant that supplies the mill's machines with wood fiber. As a result, all operations of the mill's paper machines were halted. The Saugbrugs mill did not return to normal production levels until January

<<<

 2012. We maintain insurance coverage that includes both the lost contribution margin (business interruption insurance) and property damage stemming from covered events. As a result of the 2011 fire at Saugbrugs, a provision for the estimated

<<<

 business interruption compensation was recognized, whereby gross operating earnings were negatively affected by NOK 11 million, which was equivalent to the insurance policy deductible. Additionally, we recognized an impairment of NOK 8 million

<<<

 for the assets damaged during the year ended December 31,2011 and a gain of NOK 83 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 in other gains and losses relating to the insurance compensation received for property damage.
Explanation of Key

<<<

 Income Statement Items
Operating revenue
Operating revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from the sale of our products, and is stated net of any applicable value added tax, rebates and sales and after

<<<

 eliminating sales within the Group.
Our operating revenue consists almost exclusively of the sale of goods, and the recognition of revenue is the same for newsprint and magazine paper. Operating revenue is typically recognized at a point in

<<<

 time between finalization of production of our products and delivery of the products to our customer, depending on the buyer's delivery terms.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses are comprised of distribution costs, cost of raw materials

<<<

, changes in inventories, employee benefit expenses and other operating expenses.
D is trib u tio n c o s ts . Distribution costs represent the cost of transporting our finished products to our customers.
C o s t o f m a te ria ls . Cost of

<<<

 materials includes the raw materials used to make our products, which includes the price of various energy sources used by our mills, wood, recovered paper and pulp, together with distribution costs related to delivering the raw materials to

<<<

 our mills.
C h a n g e s in in v e n to rie s . Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value and the change in inventories from a prior period is recognized as a change in inventories. Gains or losses on the sale of

<<<

 our inventories are recognized on a first-in-first-out basis.
E m p lo y e e b e n e fit e x p e n s e s . Employee benefit expenses include salaries, bonuses and the cost of other employee benefits such as payments to defined benefit and defined

<<<

 contribution plans.
64

O th e r o p e ra tin g e x p e n s e s . Other operating expenses includes costs relating to maintenance, administration, changes in environmental provisions and other miscellaneous expenses.
G ro s s o p e ra tin

<<<

 g e a rn in g s . In the income statement of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we present gross operating earnings for the Group, and in our segment reporting, we assess the performance of our operating segments based on a measure of gross

<<<

 operating earnings. Gross operating earnings excludes the effects of expenditure not deemed to be part of regular operating activities. Gross operating earnings represents operating earnings before depreciation, restructuring expenses, other

<<<

 gains and losses (such as gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in the fair value of certain energy contracts and biological assets) and impairments. In these listing particulars, EBITDA is defined on the same basis

<<<

 as gross operating earnings. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit/loss, see ``S u m m a ry C o n s o lid a te d F in a n c ia l a n d O th e r D a ta " and ``P r e s e n ta tio n o f F in a n cia l a n d O th e r In fo rm a tio n --N on

<<<

-IFR S a n d O th e r F in a n cia l M e a s u re s ."
Restructuring expenses Restructuring expenses include redundancy payments, early retirement payments and other arrangements for employees leaving the Group, legal costs in relation to reduction

<<<

 in headcount and legal and other costs associated with disposals and other restructuring transactions, including mill or paper machine closures. We do not recognize provisions for future operating losses.
Other gains and losses Other gains

<<<

 and losses includes gains and losses on disposals, gains and losses that arise from changes in fair value of our commodity contracts, embedded derivatives in energy contracts and biological (forestry) assets and gains or losses arising upon

<<<

 the sale of our rights to purchase energy under our long-term energy contracts.
Impairments An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of a relevant asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognized as

<<<

 a charge to our income statement through impairments.
Share of profit in associate companies We account for investments in associated companies in accordance with the equity method. Our share of profit is recognized as our percentage share

<<<

 of profit after tax, adjusted for amortization of surplus value at Group level allocated to the investment at the time of acquisition. We own a 33.7% minority interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd. (``MNI''), which is our only

<<<

 material associated company. See note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 for further information regarding MNI.
Financial items F in a n c ia l in c o m e . Financial income includes interest income

<<<

 and gains on the repurchase of outstanding bonds.
F in a n c ia l e x p e n s e s . Financial expenses include interest costs and other financial items such as finance costs related to financing arrangements.
R e a liz e d /u n re a liz e d

Europe. Operating revenue in our European segment decreased by 0.7% to NOK 6,720 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to NOK 6,764 million in the nine months

<<<

 ended September 30, 2013. This decrease in operating revenue was principally due to lower sales volume attributable to the closure of one of two paper machines at the Walsum mill in December 2013, which was partly offset by improved pricing

<<<

. Total volume of publication paper sold by us in Europe in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by 8.4% to 1,502,000 tons, compared to 1,639,000 tons in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Demand for European publication

<<<

 paper fell 4.0% during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, which reflected a decline in demand for European newsprint of 5.1% and a decline in demand for European magazine paper of 3.2% as compared to the nine months ended September 

<<<

30, 2013. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, prices for European newsprint increased slightly while prices for European magazine paper decreased in the same period compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013, based on

 prices in Germany established by RlSl. SC prices were flat, while LWC prices decreased slightly.
Australasia. Operating revenue from our Australasian segment decreased by 26.1% to NOK 2,229 million in the nine months ended September 30, 20

14, compared to NOK 3,014 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The decline reflects the impact of the divestments of Pisa in Brazil (June 2013) and Singburi in Thailand (November 2013) and lost production capacity from our Boyer

<<<

 mill during the conversion of one of its two paper machines to magazine paper operations during the first quarter of 2014. Demand for Australasian publication paper fell 4.1% during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, which reflected

<<<

 a decline in demand for Australasian newsprint of 6.1% and a decline in demand for Australasian magazine paper of 2.4%. Prices for Australasian newsprint remained relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the

, the disposal of Parenco in the Netherlands and weak results at our Bruck facility in Austria. The results also reflected higher per unit costs for both wood and energy at our continuing magazine paper operations.
O th e r A c tiv itie s .

<<<

 Gross operating earnings from our Other Activities were negative NOK 56 million in 2013 and negative NOK 116 million in 2012. The improvement primarily is due to a more streamlined headquarters function following cost reduction initiatives

<<<

.
Depreciation
Depreciation decreased by 22.1% to NOK 728 million in 2013 compared to NOK 935 million in 2012. The decrease was due to lower depreciation charges at our Walsum and Tasman facilities in 2013 following significant impairments recorded

<<<

 in 2012. As a percentage of operating revenue, depreciation decreased from 5.6% of operating revenue in 2012 to 5.5% of operating revenue in 2013.
Restructuring expenses
In 2013, restructuring expenses were NOK 145 million compared to NOK 

<<<

118 million in 2012. Restructuring expenses in 2013 consisted primarily of charges related to severance payments and other
73

costs in connection with the closure of a paper machine at Walsum. Restructuring expenses in 2012 primarily related

<<<

 to the closure of a newsprint paper machine at Tasman.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a loss from other gains and losses of NOK 1,100 million, compared to a loss of NOK 1,009 million in

<<<

 2012. In 2013, 73.2% of our losses from other gains and losses stemmed from losses incurred due to changes in the value of commodity contracts (NOK 402 million) and embedded derivatives (NOK 403 million). The losses on commodities contracts

<<<

 were primarily due to lower than expected future energy prices and currency effects. These currency effects also accounted for the losses on embedded derivatives contracts. The losses in 2013 were primarily related to the appreciation of the

<<<

 Euro relative to the Norwegian kroner.
The losses from divestment of business activities, property, plant and equipment of NOK 178 million in 2013 related primarily to losses of NOK 218 million incurred in the divestment of the Pisa operations

<<<

 in Brazil, which were partly offset by gains of NOK 49 million from the sale of the Singburi operations in Thailand and adjustments for the reclassification of certain of these losses and gains upon the loss of control of these companies. We

<<<

 also recognized a gain of NOK 23 million from the sale of non-production related property, which further offset these losses. We also included a loss of NOK 26 million in relation to input VAT on transaction costs incurred upon the divestments

<<<

 of mills in South Korea and China in previous years.

Impairments
We recognized no impairment charges in 2013 compared to NOK 2,086 million in 2012. The 2012 impairment charges related primarily to the revaluation of our operations at our Tasman

<<<

 and Walsum facilities following the decision to close one newsprint machine at our Tasman facility and the closure of one magazine paper machine at our Walsum facility.

Operating earnings
We recognized operating earnings of negative NOK 1

<<<

,111 million in 2013 compared to operating earnings of negative NOK 2,663 million in 2012. The primary reason for the decrease in losses in 2013 compared to 2012 was the impact of significant impairment charges recognized in 2012.

 revenue
Operating revenue in 2012 decreased by 12.2% to NOK 16,592 million compared to NOK 18,904 million in 2011. The reduction in operating revenue was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of the global decline in demand in the

 2012 compared to NOK 6,034 million in 2011, reflecting the impact of the closure of our Follum mill and the reclassification of the Parenco mill operations within the Magazine Paper segment. Total volume of European newsprint sold in 2012 decreased

<<<

 by 20.2% to 1,187,000 tons compared to 1,488,000 tons in 2011. The decrease in our European sales volumes principally related to the closure of Follum. Demand for newsprint in Europe fell 13.0% in 2012 as compared to 2011. Newsprint prices

 in Europe decreased slightly from 2011 to 2012.
-- Outside Europe. Operating revenue from our Newsprint segment outside Europe decreased by 7.3% to NOK 5,263 million in 2012 compared to NOK 5,681 million in 2011, principally due to the divestment

 of our Bio Bio operations in Chile. Total volume of newsprint sold outside of Europe

76

decreased by 8.2% to 1,093,000 tons in 2012 compared to 1,190,000 tons in 2011, which decrease was largely due to the disposal of Bio Bio. Demand for

 to 2011.
M a g a z in e P a pe r. Operating revenue from our Magazine Paper segment in 2012 decreased by 0.6% to NOK 6,254 million compared to NOK 6,291 million in 2011. The decrease in operating revenues reflected weaker pricing for magazine

 paper in 2012 as compared to 2011. Total volume of magazine paper sold in 2012 increased by 11.0% to 1,308,000 tons, compared to 1,178,000 tons in 2011. The increase in sales volumes reflected the net impact of the reclassification of the Parenco

<<<

 mill operations and the consolidation of its results within the Magazine Paper operating segment and the resumption of production at the Saugsbrug mill which had undergone repairs following a fire at the mill in February 2011. Demand for uncoated

 . Distribution costs decreased by 7.9% to NOK 1,645 million in 2012 from NOK 1,786 million in 2011 primarily due to the closure of our Follum mill in Norway and the sale of our Bio Bio operations in Chile. As a percentage of operating revenue

<<<

, distribution costs increased from 9.4% of operating revenue in 2011 to 9.9% of operating revenue in 2012. This increase in distribution costs relative to operating earnings was primarily due to changes in customer mix as our continuing operations

 of the Follum mill and the sale of our Bio Bio operations. As a percentage of operating revenue, employee benefit expenses increased slightly from 14.8% of operating revenue in 2011 to 15.0% of operating revenue in 2012, which reflected the

<<<

 net effect of slightly higher employee expenses at our newsprint operations outside of Europe offset by savings in employee expenses in our European Newsprint operating segment. We had 3,986 employees as of December 31, 2012 and 5,075 employees

<<<

 sales of newsprint from our Tasman operations. As a percentage of segment operating revenue, gross operating earnings of our non-European Newsprint segment increased from 16.1% in 2011 to 16.7% in 2012, which reflected the generally improved

 pricing for non-European newsprint sales, which were offset by higher per unit material (energy and wood) and per unit distribution costs.
M a g a z in e P a p e r. Gross operating earnings of our Magazine Paper segment were NOK 349 million

 in gross operating earnings relative to operating revenue reflected the reduced per units costs of wood and energy for our Magazine Paper operations in 2012, which were offset by slightly reduced pricing for magazine paper over the same period

.
O th e r A c tiv itie s . Gross operating earnings from our Other Activities segment were negative NOK 116 million in 2012 and NOK 95 million in 2011, primarily due to higher costs for corporate functions, including costs in connection with

Depreciation
Depreciation decreased by 43.6% to NOK 935 million in 2012 compared to NOK 1,658 million in 2011. As a percentage of operating revenue, depreciation decreased from 8.8% of operating

 revenue in 2011 to 5.6% of operating revenue in 2012. The decrease in depreciation expense in 2012 was primarily due to NOK 1,969 million of impairment charges recorded in 2011.

Restructuring expenses
Restructuring expenses decreased by NOK

<<<

 269 million to NOK 118 million in 2012, compared with NOK 387 million in 2011. Restructuring expenses in 2012 consisted primarily of severance payments as well as expenses stemming from the decision to permanently close one paper machine and

<<<

 160,000 tons of newsprint capacity at Tasman in New Zealand in January 2013. Restructuring expenses in 2011 related primarily to the decision in December 2011 to close the Follum mill, which closure and disposal was completed in June 2012.

Total financial items amounted to a loss of NOK 117 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared

<<<

 to a loss of NOK 629 million for the year ended December 31,2011. The decrease in loss is primarily due to the effects of the appreciation of the Norwegian kroner against other major currencies in 2012 on the value of debt denominated in such

 non-NOK currencies. Other financial income in both 2011 and 2012 reflects the gain on purchases of our debt securities.

Income taxes
We recognized a tax income of NOK 69 million in 2012 compared to a tax income of NOK 588 million in 2011.

<<<

 The reduced income taxes were primarily due to reduced loss before income tax, an increase in tax losses not recognized and reduced recognition of tax assets in 2012.

Net profit/loss Net loss for the year was NOK 2,781 million in 2012 compared

Historically, our principal source of liquidity has been our operating cash flows, committed credit facilities asset sales and issuances of debt securities. In recent periods, our operating cash flows have not been sufficient to

<<<

 meet our liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014, our net cash flow from operating activities was NOK

<<<

 68 million and NOK (224) million, respectively. In addition, during 2013 we reduced the size of and subsequently canceled, our committed revolving credit facility, which we partly replaced with a securitization facility at our Norwegian mills

<<<

. We have supplemented our liquidity needs with asset dispositions and the

80

establishment of factoring and securitization facilities. We have also obtained government grants and loans in connection with certain of our capital expenditures

<<<

 projects. We will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Temporary Notes to address a portion of the short-term and medium-term maturities of the Parent's Existing Notes, for working capital purposes and to pay the fees and expenses associated

<<<

 with the Transactions. The outstanding Existing Notes mature in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2033.
We believe that our expected operating cash flows, together with available borrowings, cash on hand and the proceeds from this Offering, will be adequate

<<<

 to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and scheduled interest and principal payments on our indebtedness during 2015. While the Offering of the Temporary Notes and the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed

<<<

 Consent Solicitations will extend the maturities of a significant portion of our indebtedness, such transactions will also result in significantly higher interest costs. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient operating cash

<<<

 flows or proceeds from asset dispositions, or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. The Parent's auditors, Ernst & Young, have informed us that, in their view, our

<<<

 financial statements for the third quarter of 2014 do not contain required disclosures addressing the going concern uncertainty as the Parent, in their opinion, needs profit improvement and/or reduction of debt/refinancing/new equity in order

<<<

 to continue its operations. The Parent's Board of Directors authorized for issuance the Consolidated Financials Statements on October 22, 2014, and noted in the Directors' Report for the Third Quarter of 2014 that the Board has full focus on

<<<

 the Parent's upcoming bond maturity in October 2015 and is considering several options. As discussed in this section of the listing particulars, we will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Temporary Notes to (among other things) address

<<<

 a portion of the short-term and medium-term maturities of the Parent's Existing Notes (including through the Proposed Exchange Offers) and for working capital purposes. We believe that the potential significant risks to our liquidity include

<<<

:  a reduction in operating cash flows due to a decline in the profitability of our business, which could
be due to downturns in our performance, the publication paper industry in Europe or Australasia or general economic conditions;  if the

<<<

 Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations are not consummated, our short-term and medium-term maturity indebtedness will require us to repay U.S.$158.2 million, 129.6 million and 388.5 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively

<<<

, including maturities in 2016 and 2017; and  a reduction in sales or gross operating earnings due to our inability to successfully manage working capital and attain further operational cost savings. If our future operating cash flows and other

<<<

 capital resources (including availability under our factoring and securitization facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:  reduce or delay our capital expenditures

<<<

;  close or curtail operations at our mills and further reduce our sales and overhead staffs;  dispose of assets;  obtain additional debt or equity capital; or  refinance all or a portion of our debt. There can be no assurance that we would

<<<

 be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and our outstanding Existing Notes, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue

<<<

 any of these alternatives.

Working Capital Requirements
We actively monitor and

<<<

 manage our working capital requirements. Generally, our working capital requirements are seasonal and we experience slightly lower cash flow in the first half of the year due to the ramp up in working capital and production of inventories.

<<<

 The focus on optimizing our working capital has been a top priority and our working capital requirements have declined faster than other Group requirements since 2011. We have reduced our working capital requirements primarily through reductions

<<<

 in inventories and an improved control of accounts receivable. The release of working capital over the past three years has been a positive contributor to our cash flow.

 include investments in improving the current business.
Our capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 totaled NOK 201 million and were comprised of:
 NOK 112 million of Operational Capital Expenditures, which were mainly

 at our Saugbrugs mill, finalizing the new TMP plant which ultimately cost NOK 188 million.
Our capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled NOK 519 million and were comprised of:
 NOK 151 million of Operational Capital

<<<

 Expenditures. The unit with the biggest portion of the NOK 151 million was our headquarters, where NOK 25 million were invested to upgrade our central IT systems.
 NOK 368 million of Development Capital Expenditures, of which NOK 242 million

<<<

 was invested at our Boyer mill and NOK 82 million was invested at our Saugbrugs mill. The investments at our Boyer mill were mainly related to the conversion of one paper machine to magazine paper production while we commenced construction

<<<

 of the new TMP plant at our Saugsbrug mill.
Our capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled NOK 471 million and were comprised of:
 NOK 150 million of Operational Capital Expenditures, of which NOK 67 million was invested

<<<

 at our two Norwegian mills.
 NOK 321 million of Development Capital Expenditures, of which NOK 108 million and NOK 110 million was invested at our Boyer and Tasman mills, respectively. In 2012, we started work on the AUD 84.8 million conversion

<<<

 project of one paper machine to the production of magazine paper at our Boyer mill and we finalized and commissioned the geothermal power plant at our Tasman mill.
Our capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled NOK 40

<<<

2 million and were comprised of:
 NOK 298 million of Operational Capital Expenditures, of which NOK 129 million was invested in our Saugbrugs mill. The main portion of this investment was related to the rebuilding of the TMP plant following

We estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately NOK 250 million, of which the remaining investments will be for Operational Capital Expenditures related to minor maintenance

<<<

 projects at several of our mills.
We estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2015 will be NOK 156 million, substantially all of which is expected to be Operational Capital Expenditures.

There are

 no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures

 or capital resources that is material to investors. We do not have any material exposure associated with non-consolidated conduits, structured investment vehicles or collateralized debt obligations.
Derivatives
We use derivative instruments

<<<

 to hedge our exposure to the fluctuation in exchange rates and commodity prices, primarily energy prices.
Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to various financial risks through our operating activities

<<<

, including market risk (interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity price risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. We seek to minimize losses and volatility on our earnings caused by adverse market movements. We monitor and manage financial

<<<

 risk based on internal policies and standards set forth by corporate management and approved by the Board of Directors. These written policies provide principles for the overall risk management, as well as standards for managing exchange rate

<<<

 risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and standards is continuously monitored.
Interest rate risk
There has historically

<<<

 been a correlation between economic trends and interest rate movements, with interest rates falling during an economic downturn and rising in an economic recovery. We seek to structure our debt portfolio such that interest costs partly offset

<<<

 changes in revenue as a consequence of changes in the economic climate. The goal of interest rate risk management is to secure the lowest possible interest rate payments over time within acceptable risk limits. In the current challenging



<<<

85

situation in the publication paper market, we have secured most of the interest rate payments by primarily paying fixed interest rates on our debt obligations.

, 2012 and 92.9% as of December 31, 2011.

Exchange rate risk
Due to our position as an international paper production company with a significant cost base in Norway, we incur significant costs in Norwegian kroner while our sales are predominantly

<<<

 in foreign currencies.
We are exposed to currency risk in the following areas:
 translation risk, where assets and debt valued in foreign currencies have to be translated into Norwegian kroner on our balance sheet; and
 transaction risk,

<<<

 which arises as a result of our positive cash flow being predominantly in foreign currencies, while our negative cash flow is predominantly in Norwegian kroner.
Translation risk arises when our accounts are consolidated in Norwegian kroner

<<<

 and translation differences arise on assets and debt denominated in foreign currencies. The value of our assets and debt are adjusted for this translation difference, thereby affecting important key ratios such as our gearing ratio (net interest

<<<

-bearing debt to equity). Translation risk is managed by ensuring that our net debt is denominated in a mix of currencies in which we also hold assets, in order to reduce fluctuations in key financial ratios resulting from currency rate movements

<<<

. However, the net investment hedging is also organized in such a way as to distribute debt to currencies in which we have positive cash flows. In the past, we have used currency and interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge

<<<

 net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
In the past, we have used various financial instruments to hedge our exposure to currency transaction risk. In general, we calculate a twelve-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling

<<<

 basis (the ``roNing cash flow hedge''). At any one time, a portion of our twelve-month expected cash flow exposure is hedged using forward contracts and currency options. This portion may be as low as zero and as high as 100%, but our benchmark

<<<

 is 75%. Our aim is to postpone the effect of currency fluctuations on our cash flow. The hedging instruments we may use are forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options, currency swaps, cross-currency swaps and loans denominated

<<<

 in foreign currencies. We do not use hedge accounting for the rolling cash flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a loss of NOK 66 million in 2013, a gain of NOK 149 million in 2012 and a loss of

86

NOK 13 million in 2011. Over

<<<

 time, currency losses or earnings are expected to offset increased or reduced future gross operating earnings.
S e nsitivity analysis
As of December 31, 2013, if the NOK had appreciated 10% against all currencies to which we have significant

<<<

 exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 265 million higher (NOK 292 million higher as of December 31,2012 and NOK 464 million higher as of December 31, 2011). If the NOK had depreciated by 10% as of December

<<<

 31,2013 against all currencies to which we have significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 285 million lower (NOK 292 million lower as of December 31, 2012 and NOK 503 million lower as of December

<<<

 31,2011). Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner due to changes in fair value of options. The effect of the sensitivity analysis on our income statement is mainly caused by changes in fair value of derivatives designated as

<<<

 rolling cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange gains/losses on the translation of Euro and U.S. dollar denominated debt for which there is no hedge accounting. Due to the fact that the portion of debt decreased in relation to the portion of

<<<

 cash, the effect on the income statement was lower in 2013 compared to 2012.
Given a 10% appreciation/depreciation of the Norwegian kroner, equity would have been NOK 189 million higher/lower (NOK 180 million higher/lower as of December 31

<<<

, 2012 and NOK 378 million higher/lower as of December 31, 2011) as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on financial instruments designated as net investment hedges.
The sensitivity analysis on equity excludes the effects from the above

<<<

-calculated sensitivity analysis on our income statement.
Commodity risk
A major part of our global commodity demand, primarily energy, is purchased through long-term contracts. We only use financial instruments to a small degree to hedge these

<<<

 contracts. The hedging ratio represents a trade-off between risk exposure and the opportunity to take advantage of short-term price drops in the spot market. Hedging levels are regulated through mandates approved by the Board of Directors.

<<<


Certain of our purchase and sales contracts are derivatives, or contain embedded derivatives, which fall within the scope of IAS 39. These derivatives are measured in our balance sheet at fair value with value changes recognized through profit

<<<

 or loss. Commodity contracts are either financial contracts for the purpose of trading or hedging, or physical commodity contracts that are not for the purpose of our own use. The embedded derivatives are common in physical commodity contracts

<<<

 and comprise a wide variety of derivative characteristics.
Changes in fair value of commodity contracts reflect unrealized gains or losses and are calculated as the difference between market price and contract price discounted to present value

<<<

. Some commodity contracts are bilateral contracts or embedded derivatives in bilateral contracts, for which there exists no active market. Hence, valuation techniques which use available market information are used as much as possible. In the

<<<

 absence of observable market information, valuation techniques that reflect how the market could be expected to price instruments are used.
Our portfolio of commodity contracts consists mostly of physical energy contracts. Fair value of commodity

<<<

 contracts is therefore especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations.
In April 2013, we signed a new long-term energy contract

<<<

 for the supply of electricity for our paper mill in Halden. The new energy contract secures an annual supply of 1.0 terawatt-hours (``TWh'') up to December 2020. The agreement became effective on May 1, 2013. The contract ensures almost full

<<<

 energy coverage for the paper mill in Halden over the contract period. During 2013, we also terminated one of our long-term group energy contracts from 1998 that we used for energy supply in Southern Norway.

Trading and hedging mandates have been established for energy activity. Financial trading and hedging activities are carried out bilaterally with banks and trading companies. When calculating fair value of

Credit risk
We make a credit evaluation of all financial trading counterparties. Based on the evaluation, a limit on credit exposure is established for each counterparty

<<<

. These limits are monitored continuously in relation to unrealized profit on financial instruments and placements. The maximum credit risk arising from financial instruments is represented by the carrying am ount of financial assets on our

<<<

 balance sheet. This includes derivatives with positive market value except for embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives are not subjected to credit risk, as there are no future cash flows associated with such derivatives.
We trade with a

<<<

 group of large Nordic and international banks which are publicly rated in the interval from A A - to A - (unchanged from 2012). The credit risk on deposits and derivative transactions is spread across theses banks.
Our procedures for credit

<<<

 management of European trade receivables, and the authority to approve credit lines to customers of European business units, are regulated by a policy drafted and maintained by a centralized credit management function at our head office. The

<<<

 operational responsibility to act within the guidelines as set out by this policy lies with each business unit. For operations outside of Europe, custom er credit m anagement is handled locally.

Critical Accounting Policies
Our principal accounting

 policies are described in more detail in note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31,201 3 included elsewhere in these listing particulars. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance

 could differ from the estimates.
Management believes that the accounting policies below represent those matters requiring the exercise of judgm ent where a different opinion could result in the greatest changes to reported results.

 decline in value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment ("PPE")
We perform periodic tests to assess whether there has been a decline in the value of intangible assets and tangible fixed assets. Tangible fixed assets and intangible

<<<

 assets are written down to their recoverable am ount when the recoverable am ount is lower than the assets carrying value. The recoverable am ount from assets or cash-generating units is determined by calculating the higher of fair value less

<<<

 costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates.
The capitalized value of intangible

<<<

 assets and PPE within the cash-generating units is measured against the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within these units. A possible future change in the com position of our cash-generating units could mean changes in the value

<<<

 in use within cash-generating units, which could, in turn, mean a future decline in the value of intangible assets and tangible fixed assets.
Calculating the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within the cash-generating units is based

<<<

 on estimated discounted cash flows. The cash flow horizon in the impairment model is consistent with the useful life of each paper machine in the group. The board-approved operating plan for the next year form s the basis for calculating expected

<<<

 cash flows. In the impairment testing, sales prices are assumed

88

to exhibit a decline in real terms and variable costs are assumed to decline in real terms, with lower demand for input factors due to a shrinking industry.
The estimation

<<<

 of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty

<<<

 when it comes to the outcome of the calculations. We perform sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations will impact recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of the

<<<

 present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate used. Changes in these factors will have the effect of altering the value of cash flows and

<<<

 thereby also the value in use within the cash-generating units. Significant changes in prognoses and long-term prices could accordingly mean a future fall in the value of intangible assets and tangible fixed assets.
The required rate of return

<<<

 applied when discounting future cash flows is crucial for the calculated value of intangible assets and PPE. A future increase in the required return when discounting future cash flows will reduce value in use and could, in turn, mean a future

<<<

 decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. We use

<<<

 our judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The contracts are recognized in our balance sheet in accordance with IAS 39, which means that the

<<<

 value consists of the difference between the estimated market price and contract price over the contract period, discounted to present value. If the market for contracts is not active, we apply valuation techniques to establish the fair value

<<<

. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments which are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analyses.
The value can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to changes in

<<<

 expected future energy prices, and is also affected by changes in exchange rates, price indices and the discount rate used.
Annual assessment of the remaining economic life of tangible fixed assets
We make annual assessments of the remaining

<<<

 economic life of tangible fixed assets. An increase or decrease in the remaining economic life could have an effect on future depreciation.
Provision for future environmental obligations
Our provision for future environmental obligations is

<<<

 based on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment. Changes in any of these assumptions could have an impact on our provision and costs.
Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities

<<<

 and legal claims are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated

<<<

.
Where a number of similar obligations exist, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with

<<<

 respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects

<<<

 current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized within financial items.
As of December 31,2013, we had a provision for future

<<<

 environmental obligations of NOK 193 million which are presented on our balance sheet as other non-current liabilities.
89

Residual value and dismantling provision The residual value of our production equipment is valued as the anticipated

<<<

 realizable value on our balance sheet date, after deducting the estimated costs relating to asset dismantling, removal and restoration. If the estimated costs exceed the estimated residual values, the net liability is added to the fixed asset

<<<

 cost in our balance sheet and a provision is recognized as a liability. We perform a review of the residual value of our production equipment at the end of each accounting year. Residual value is affected by short-term changes in the underlying

<<<

 assumptions, for example scrap metal prices. A change in the residual value could have an impact on future depreciation costs. The provision for dismantling costs is based on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment. Pensions

<<<

 The present value of the pension obligation depends on several input factors that are determined by means of a number of actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the net pension expense (income) includes the discount rate

<<<

. Changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying value of the pension obligation.

Demand Drivers
Significant trends affecting the paper industry include (i) a fundamental structural change in paper consumption as demand for global paper consumption declines and (ii) a geographic shift in production and demand from traditional

<<<

 markets, such as North America and Western Europe, to Asia and Latin America. Long-term demand for paper globally is driven by economic, demographic and end-user preference trends, as well as by technological development.

91

Technological

<<<

 development and shifting consumer preferences towards digital platforms have negatively impacted publication paper demand over the past decade. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that there is a long-term need for publication paper. According

<<<

 to the World Association of Newspaper and News Publishers, print remains by far the most important source of revenue for news publishers, accounting for 93% of newspaper revenue as of 2014, with only 7% of revenue derived from electronic media

<<<

. The continued need for printed media is confirmed by our two most important customers in Australasia, News Limited and Fairfax Media Limited, which together account for approximately 50% of our Australasia revenue. News Limited and Fairfax

<<<

 Media Limited are large multi platform media companies but they continue to derive the majority of their revenues from traditional printing and continue to make large investments in printing equipment.
Newsprint In 2013, global newsprint demand

<<<

 fell by 5.1%, or 1.6 million tons, with all key regions declining. The decline was most severe in North America (9.5%) and Western Europe (5.8%), which together accounted for approximately 60% of the overall decline. In Asia, demand decreased

<<<

 by 1.7% due to a 7.5% decline in China. The decline in Western European demand for newsprint was driven by a 6.2% decline in paid-for circulation and a loss in pagination (the number of printed pages per printed work) of approximately 2.0%

<<<

 according to PPPC estimates. A 6.5% fall in the consumption of free daily newspapers also contributed to the decline, which was mainly due to the carry-over effect of circulation reductions that had already taken place in 2012. The only mitigating

<<<

 factor was a positive swing in consumer stocks, especially in Spain and Germany. Australasian newsprint saw a significant decline of 17.1% year-over-year due to strategic shifts by publishers in a region with high paper usage per capita compared

<<<

 to other mature markets. Through the first half of 2014, newsprint demand in Western Europe decreased only 2.7%, despite paid-for circulation decreasing by 5.5% and pagination remaining flat or slightly decreasing according to PPPC estimates

<<<

. The downgrading of improved newsprint (categorized in uncoated mechanical) to newsprint in Germany and France limited the decline in demand for regular newsprint grades year-to-date during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. There have

<<<

 also been some indications of stock-building in the big-five markets (Germany, UK, Italy, France and Spain) which help to explain the changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. In Australasia, the decrease in newsprint was lower

<<<

 than the previous three years at 6.1%.
Uncoated mechanical Global demand for uncoated mechanical papers declined at an average annual rate of 5.0% from 2008 to 2013. The decline in Western Europe in 2013 was only 1.6%, compared to a decline

<<<

 of 5.1% in the previous year. Global uncoated mechanical demand decreased by 2.8% year-to-date as of September 2014. In Sc mechanical, the decline year-to-date was highly concentrated in Western Europe (7.2%), partly driven by demand shifting

<<<

 to coated grades.
Coated mechanical Global demand for coated mechanical papers declined at an average annual rate of 4.4% from 2008 to 2013. In 2013, demand in Western Europe fell by 7.8%, but increased by 4.4% in Australasia. During the

 reduced in North America, Western Europe, Japan and other traditional markets.
Historical closures From 2008 to 2013, capacity in newsprint, uncoated mechanical and coated mechanical papers was reduced by a total of approximately seven million

Recently announced closures
A significant amount of closures have taken place or been announced over the past year. In Europe, for example, approximately

 600,000 tons of capacity reductions have taken place. Furthermore, in November 2014, UPM announced approximately 800,000 tons of additional capacity closures that are expected to take place in the first quarter of 2015. Similarly, in North

<<<

 America, approximately 1,300,000 tons of closures are expected to have occurred by the end of first quarter of 2015.

Newsprint
In 2013, Western European newsprint capacity decreased by 9.3%, with 790,000 tons removed from the market. The majority

<<<

 of the newsprint volume decline was the result of the closure of five paper machines, of which three were closed by Stora Enso. On an annual basis, the three closures removed a combined 655,000 tons of capacity. The Burgo Group and Holmen AB

<<<

 also carried out significant capacity reductions. In addition, some large changes in grade mix at several mills resulted in lower newsprint capacity. The recent announcement of closures by UPM is expected to further reduce newsprint capacity

Europe
In Europe, we remain among the top five producers in all grades in which we compete (measured in production capacity). In 2013, we were the

<<<

 fourth largest newsprint producer with 12.0% market share based on capacity, the fifth largest producer of coated mechanical paper with 8.0% market share and the fourth largest producer of uncoated mechanical paper with 8.0% market share (according

<<<

 to RISI data adjusted for recent closure announcements). North America remains a more consolidated market than Europe, except in relation to uncoated mechanical paper, which suggests that there is room for further consolidation in the publication

<<<

 paper markets.
Australasia
We are the sole newsprint producer in Australasia with an estimated 83% market share, based on our delivered volume and after taking imports into consideration. After the conversion of one of our two newsprint machines

<<<

 at the Boyer mill, which became fully operational in the second quarter of 2014, we also became the sole producer of coated mechanical paper in the region and expect to cover approximately 35% of demand by the end of 2014 (with the remainder

<<<

 being served by imports). We also supply approximately 150,000 tons of newsprint per annum to the broader Asian market through our trading partner, NorCell Asia.
Raw Materials and Other Key Inputs
Energy (including electricity)
Energy is a

<<<

 key input for the paper and packaging industry. In addition to providing energy to run paper machines, a significant amount of energy is used in the mechanical pulp process where wood is chipped in large grinders that are run by electronic

<<<

 motors. Steam is also used in the thermo-mechanical pulp process, which is generated from other processes that also require the use of energy.
Pulp
Pulp for paper making can be either mechanically or chemically produced. Mechanical pulp is

<<<

 manufactured by grinding wood usually at site using electricity and steam. Chemical pulp, which is often purchased on the open market, is manufactured using a chemical process where fibers are separated from lignin and other wood residuals

<<<

. The majority of our pulp is mechanical and is manufactured rather than purchased from the market.
Chemical pulp prices have followed an upward trend since the end of 2002. After steep declines in the price of chemical pulp from 2008 to 20

<<<

11, prices increased from 2012 to the first half of 2014. Because we use mostly mechanical pulp in our operations, and given recent closures of certain mills that used chemical pulp, our exposure to such price changes in minimal.
Recovered Paper

<<<


In addition to pulp, another important source of fiber for the paper industry is recovered paper. Recovered paper is primarily used in the production of newsprint, containerboard and paperboard as a cheaper alternate to virgin fiber. Two of

<<<

 the larger sources of recovered paper are recycled corrugated containers and newspapers. Recovered paper prices have remained largely stable since 2012, within a price range of 120 - 125 per ton.
Paper Grade and Other Definitions
Newsprint

<<<


Newsprint is low cost, short life-cycle paper that is mostly used to print daily and weekly newspapers and advertising inserts. It is designed for use on printing presses that employ a long web of paper rather than individual sheets. Newsprint

<<<

 is mainly used by publishers and printers due to its low cost relative to other paper grades. The demand for optical and printability properties is lower than for other printing and writing papers, and the main requirements are sufficient strength

<<<

 to run through modern high-speed web printing presses and the ability to accept four-color printing at qualities that meet the needs of typical newspaper advertisers. Newsprint is manufactured mainly from recycled fiber or mechanical pulp,

<<<

 but may also be manufactured from bleached chemical pulp.
98

Magazine papers Magazine paper is generally of higher quality than newsprint and can be either uncoated or coated. The specific grade of magazine paper chosen depends on the print

<<<

 quality needed (e.g. due to magazine appearance). Coated mechanical papers have a thin layer of coating on both sides that provides a glossy finish and have better printing properties and appearance. Generally, coated mechanical paper is used

<<<

 for magazines, brochures, catalogs, advertising materials and promotional products. Magazine papers are produced mainly from mechanical pulp and recycled fiber, but may also from bleached chemical pulp.

 Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and the neighboring islands), we operate two mills in Australia and one mill in New Zealand with 0.7 million tons of publication paper production capacity. We also operate Australasia's sole newsprint and

<<<

 magazine paper mills, making us a leading provider of publication paper in the region.
Our newsprint paper products include standard and improved grades, while our magazine paper products comprise uncoated super-calendared paper and light-weight

<<<

 coated paper. The end uses of our products are mainly newspapers and magazines, but also include catalogs, inserts/flyers, supplements, free-sheets, directories, direct mail and brochures. Our principal geographic markets for newsprint products

<<<

 are Europe and Australasia, while our main geographic markets for magazine paper products are Europe, Australasia and North America. We sell our products in these markets under well-known brands, including Nornews, Norbright, NorX, Norstar

<<<

, Norcote, Norsc, Norbook, Vantage and Tasman Directory. Our customers include publishers of leading periodicals in Europe, Australasia and the rest of the world, and we have long-standing relationships with many of our top tier publishing clients

<<<

.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we estimate that our market shares, based on deliveries for newsprint and magazine paper in Europe, were approximately 13% and 7%, respectively, and that our share of sales by volume for newsprint

<<<

 in Australasia was approximately 83%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, approximately 55% of our operating revenues from the sale of publication paper in Australasia were generated from customers with whom we have long-term contractual

<<<

 arrangements.
Over the last five years, as a result of a strategic refocus, we have streamlined our business through a broad range of operational initiatives and investments, which we believe have positioned our business to improve its profitability

<<<

 and cash flow generation.
Across our Group, we have implemented continuous cost-improvement initiatives, including headcount reductions and working capital management measures, to improve our cash flow. Such measures include the increased use

<<<

 of receivables financings as well as our recent investment in and completion of a thermo-mechanical pulp, or TMP facility at our Saugbrugs mill, which we expect to reduce electricity costs.
In Europe, we have improved our operating portfolio

<<<

, retaining our best assets while strategically reducing underperforming capacity. We sold our Follum and Parenco mills in 2012, and closed one paper machine at our Walsum mill in 2013. In Australasia, we have maintained revenue visibility and

<<<

 stability by amending and prolonging long-term contracts with the region's two largest consumers of publication paper, securing stable revenues for our future. At the same time, we have diversified our Australasian product mix through the addition

<<<

 of magazine paper production capacity at our Boyer mill, where we are now the region's sole magazine paper producer.
We expect our past investments, when coupled with our renewed focus on key customer geographies, in Europe, where our customers

<<<

 are concentrated in the region's four largest economies, and in Australasia, where we are the leading producer, will enable us to benefit from anticipated improvements in the market for our products. In particular, we believe we are well-positioned

<<<

 to benefit from any future declines in aggregate publication paper production capacity, any future increases in publication paper prices and any future improvements in publication paper mill utilization rates.
For the twelve months ended September

<<<

 30, 2014, we generated NOK 12,476 million (1,509 million) of consolidated operating revenue and NOK 910 million (110 million) of consolidated EBITDA. Our Publication Paper Europe segment, our Publication Paper Australasia segment and our Other

<<<

 Activities segment represented 67%, 37% and -4 % , respectively, of our total consolidated EBITDA for this period.

Competitive Strengths We believe that we benefit from the following competitive and credit strengths:

Strong market positions in Australasia and Europe
We are the sole producer of newsprint and magazine

<<<

 paper in Australasia, where we have a leading position in a concentrated newsprint and magazine paper market and compete only against imports. In Europe, we are the third largest producer of publication paper and we export products to North

<<<

 America, Asia and North Africa, which are our most important export destinations from Europe. Based on our global reach and our longstanding com m itm ent to and experience in the publication paper segment, we believe we are a preferred supplier

<<<

 in Australasia and Europe.

Diversified revenue base with strong visibility
We benefit from significant revenue diversification across geographies, paper grades and customers. We also benefit from long-term relationships with customers and

<<<

 high client retention rates. We believe that our customer base, which includes large top tier publishing groups with strong balance sheets, recognizes the importance of having a sustainable and reliable source of publication paper. This dynamic

<<<

 provides us with considerable recurring business and revenue visibility.
In Europe, we have long-standing and stable relationships with many of our customers, including relationships with most of our customers for more than five years and relationships

<<<

 with many customers for between 10 and 20 years. We believe that the creditworthiness of our custom er base is validated by

101

our ability to enter into significant factoring facilities in Norway, France and Austria. Our European customer

<<<

 contracts generally provide for quarterly adjustments of pricing.
In Australasia, we recently completed the conversion of one paper machine at our Boyer mill in Tasmania to enable the production of coated mechanical paper. This conversion has

<<<

 enabled us to diversify our regional product mix from newsprint. We are the sole local producer of newsprint and have integrated extensively with our customers' businesses, including, for example, through warehouse and inventory management

<<<

, integrated supply chain processes, local support and other logistics services. We have long-term contracts with our two largest customers maturing in 2020, which provide us with strong revenue visibility. In addition, we are well-integrated

<<<

 within our customers' value chain due to our provision of warehousing services for newsprint customers and other logistical services. We believe that this integration provides value-added services that make us a strong preferred supplier.
Efficient

<<<

 cost position
The combination of our cost competitive assets, the strategic location of our mills and a stable supply of energy and raw materials provides us with an efficient cost position.
E c o n o m ie s o f s c a le
We benefit from economies

<<<

 of scale in Europe, where the scale of our Saugbrugs, Skogn and Golbey mills enables us to have low production costs per ton. Our mills are well-positioned to reflect demand for the high value types of paper they produce. Our mix of newsprint

<<<

 and magazine production capabilities within our mills provides us with considerable operational synergies and flexibility. In addition, we have a long-standing continuous cost improvement program and have successfully reduced a number of our

<<<

 operating costs, streamlined our production processes and increased the efficiency of our mills.
E ffic ie n t p ro d u c t d is trib u tio n
The favorable location of our mills enables us to achieve low delivered costs in our markets. In Europe

<<<

, our mills are located adjacent to waterways or seaports and benefit from lower transportation costs of both inbound raw materials and outbound distribution of our finished products. In Australasia, we are the sole domestic newsprint and magazine

<<<

 paper producer, which provides us with a significant cost advantage over imports, and our mills are located in close proximity to the populated areas in the region.
S ta b le s u p p ly s o u rc in g
Our long-term contracts for energy and favorable

<<<

 sources of wood provide us with stable sources of supply for our most significant energy and raw material requirements. Most of our electricity requirements, our single largest expense item, are purchased under long-term contracts. We have

<<<

 long-term contracts in place that cover substantially all of the electricity requirements for our mills in Norway, and a significant portion of the electricity requirements for our other European operations. Our Australian and New Zealand mills

<<<

 likewise have long-term electricity contracts in place, and our Tasman mill also operates a geothermal energy plant that we commissioned in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, we have long-term contracts for supplies of wood to our Australasian

<<<

 operations and we have long-standing relationships with suppliers in Norway, as we are the country's largest buyer of pulp wood. The relative stability provided by our effective supply contracting and our relationships with reliable suppliers

<<<

 permits strong visibility in relation to costs and shields our operations from electricity and fiber cost fluctuations.
Proven track record of operational streamlining and delivery on current initiatives
We have responded to long-term structural

<<<

 decreases in demand with the closure of several of our machines and mills, such as our Union and Follum mills in Norway and our Steti mill in the Czech Republic, between 2006 and 2012. In 2013, we closed one of the two machines at our Tasman

<<<

 mill in New Zealand and one of the two machines at our Walsum mill in Germany. In total, we have reduced production capacity by more than 50% since December 31,2005, from 6.9 million tons to 3.0 million tons as of September 30, 2014. These

<<<

 actions have significantly reduced our cost base. We have also reduced our fixed costs through headcount reductions and have increased our capital efficiency through the disposal of non-core assets, certain less competitive operations and mills

<<<

 outside of our core geographical regions of Europe and Australasia. These include two mills in South Korea, two mills in China, one mill in Brazil, one mill in Chile, one mill in the Netherlands and one mill in Thailand.
102

In response to

<<<

 structural changes in demand and in order to seize a market opportunity within magazine paper, we have also converted production capacity from newsprint to magazine paper. Following a NOK 500 million (60 million) investment, our Boyer mill

<<<

 in Australia now produces coated mechanical paper on one converted machine, making it the sole domestic magazine paper producer in Australasia. Our ability to switch production has enabled us to better adapt to changes in demand between different

<<<

 paper products by reducing production capacity for products that have experienced reduced demand, and by increasing production capacity for products with increased demand. In addition, we have invested more than NOK 200 million (25 million

<<<

) in a TMP plant at our Saugbrugs mill, resulting in significant reduction of energy consumption in our fiber production at that mill, which has also enabled us to expand our product portfolio to new uncoated mechanical segments.
We continue

<<<

 to focus on the implementation of a variety of improvement initiatives and the identification of new sources of efficiency. We achieved total cost reductions of NOK 351 million (45 million) during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Some

<<<

 of our most successful ongoing improvement initiatives include operational and logistical enhancements at our Saugbrugs, Golbey and Albury mills as a result of reduced usage of chemicals and improved energy balance.
Attractive free cash flow

<<<

 generation
Over the past four years, we have continued to maintain strong cash flows prior to reflecting our debt service payments despite industry revenue declines. We have been able to bolster our cash flow generation by reducing our fixed

<<<

 cost base, improving our management of working capital and selectively selling assets.
Our strong focus on working capital management has resulted in an efficient and industry-leading working capital management system, as reflected by our reduced

<<<

 inventories and improved control of accounts receivable. We have reduced our working capital positions from NOK 2,094 million (270 million) as of December 31, 2011 to NOK 769 million (92 million) as of December 31, 2013.
We believe that we

<<<

 have completed our major development capital expenditures and do not anticipate any substantial development investment programs in the near to medium-term. In recent years, maintenance capital expenditure requirements at our eight mills have

<<<

 remained relatively low and manageable, with capital expenditures of NOK 150 million (20 million) and NOK 151 million (19 million) for the years ended December 31,2012 and 2013, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we

<<<

 spent NOK 112 million (14 million) on maintenance capital expenditures. In addition, we have completed various one-time restructuring initiatives that negatively impacted our cash flows in recent years.
The combination of our ongoing cost reduction

<<<

 initiatives, efficient management of working capital and the sale of certain assets has contributed to our strong free cash flow generation. In particular, cash conversion, which is defined as EBITDA less changes in working capital and gross

<<<

 capital expenditures divided by EBITDA, was 44%, 98% and 58% for the years ended December 31,2011,2012 and 2013, respectively, and 80% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. Furthermore, we believe the completion of our development

<<<

 capital expenditures and one-time restructuring programs will position us to benefit from attractive cash flow conversion going forward. Excluding development capital expenditures, such as investments in our Boyer and Tasman mills, our cash

<<<

 conversion for the years ended December 31,2011,2012 and 2013 would have been 52%, 120% and 103%, respectively, and 102% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
Strong collateral
The Senior Secured Notes benefit from robust credit support

<<<

, which include senior Guarantees from our primary subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors), the parent companies of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the Parent Guarantors) and Security Interests over our principal revenue generating assets

<<<

 or security over the shares in the entities that own such revenue generating assets. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Guarantors generated 108% of the Group's consolidated EBITDA, and as of December 31,2014, held 89% of the Group's

<<<

 total assets, defined as total assets from all Group entities minus intercompany receivables and intercompany shares. Senior Secured Noteholders received share pledges over the issued share capital of each of Norske Treindustrier AS, the Exchange

<<<

 Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors, Norske Skog Walsum GmbH and Lysaker Invest AS. In addition, subject to the exclusion of certain assets and subject to certain prior-ranking security interests in accordance

<<<

 with the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes are
103

secured by Security Interests to be granted under a general security deed (the equivalent of a fixed and floating charge) over the assets held by the Australian Guarantors

<<<

 and the New Zealand Guarantor which, for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, generated 33.1% of the Group's consolidated EBITDA, and as of September 30, 2014, held 34.3% of the Group's total assets. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 are secured by all intercompany loans and receivables (excluding receivables relating to the Parent Guarantor's cash pooling arrangements) owed to the Parent Guarantors or any Excluded Entity by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or by the restricted

<<<

 subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.
Execution-focused management team with relevant experience
We believe that our senior management team has the relevant experience to execute our strategy. Each of our regional management teams

<<<

 has an average tenure of 15 years at the Parent. We believe that we benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our senior corporate management team and the production know-how of the respective mill management teams, who have relevant

<<<

 experience in the global publication paper industry. In addition to experience in the publication paper industry globally, our corporate management team also has management experience from other commodities businesses. We maintain a flat and

<<<

 lean decentralized decision-making structure, which allows our local management teams to manage their day-to-day operations based on local market dynamics.
Strategy
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Defend our leading position

<<<

 in the publication paper industry in Europe and Australasia
With a leading position in both newsprint and magazine paper in Europe and Australasia, we are well-positioned to leverage our existing customer relationships. We believe we are a

<<<

 stable supplier of newsprint in Europe where we sell our products to some of the region's leading paper consumers, including financial printing operations, drop advertisement producers such as Bertelsmann Group (MOHN Media Mohndruck GmbH),

<<<

 Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG and Carrefour Procurement International and major news publishers such as News International Ltd. in the United Kingdom, RCS Media Group SpA in Italy, Axel Springer SE in Germany and Schibsted Trykk Oslo AS in Norway

<<<

. We are the sole producer of publication paper in Australia and New Zealand and we are working to diversify our revenues. We aim to be the producer of choice for quality newsprint and magazine paper products in the European and Australasian

<<<

 markets, while maintaining and improving our position as a high-quality producer with a competitive cost base.
Continue proactive capacity management
We will continue to manage our production capacity in order to adjust to market developments

<<<

 proactively. In Europe, we have strategically reduced or converted capacity over the past three years, including, for example, our Follum and Parenco operations, to increase the operating margins of our continuing business. We will continue

<<<

 to monitor our asset base and market developments and consider measures to address our less competitive capacity. In Australasia, in line with the closure of one machine at our Tasman mill in 2013 and the conversion of one of our two newsprint

<<<

 machines at the Boyer mill in Australia to magazine paper production in 2014, we will continue our business system optimization in order to produce products where it is most cost-effective to do so.
Continue to strengthen business model
We

<<<

 will continue to invest in improvements to reduce costs and improve efficiency and quality. In Europe, we plan to invest in higher quality grades of newsprint products and focus on the extension of our product portfolio into selected new end

<<<

 use segments within publication paper as well as improve production mix quality at our Skogn mill. In Australasia, we are benefiting from our recent diversification to magazine paper production and we will leverage our new cost competitive

<<<

 position in magazine paper and our well-developed logistical system to serve export markets for newsprint.
Address capital structure and achieve stability
We intend to use the proceeds from the Offering to address a portion of our immediate

<<<

 and medium-term debt maturities through the implementation of the Proposed Exchange Offers. We will strive to reduce
104

leverage in the medium-term to achieve a long-term sustainable capital structure. By reducing the amount of operational

<<<

 earnings committed to debt repayment obligations, we hope to achieve greater operational stability that will provide a basis for future sustained profitability.
Carefully evaluate future consolidation opportunities We believe our industry needs

<<<

 to continue to better align capacity with demand, which we anticipate will be realized by industry consolidation in Europe. We will continue to evaluate selective opportunities to enhance our strategic and cost positions. However, any potential

<<<

 transaction will be structured with a focus on credit enhancement via careful evaluation of appropriate financing sources and terms.
Our History and Development We were founded in 1962 by the Norwegian forest owners' association in cooperation

<<<

 with private and public interests. In 1966, we commenced production of newsprint at our first paper machine, a fully integrated newsprint mill located in Skogn in Norway and, by 1989, after a period of industry consolidation, we became the

<<<

 sole Norwegian publication paper producer. During the 1990s, we began to expand our operations outside Norway and in other parts of Europe. Since 1999, through various acquisitions, we have become a global publication paper company. While expanding

<<<

 our operations, we also refocused them, selling off operating units involved in manufacturing other paper grades, chemical pulp and building materials to concentrate on our core area of publication papers. In more recent periods, in order to

<<<

 maintain sustainable prices for our products affected by industry-wide excess capacity, as well as reduce our operating costs, we have selectively reduced capacity through shutdowns and divesting certain assets. From 2006 to date, we engaged

<<<

 in several reorganizations in order to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet. We shut down or sold several of our mills, particularly in Asia, to address severely underperforming assets where we saw little potential. In 2012 and 201

<<<

3, we sold our Parenco mill in the Netherlands and our mills in Brazil and Thailand and closed down one machine at the Walsum mill. In addition, our share in the sales offices of Norske Skog Czech & Slovak Republic spol.s r.o (Czech Republic

<<<

) and Norske Skog Polska Sp.z o.o. (Poland) were sold in June 2014.
Reinvestment Projects In the first half of 2014, we completed significant reinvestment projects at two of our facilities. At our Saugbrugs site in Norway we upgraded our onsite

<<<

 pulping equipment and invested in a new TMP plant, which will reduce the consumption of energy and chemical pulp at that mill. As a result, we have streamlined our operations at Saugbrugs, which we believe will result in decreased operational

<<<

 expenses and reduced recurring fixed costs. The modernization will also allow for reduced property taxes and improved staffing. In Australasia, our Boyer mill conversion was completed in the first half of 2014 after we converted one of our

<<<

 newsprint machines to magazine paper production. We believe the conversion of one of our two newsprint machines to magazine paper production at the facility will ultimately result in higher margins going forward.
Our Products and Operations

<<<

 Publication paper We are a fully focused manufacturer of publication paper. Our product range consists of newsprint and magazine paper. We produce newsprint in standard and improved grades, for use in daily and free newspapers, inserts, directories

<<<

 and advertising supplements. We also produce two different types of magazine paper: uncoated super-calendared paper, or SC, and light-weight coated paper, or Lw C. Our magazine-grade paper is used primarily for commercial printing, magazines

<<<

, advertising, direct mail, inserts, flyers and catalogs.

We produce magazine paper in our four wholly-owned mills in Norway, Austria, Germany, and since 2014, in Australia as the sole domestic producer.

Publication Paper Europe
Publication Paper Europe accounted for 75% of our operating revenue

<<<

, 74% of our gross operating earnings and 76% of our total production capacity for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
In Europe, we have a total of five wholly-owned mills producing publication paper in Norway, France, Austria and Germany

<<<

 with a combined production capacity of 2,290,000 tons as of September 30, 2014, making us the third largest producer of publication paper in Europe by capacity. Newsprint and magazine production capacity in 2014 from our European mills totalled

<<<

 1,300,000 tons and 990,000 tons, respectively.

R a w m ate ria ls
The principal raw materials we use in newsprint paper production are pulp made from wood or recovered paper from recycled newspapers and magazines. For magazine paper, we also

<<<

 use chemical pulp and coating chemicals, in addition to the pulp from wood. In Norway, we purchase wood mainly through annual contracts for both price and volume. For our Golbey, Bruck and Walsum mills, we obtain wood from a number of local

<<<

 suppliers with contract durations ranging from three months to one year, with a set price for the relevant period. The wood for Golbey and Walsum is sourced through a joint

107

venture purchasing company, Sapin, in which we and Sappi Limited

<<<

 each own a 50% share. The wood for Bruck is also sourced through a joint venture purchasing company, Papierholz Austria, in which we own a 7.5% share along with Sappi Austria (42.5%), Mondi Frantschach (25%) and Heinzel-Group Zellstoff Pols

<<<

 (25%).
Similarly, our recovered paper supplies are mainly sourced locally by the relevant mill. Our recovered paper supplies for the Golbey mill are sourced locally by the mill, both through direct agreement with communities and local collectors

<<<

 and national trading companies. Recovered paper for our Bruck mill is sourced through both a 100% owned company, Norske Skog Papier Recycling, and a joint venture purchasing company, Austria Papier Recycling GmbH, which is owned by us and two

<<<

 other Austrian mills, UPM Kymmene Austria and Laakirchen Paper, which is 100% owned by the Heinzl Group. For our Skogn mill in Norway, recovered paper is also primarily sourced locally in the same way, but supplemented with some imports from

<<<

 the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Purchase agreements for recovered paper for volume and price varies from monthly to one year, with a mix of fixed pricing and variable pricing adjusted with reference to market prices.
Chemical pulp for

<<<

 magazine production at our Saugbrugs, Bruck and Walsum mills is sourced both through a common group contract and by local suppliers. The contracts vary from one to three years and provide for monthly price adjustment, linked to the European

<<<

 reference prices for chemical pulp.
S ales a n d d is trib u tio n
We sell publication paper to a large number of established and creditworthy customers, ranging from commercial printers and corporations such as Bertelsmann Group (Mohn Druck

<<<

), Lidl and Carrefour, to publishers such as News International Ltd. in the United Kingdom, RCS Quotidiani SpA in Italy, Axel Springer AG in Germany and Schibsted in Norway.
The majority of our publication paper production is sold under fixed

<<<

 price contracts that include both fixed volume sales and sales as a percentage of our customers' requirements. Prior to 2011, our newsprint contracts were typically longer than the quarterly magazine contracts, with a term of one year and with

<<<

 pricing fixed at the beginning of the term for the entire year. However, beginning in 2011, we have negotiated mainly three month contracts with European newsprint customers, with subsequent quarterly price re-negotiations.
Our publication

<<<

 paper operations sell their products directly to our customers through a sales force based in the main European markets. Newsprint exports from our European operations are sold by our Oslo-based export department through sales agents and distributors

<<<

 outside of Europe. Export volumes contributed approximately 10% of total European newsprint sales as of September 30, 2014, with the main markets being Egypt, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, India and North Africa. Exports from our European

<<<

 magazine operations, which contributed approximately 25% of total European magazine sales as of September 30, 2014, are also sold by sales agents and distributors outside of Europe. Key export markets are, among others, the United States, Mexico

<<<

 and South Africa.
The European sales operation is organized around five sales hubs: London, Paris, Oslo, Augsburg and Milan. Each hub is responsible for sales activities in specified markets and consists of both order fulfilment teams and sales

<<<

 professionals. Sales opportunities are referred to product management professionals at the relevant mill that would fulfil the order, who then contract directly with the customer. All sales hubs handle both newsprint and magazine sales.
We

<<<

 have implemented customer service applications in order to integrate our products and operations into our customers' operations. In Europe, we provide administrative services including electronic on demand shipping, customs document transfer

<<<

 and tax notification, print program management for our retail customers and integrated marketing efforts. We also provide technical advice, instructing our clients on how to optimize their use of our products through different printing methods

<<<

 and equipment.
C o m pe titio n
The market for publication paper in Europe is highly competitive. According to PPPC, we currently provide 13% of newsprint, 6% of coated mechanical paper and 7% of uncoated mechanical paper capacity in Europe

<<<

. Our principal competitors in Europe include UPM Kymmene Corporation, Stora Enso Oyj, Holmen AB, Cartiere Burgo SpA. Newsprint and magazine paper are generally subject to the same supply and demand trends, although newsprint is still approximately

<<<

 80% consumed by newspapers and printed in cold set. However, a growing share of newsprint is being printed in heat set
108

for free standing advertising. Magazine paper is more exposed to advertising trends and printed in a variety of printing

<<<

 methods. Advertising content typically comprises a larger proportion of magazine publications than newspapers and magazine paper has a larger share going to direct commercial usage, such as door drop. Depending on the capacity utilization of

<<<

 the production facilities of North American paper companies, as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar, our newsprint products sold in Europe also compete with exports to Europe from North America, where our primary competitor is Resolute

<<<

 Forest Products. North American market share (by volume) of the newsprint market in Europe has declined from approximately 7% in 2000 to approximately 2.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

 Paper Australasia accounted for 25% of our operating revenue, 32% of our gross operating earnings and 24% of our total production capacity as of the nine months ended September 30, 2014. We have three mills in Australasia, two in Australia

<<<

 and one in New Zealand, with a total production capacity of 715,000 tons. Each of the three mills has one newsprint machine, contributing to a total regional newsprint capacity of 575,000 tons (or 19% of our total production capacity). As of

<<<

 April 1,2014, after the conversion of one paper machine at our Boyer mill from newsprint to coated mechanical, we had 140,000 tons of magazine paper capacity in the region (or 19.6% of our total production capacity in the region).

R a w m ate ria ls
The majority of the raw material needed for our operations in Australasia is procured under medium- and long-term contracts, with expiry as late as 2023, depending on location and type

<<<

 of material supplied. Materials required vary from mill to mill as further described below. A lb u ry : Albury is currently the only newsprint mill to utilize recovered paper within the Australasian region. It consumes approximately 100,00

<<<

0 tons of recycled paper, of which about 35% is publishers' waste, with the balance purchased on the spot market. Approximately 415,000 cubic meters of wood are also used at Albury, with 80% being supplied under medium-term contracts (with expiry

<<<

 dates ranging up to 2018). The balance of Albury's wood needs is purchased on the spot market. B o y e r: Boyer owns and manages 20,000 hectares of forest assets that supply the majority (approximately 65%) of its total wood fiber requirements

<<<

. The balance of its wood fiber requirements are purchased under long-term supply contracts with expiry ranging from 2015 to 2022. Approximately 560,000 cubic meters of wood are used at Boyer. The Boyer mill purchases its main coating chemicals

<<<

 for the production of magazine paper from a supplier that recently built a new chemical plant at our mill site, in connection with the start-up of our magazine production in 2014. T asm a n: Tasman benefits from relatively low cost wood fiber

Sales and distribution

<<<


Our operations in Australasia generally sell their newsprint products to newspaper publishers and commercial printers of preprint advertising, whose products are inserted into newspapers or delivered by other means. The principal markets for

<<<

 our Australasian newsprint are Australia and New Zealand, with approximately 30% of our Australasian production exported to the Pacific Islands and other Asian markets. Our magazine products from Boyer are generally sold to major catalogue

<<<

, insert and flyer printers, more than 85% of which are delivered in Australia.
Our publication paper in Australia and New Zealand is sold directly to our customers by our Australasian sales force. With effect from the second half of 2013, we

<<<

 entered into new contracts with durations of seven years with our two largest customers, News Limited and Fairfax Media Limited. Both long-term contracts provide for annual price adjustment in the first two to five years, while the remaining

<<<

 period is determined with reference to U.S. dollar pricing of the relevant publication paper product. In 2014, approximately 55% of our Australasian deliveries were covered by these long-term newsprint agreements. The magazine contracts are

<<<

 mainly negotiated every three months with the Australian catalogue and advertising customers.

 account for nearly 37% of the coated mechanical paper market in the region based on sales volume. We face competition from companies that import paper, mainly from newsprint producers in Korea and Indonesia and magazine producers in Japan and

<<<

 Europe. Given the structure of the Australian publishing market, with few, large players, the ability of any one supplier to dictate pricing is more limited than would otherwise be the case in the face of relatively limited supply.

Our Saugbrugs mill in Norway produces super-calendared magazine paper and has three paper machines. Total production

<<<

 capacity and utilization at our Saugbrugs mill were 530,000 tons and 86%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 457,000 tons. Our Saugbrugs mill has a long-term power contract until 2020 for

<<<

 delivery of 1.01 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover approximately 91% of its expected annual energy consumption. The machines at our Saugbrugs mill use internally produced mechanical pulp and purchased chemical pulp in

<<<

 the manufacturing process. In 2013 and 2014, we invested in a new TMP plant, which improves the consumption of energy and chemical pulp at the Saugbrugs mill. As of June 30, 2014, the new TMP plant was fully operating at the projected efficiency

 level.
S kogn o pe ra tion s
Our Skogn mill is the largest of our two plants located in Norway by production capacity and has three paper machines. Commissioned in 1966, its total production capacity and utilization were 565,000 tons and 8

<<<

4%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 476,000 tons of newsprint. Located on the coast in Central Norway, it is well-positioned for deliveries by ocean freight, and in 2013, exported 75

<<<

% of its production volume, of which more than two-thirds went to the United Kingdom. The mill benefits from a stable supply of wood fiber and has long-term power

112

contracts until 2023 for delivery of 0.8 TWh of electricity annually, which

<<<

 is sufficient to cover approximately 70% of its expected annual energy consumption. According to RISI, as of December 31, 2012, Skogn's position on the manufacturing cash cost curve for newsprint (assuming Frankfurt delivery) ranked it among

<<<

 the lowest in Europe.
G o lb e y o pe ra tion s
Our Golbey mill, which we began operating in 1992, represented our first business outside of Norway. Its main product is standard newsprint with total production capacity and utilization of 6

<<<

15,000 tons and 95%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 582,000 tons. Golbey's machines are the newest and most productive of our mills. This productivity, along with sourcing agreements

<<<

 with local communities for recovered paper and sawmill partners for wood, has enabled Golbey to attain a leading cost position. According to RISI, as of December 31,2012, Golbey's manufacturing cash costs for newsprint was ranked among the

<<<

 lowest of European newsprint producers. Our Golbey mill, together with other members of an industrial consortium established by the top 30 French industrial energy consumers , has long-term power contracts for delivery of 0.36 TWh of electricity

<<<

 annually until 2030, which is sufficient to cover approximately one-third of the expected annual energy consumption of the mill. The remaining energy demand of Golbey is covered by energy purchases via a French regulated tariff structure called

<<<

 ARENH.
B ru c k o pe ra tion s
Our Bruck mill, which we acquired in 1996, was commissioned in 1953 and produces standard newsprint, using primarily mechanical pulp and recycled fiber. Its newsprint production capacity and utilization were 

<<<

120,000 tons and 100%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 120,000 tons of newsprint. Bruck is served by its own power plant and can generate approximately 0.4 TWh of electricity, which is

<<<

 sufficient for its expected annual energy consumption. In addition to newsprint, Bruck also produces light-weight coated mechanical paper on a paper machine commissioned in 1989, which uses mechanical pulp produced from wood and recycled fiber

<<<

 and purchased chemical pulp in the manufacturing process. Its total magazine paper production capacity and utilization were 260,000 tons and 87%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, with an actual production of 22

<<<

6,000 tons of light-weight coated. However, following the closure of one machine at Walsum at the end of 2013, the production at Bruck's magazine machine has been increased to almost its full capacity. Bruck benefits from low cost on-machine

<<<

 coating technology and, according to RISI, Bruck's cash manufacturing costs (assuming Frankfurt delivery) for magazine paper was ranked among the lowest in Europe as of December 31, 2012.
W alsum o p e ra tio n s
Our Walsum mill, which is located

<<<

 in Germany, produces light-weight coated mechanical paper and has one paper machine, which uses mechanical pulp and purchased chemical pulp in the manufacturing process. The mill's total production capacity and utilization were 200,000 tons

<<<

 and 99%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, after the permanent closure of one paper machine. The mill's favorable location on the Rhine River provides easy access to raw materials and sea freight. The mill consumes

<<<

 approximately 0.4 TWh of electricity annually, which is purchased from the market on a spot basis or pursuant to short-term contracts.
Australasia We have three publication paper mills in Australasia, which had a combined annual production

Albury operations
Our Albury mill is the youngest mill in the Australasian segment. Its single machine

<<<

 was commissioned in 1981 and produces standard newsprint. The mill underwent a significant rebuild in 2006, which included the addition of a shoe press. Total production capacity and utilization at our Albury mill were 270,000 tons and 91%

<<<

, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 246,000 tons of newsprint. Our Albury mill has a long-term power contract until 2022 for delivery of approximately 0.7 TWh of electricity annually, which

<<<

 is sufficient to cover all of its expected annual energy consumption. In addition, our Albury mill purchases gas to produce steam under a contract terminating in 2016. Prior to the termination of this contract, another gas supply agreement

<<<

 will need to be finalized, and preparations are being made for its negotiation. It is expected that any new gas supply arrangement will come at a greater cost than current arrangements. Gas prices in the eastern Australian market are rising

<<<

 and moving away from the domestic price of gas towards the international market price of gas (which has, in the past, been much higher than the domestic price paid). Albury benefits from a favorable location with low distribution costs to the

<<<

 major Australian metropolitan regions of Melbourne and Sydney. Albury produces newsprint using both wood and recycled fiber. Almost 90% of the mill's consumption of wood is supplied by medium-term contracts with terms varying from 2015 to 

<<<

2018, 35% of the recycled paper is sourced directly from publishers' waste.

Boyer operations
Our Boyer mill was the first mill in our Australasian segment to commence newsprint production. It has two machines, one producing standard and

<<<

 improved newsprint, and one producing LWC magazine paper, using principally wood fiber, the majority of which we source from our own self-managed forests. The first machine, PM2, was commissioned in 1952 and rebuilt in 1991, and during the

<<<

 first quarter of 2014, was converted from newsprint to LWC production. The second machine, PM3, commenced production in 1969 and was rebuilt in 1989 and 1996. Boyer's total production capacity is 150,000 tons of newsprint and 140,000 tons of

<<<

 LWC. In order to achieve the conversion of the PM2 newsprint machine, we had to shut down the machine during the first quarter of 2014. Production of LWC was ramped up during the second quarter of 2014, resulting in a production loss of around

<<<

 40,000 tons. The PM2 machine started up again in the first half of 2014 and the production of LWC is now running at full capacity. The utilization rate for the newsprint machine was 86% for the year ended December 31,2013. Our Boyer mill has

<<<

 a long-term power contract until 2020 for delivery of approximately 0.8 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover all of its expected annual energy consumption. The gas needed for drying the LWC paper is sourced through a long

<<<

-term contract to late 2018.

Tasm an o pe ra tion s
Our Tasman mill, located in New Zealand, has one paper machine that produces standard and improved newsprint grades using principally wood fiber. The machine, PM3, was rebuilt in 2006. Its

<<<

 total production capacity and utilization were 155,000 tons and 95%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 148,000 tons of newsprint. Our Tasman mill has a long-term power contract until 

<<<

2023 for delivery of 0.64 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover the annual energy consumption. In January 2013, our Tasman mill commissioned a NZD 43 million investment for the construction of a geothermal power plant to

<<<

 provide an additional source of energy for the mill. The geothermal energy plant is operated by the mill, producing and selling energy both to the mill and to the grid.

Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used to manufacture our products

<<<

 are energy, wood, recovered paper, chemicals and inorganic fillers and chemical pulp. The prices of these raw materials are subject to commodity price fluctuations. Due to competitive pressures and the fixed-price nature of our customer contracts

<<<

, the prices of our products are not always correlated with increases and decreases in the cost of raw materials. See ` `R is k F a c to r s -- R is k s R e la te d to O u r B u s in e s s a n d O u r In d u s tr y -- P r ic e s f o r o u r

Energy
Energy constitutes our largest operating expense, and we are focused on reducing

<<<

 energy consumption. Energy accounted for 21% of our total operating expenses as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Of the amount spent on energy, 53% was related to electricity expenses. Approximately 85% of our electricity

<<<

 consumption is purchased under long-term contracts for fixed volumes and price expiring in 2020, which were entered into in Norway, France, Australia and New Zealand. We are constantly working on different energy saving programs, including

<<<

 optimization of steam supply, whereby less steam is used for making electricity when the price of purchasing electricity is low. This strategy also reduces the use of natural gas and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment. Several of our

<<<

 business units have also changed their operational patterns to exploit 24-hour fluctuations in electricity prices. In addition to reducing our energy consumption, we have reduced our exposure to fluctuations in energy prices by entering into

<<<

 long-term supply contracts. See

In Norway, long-term contracts with fixed volumes and price expiring in 2020 cover most of the energy consumption of our Skogn and Saugbrugs mills.

<<<

 Along with other members of an industrial consortium, we signed a long-term electricity contract in 2010, which expires in 2030, covering about one-third of Golbey's energy consumption. The remaining energy demand of Golbey is covered by energy

<<<

 purchases via a French regulated tariff structure called ARENH. Our operation in Bruck in Austria owns a natural gas-fired co-generation plant, which gives us an arbitrage opportunity between gas and electricity prices. Our operations in Germany

<<<

 are set up in a way that enables us to take advantage of the sometimes large spread between day and night electricity prices. Our exposure to spot prices in electricity and gas is mainly in continental Europe.
A u strala sia
Our operations

<<<

 in Australasia source most of their energy needs by purchasing electricity from third parties, with most energy consumption covered by long-term contracts. Each of our mills in Australasia purchases electricity through long-term contracts with

<<<

 fixed volumes and price, which expire between 2020 and 2023. In addition, our Albury mill purchases gas to produce steam under contract until 2016, and the gas needed for drying the LWC paper at the Boyer mill is sourced through a long-term

<<<

 contract to late 2018. Our Tasman operations also operate a geothermal energy plant commissioned in January 2013.
Wood
Wood purchases for our mills accounted for 13% of our total operating expenses as of and for the nine months ended September

<<<

 30, 2014. Total wood consumption by our wholly-owned mills for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 4.2 million cubic meters at a total cost of NOK 1,610 million. We purchase our wood in Australia pursuant to long-term contracts with fixed

<<<

 volumes and price expiring in 2020. At our Boyer mill, approximately 69% of its forest supply is derived from its 20,000 hectares of forest assets. In Norway and continental Europe, wood is purchased pursuant to short- and medium-term contracts

<<<

. In every country where we source wood, the area of land under forest is increasing.
Recovered paper
Recovered paper is an important fiber source for us. As of September 30, 2014, purchases of recovered paper accounted for 9% of our total operating

<<<

 expenses. In the year ended December 30, 2013, we consumed 1.1 million tons, of which 0.85 million tons was consumed in Europe. We purchase our recovered paper through short- to medium-term contracts, mostly from local producers. Their prices

<<<

 for recovered paper, which are largely driven by strong demand from China, has been stable in both 2013 and 2014.
Chemical pulp
As of September 30, 2014, purchases of chemical pulp accounted for 4% of our total operating expenses. Consumption

<<<

 of chemical pulp, which is used primarily in the production of magazine paper,
116

was approximately 140,000 tons in 2013. In Europe, chemical pulp for magazine production is sourced both through a common group contract and by local suppliers

<<<

 at Bruck and Walsum. The contract pricing is subject to a monthly adjustment with reference to a third-party reference price. The price for chemical pulp increased in 2013 and 2014, largely as a result of strong demand in China.
Transportation

<<<


Raw materials
Recycled fiber is a globally traded commodity, but environmental considerations apply when we are purchasing this material. Trucks are the predominant method we use for transporting raw materials to our mills, representing approximately

<<<

 78% of inward transport in 2013. Ship and train deliveries of raw materials to our mills accounted for 14% and 8%, respectively, of inward transport in 2013.
Finished products
We typically transport our products by various means, including

<<<

 by sea, truck and rail. We ship products from our Norwegian mills primarily using coastline ports that are equipped with modern deep sea docks. Products from our other European mills are transported and distributed on the European continent

<<<

 primarily by truck and by rail. Paper produced by our operations in Australasia is mostly sold in the country in which it is produced and is generally transported by ship, truck and rail. The volume exported to Asia is transported by ship.

<<<


For the year ended December 31,2013, 41% of our finished products (by volume) were transported to customers via trucks, while ship and rail transport represented 35% and 24%, respectively, of outward transport.
Health and Safety
Health and

<<<

 safety is the responsibility of the management at the Parent level and, ultimately, of the Chief Executive Officer, but the health and safety results of all units is monitored by our head office. All near-misses and injuries are reported via

<<<

 a group-wide follow up system, and experiences from each individual incident are shared throughout the organization. We conduct training and educational programs to improve health and safety conditions and reduce the frequency of workplace

<<<

 accidents. Most of our mills observe a strictly non-smoking policy and we implemented a standardized protection equipment program in 2014. Absence due to illness in the group in 2013 was 3.6%. Boyer, the regional office in Sydney, Tasman, Skogn

<<<

, Golbey and our head office reported zero lost-time injuries in 2013.
We must comply with a number of law and regulations regarding health and safety in the countries in which we operate. In Norway, the most important law concerning health

<<<

 and safety is the Norwegian Employment Act, which imposes a duty on us to provide a safe and secure working environment. We have policies and procedures in place to facilitate compliance with our obligation to protect the health and safety

<<<

 of our employees in all of our operations in Norway, which includes consultation with employee representatives, the appointment of local HES&Q Managers and personal safety representatives in each of our operating locations, and the establishment

<<<

 of a working environment committee with particular duties and authorities in relation to health, security and the working environment within our operations. The Labour Inspection Authority enforces safety and environmental standards in workplaces

<<<

 in Norway, and the Norwegian Employment Act includes a whistle-blowing procedure, which provides employees the right to notify certain supervisory authorities or other public authorities in relation to any breaches of health and safety requirements

<<<

. Corresponding laws and regulations apply to the business units in the other countries in which we operate.
Environment
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time

<<<

. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among other things, water use, air emissions, wood procurement, use of recycled materials, energy sources, the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous

<<<

 materials, the operation of our mills (including the noise impact of our operations), the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species, and the remediation of environmental contamination. Our operations require us

<<<

 to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenge. Compliance with such laws and regulations at
117

an international

<<<

, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.
Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, standards

<<<

 adopted by regulatory agencies and our permits and licenses, each of which is subject to periodic and increasingly stringent modifications and requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial

<<<

 civil and criminal fines, penalties, and possibly orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses.
As

<<<

 a result of the global geographic footprint of our mills, our production operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Further, as we principally operate in developed countries, such laws and regulations, compliance

<<<

 monitoring and enforcement are often stringent. We face the most rigorous environmental regulation in Europe and we aim for all our consolidated mills worldwide to operate in accordance with standards defined by the European Union.
The Industrial

<<<

 Emissions Directive 2010/75EU lays down rules on integrated prevention and control of pollution arising from industrial activities and the use of best available techniques (``BAT'') is a basic requirement of this directive. The EU Commission

 management, waste water and emissions to water, energy consumption and efficiency. The national laws in the European countries in which we operate regulate waste disposal and place restrictions on land filling materials, which establish a preference

<<<

 for waste management methods of prevention, reuse and recycling. In Norway, Austria and Germany, only inert ash and slag from thermal recycling and incineration may be placed in landfill sites.
In addition, we are also subject to Regulation

<<<

 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 18, 2006 concerning the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals, which, although not directly applicable to pulp and paper, applies to a number

<<<

 of raw materials that we source and to certain intermediate substances in the pulp production processes. Under the EU Timber Regulation 995/2010 (``EUTR'') we are required to conduct due diligence in relation to our suppliers when placing timer

<<<

 or timber products on the EU market for the first time. Additionally, the EUTR requires economic operators in the sector to maintain supplier and customer records in order to facilitate tracing and transparency throughout the supply chain.

<<<

 The countries in which we own production facilities have all ratified the Kyoto Protocol relating to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and we are subject to the national laws, which implement that Protocol. Further, as an operator

<<<

 in an energy intensive sector governed by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme we are obliged to comply with the cap and trade policy, which aids countries in meeting their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we are subject

<<<

 to Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 21, 2004 concerning environmental liability and the prevention and remedying of environmental damage. Directive 2004/35/EC aims to prevent and remedy the pollution

<<<

 of water, damage to biodiversity and land contamination that causes serious harm to human health. As an operator, if any of our activities causes environmental damage, we may be required under that Directive to restore damage caused and/or

<<<

 pay for the clean-up and restoration, irrespective of whether we were at fault in causing the damage.
We also comply with local and national law and regulations in each of the countries in which we operate. We believe that by requiring compliance

<<<

 by all of our operations worldwide with European Union regulation and standards, we facilitate substantial compliance in all of the jurisdictions in which we have operations.
The risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent

<<<

 in industrial operations, including the publication paper industry. The pulp and paper production process generates effluent containing organic compounds and nutrients, which can lead to eutrophication and a lack of oxygen in vulnerable water

<<<

 environments. Our mills therefore have external treatment plants to reduce our discharges into water. For example, at our Albury operations, Albury is permitted to discharge effluent containing salt into the Murray River under its licence with

<<<

 the Environment Protection Authority. However, the licence also requires Albury to undertake a Green Offset Scheme which involves the removal of an offset amount of salt from another part of the Murray River catchment area. All of our paper

<<<

 mills generate air emissions. The air emissions are mainly the result of energy production from the burning of biofuel and
118

fossil fuel. The main air emissions are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate (ash and dust), in addition

<<<

 to carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuel.
Particulate matter from boilers is the main cause of local emissions to the air from our paper mills. All the mills have filters that keep these emissions at very low levels. In 2007, we established

<<<

 a greenhouse gas reduction target of 25% by 2020 compared to 2006 levels. At the end of 2013, we reached a reduction of 27% of our greenhouse gas emissions. We may also engage in carbon emission units programs, under appropriate local legislation

<<<

. For example, in Australia, we were issued with free permits to cover some of our carbon emissions under a carbon tax and emission trading scheme. This program was stopped by the Australian government on July 1,2014 and there is no certainty

<<<

 as to whether such a program would be implemented again in the future. If such a program were to be implemented, there is no certainty as to what form such program would take, or of the extent to which the Albury and/or Boyer mills would be

<<<

 affected by the program.
We have developed an internal environmental index to set targets and review our work to improve our resource efficiency and reduce our emissions on a continuous basis. All our wholly-owned mills utilizing fresh fiber

<<<

 have third-party verified chain-of-custody certification systems in place.
As part of our environmental policy, it is our aim that all of our production units should have certified environmental management systems. At present, all of our wholly

<<<

-owned mills are certified in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard of the International Organization for Standardization. In addition, our majority-owned mill operated by Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd. operates in compliance in all

<<<

 material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, the risk of environmental infractions is inherent in our industry, and, from time to time, we have experienced minor non-compliance with such laws and regulations

<<<

, or with the conditions of our emissions or other permits, and may do so again in the future.

Insurance
We have a centrally administered Global Insurance program at our head office. This program includes insurance covering property damage

<<<

 and business interruption, general third-party liability, directors and officers, crime and cargo. Our property damage cover provides protection at full replacement value, while the business interruption is covered for an 18-month indemnity

<<<

 period. We have high local focus on procedures and internal activities for preventive loss activities at every mill. In addition, in every 15 to 18 month interval, we perform a comprehensive risk audit program together with a highly qualified

<<<

 risk engineer from our insurer. The outcome of each individual survey audit is analyzed, and based on the resulting benchmark, we implement a best practice method for our mills in order to minimize risk.
We believe that we have obtained favorable

<<<

 global insurance terms and conditions for the Global Insurance program, and we are currently halfway through a three-year policy period.

Employees
As of December 31, 2013, we had 3,274 employees (excluding MNI, which had 350 permanent employees

). The following table provides details of our employees by business regions (excluding MNI) for the periods indicated:

Our mill workers are unionized in all of the countries in which we operate. We have collective bargaining agreements in place with several different unions, which relate to employees

<<<

 in each of our mills. Our collective bargaining agreements typically have durations of between 12 and 24 months. We have not experienced any major strikes in recent years. In addition to trade unions, we also consult with various local, national

<<<

 and European works councils, which primarily fulfill advisory roles. We are required under

119

certain circumstances to consult with one or more of the works councils before proceeding with certain transactions or activities, particularly

<<<

 in relation to any major reorganization. We believe that we have good relationships with the unions representing our employees and the works councils. We run various pension schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries

<<<

 in which we operate. As of December 31,2013, the majority of current and former employees were covered by such schemes, of which many were covered by defined benefit plans, with the remainder being covered by defined contribution plans. We

<<<

 have unfunded pension benefit obligations, of which the obligations in relation to the Walsum pension scheme are the largest. As of September 30, 2014, December 31,2013 and December 31,2012, our net pension obligations (net unfunded pension

<<<

 plans less net partly or fully funded pension plans) were NOK 681 million, NOK 692 million and NOK 618 million, respectively. In 2012, the net unfunded pension obligations were restated to NOK 618 million according to amended IAS 19, mainly

<<<

 caused by the removal of the corridor approach for actuarial gains and losses. The comparable figures in previous years are not restated due to divestment of subsidiaries. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of our business we are party

<<<

 to a number of legal proceedings. None of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition, taking into account insurance coverage and provisions made

<<<

 for potential exposures.

Innovasjon Norge Facilities
On May 15, 2009, we entered into two facility agreements with substantially identical terms with Innovasjon Norge for an aggregate amount of NOK 250 million. The facilities are used for general

<<<

 corporate purposes. We are the only borrower under each facility.
As of September 30, 2014, the aggregate amount outstanding under the facilities was NOK 165 million. The final maturity date of each facility is June 10, 2021. The interest rate

<<<

 for borrowings under each facility is a commercial floating rate of interest which may be adjusted unilaterally by Innovasjon Norge from time to time with a one week notice period.
Each facility contains customary undertakings, subject in each

<<<

 case to certain customary exceptions and materiality thresholds, including, among others, restrictions on disposals of assets, dividends, change of business, loans and acquisitions, and restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness and guarantees

<<<

. Each facility also restricts us and each of our subsidiaries from granting security over assets or revenue (negative pledge).
We will secure approximately 10 million of our obligations under the facilities by granting a first lien security

 interest over certain assets of Norske Skog Skogn and, if required, Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS. Certain companies will provide guarantees for approximately 10 million of the facilities.
SpareBank 1 Gruppen Finans AS Factoring Agreements

 interest in favor of News Limited in respect of these amounts, reducing in accordance with an amortization schedule set out in the agreement. Two mortgages have been granted by Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited to secure Norske Skog

 (Australasia) Pty Limited's obligations under this agreement, both of which have been registered. One of the mortgages is in respect of land on which effluent from the mill is discharged under the Green Offset Scheme discussed above. At September

If the Transaction Security is being enforced as set forth above under the

(i) an Instructing Group; or
(ii) prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third paragraph under the caption ``-- E n fo rc e m e n t o f S e c u rity " above

 Subordinated Creditors,

shall instruct (provided that any such instructions are consistent with certain ``security enforcement principles,'' as set out below) or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit

<<<

, in each case, taking into account the requirements of each relevant security document and the ``security enforcement principles,'' as set out below.
S e c u rity E n fo rc e m e n t P rin c ip le s
The following is a summary of the ``security

<<<

 enforcement principles'', which are set out in the Intercreditor Agreement:
(a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to achieve the ``Security Enforcement Objective''. The ``Security Enforcement

<<<

 Objective'' means maximizing, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from an enforcement of the Transaction Security, recovery by the Primary Creditors.
(b) The security enforcement principles may be amended

<<<

, varied or waived with the prior written consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that no additional obligations may be imposed on a member of the Group without the consent of the Parent

<<<

.
(c) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to enforcement will be taken such that either:
i. all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance with the provisions set

<<<

 out under the caption ` `-- A p p lic a tio n o f P ro c e e d s -- O rd e r o f A p p lic a tio n " (the "Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall '); or
ii. in the event that the Majority Senior Secured Creditors are issuing instructions as to the

<<<

 enforcement of the Transaction Security, sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall, the Super Senior

<<<

 Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).
(d) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal will be determined by the Instructing Group, provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective

<<<

.
(e) On:
i. a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds 5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or
ii. a proposed enforcement

<<<

 of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group over which transaction security exists,
the Security Agent shall, upon instruction from the Instructing Group (unless it is incompatible with enforcement

<<<

 proceedings in a relevant jurisdiction) appoint an internationally recognized investment bank or a ``big four'' accounting firm or other reputable, third party independent professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations

<<<

 of businesses or assets, in each case as selected by the Security Agent acting reasonably and in good faith (an ``Advisor''), to opine as expert that the proceeds received from any such enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after

<<<

 taking into account all relevant circumstances (including the method of enforcement) (an ` Advisor's Opinion'').
(f) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint an Advisor or to seek the advice of an Advisor, unless expressly

<<<

 required to do so by these security enforcement principles or any other provision of the Intercreditor Agreement.
(g) The Advisor's Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other enforcement of the

<<<

 Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.
154

(h) Where the Instructing

<<<

 Group is the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may waive the requirement for an Advisor's Opinion where sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that

<<<

 when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full.
(i) In the event that an enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares

<<<

 referred to in paragraph (e)(i) or (e)(ii) above and such enforcement is conducted by way of ``public auction'', the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors shall be entitled to participate in such auction on the basis of equal

<<<

 information and access rights as other bidders and financiers in the auction. Nothing in this paragraph (i) shall require enforcement of the Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction.
(j) In the absence of written notice from

<<<

 a secured party or group of secured parties that are not part of the relevant Instructing Group that such secured part(y/ies) object to any enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to

<<<

 achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an ``Objection''), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.
(k) If the Security Agent receives

<<<

 an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgment in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), an Advisor's Opinion (or any equivalent opinion referred to

<<<

 in paragraph (g) above) to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph (a) above has been met.

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each creditor (other than any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Senior Notes Trustee) agrees with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put

<<<

. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this paragraph entitles any party to exercise or require any other creditor under

 the Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that creditor.
W aiver o f R ights
To the extent

 permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Transaction Security be enforced in any

 in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.
S e cu rity H e ld b y O th e r C reditors
If any Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then that creditor may only enforce that security

 in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that creditor).
D u tie s O w e d

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the Transaction Security prior to the Senior Discharge Date

 be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law.

 in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors
The Intercreditor Agreement generally provides that if, for any reason, any Senior Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and the resulting losses are not borne by the

 Agreement) will make such payments among themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne

DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES

<<<


Norske Skog AS (the ``Issuer'') will issue the Senior Secured Notes (throughout this ``D e s c rip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u re d N o te s " , the ``Notes'') under an indenture (the ``Indenture'') among the Issuer, Norske Skogindustrier

 Parent Guarantor, the ``Parent Guarantors''), the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined herein), Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (in such capacity, the ``Trustee''), and as security agent (in such capacity, the ``Security Agent''), in

<<<

 a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ``U.S. Securities Act''). Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this ` `D e s c rip tio n o f th e

<<<

 S e n io r S e c u re d N o te s " to the Notes include the Notes and any Additional Notes (as defined herein) that are issued. The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture will not incorporate or include any

<<<

 of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness

<<<

, turnover obligations, release of Security Interests (as defined herein) and Note Guarantees (as defined herein), and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See ``D e s c r ip tio n o f O th e r In d e b te d n e

This ` `D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s ' ' is intended to be an overview of the material

<<<

 provisions of the Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Security Documents (as defined herein) and the Intercreditor Agreement. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture

<<<

, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors and your rights.
Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under ``-- C e rta in

<<<

 D e fin itio n s " have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading ``-- C e rta in D e fin itio n s " . In this description, the term ``Issuer

<<<

'' refers only to Norske Skog AS, and not to any of its Subsidiaries.
The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.
Brief Description of the

<<<

 Notes
The Notes
The Notes will, upon issuance:
 be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under ``--S e c u rity " ;
 rank p a r i p a s s u in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer

<<<

 that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;
 rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;
 be effectively subordinated

<<<

 to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;


<<<

 be guaranteed by the Guarantors; and
 be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.
Under the terms of the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only after certain super senior priority obligations, including certain Hedging Obligations, have been repaid in full.
163

The Note Guarantees

<<<


The Notes will be guaranteed (each such guarantee, a ``Note Guarantee'') by the Guarantors. In addition, if required by the covenant described under ``-- C e rta in C o v e n a n ts -- L im ita tio n s o n Is s u a n c e s o f G u a ra n te

<<<

 e s o f In d e b te d n e s s ,'' certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future.
The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:
 be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under `

<<<

`-- S e c u rity " ;
 rank p a r i p a s s u in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;
 rank senior in right of payment to any existing

<<<

 and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and
 be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by

<<<

 property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.
The Note Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations, including, among other things, general

<<<

 statutory limitations, capital maintenance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, ``thin capitalization'' rules, retention of title claims and similar principles.
Principal, Maturity and Interest
The Issuer issued

<<<

 290,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes in exchange for an equal aggregate principal amount of Temporary Notes. The Issuer may issue additional Notes (``Additional Notes'') under the Indenture from time to time after this offering

<<<

. Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant described below under the caption ``-- C e rta in C o v e n a n ts -- In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a

<<<

 n c e o f P r e fe r r e d S to c k " . The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions

<<<

 and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Issuer will issue Notes in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on December 15, 2019 and will be repayable

<<<

 at par.
Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 11.75% per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2015. Interest on overdue principal and interest, including

<<<

 Additional Amounts, if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the Notes. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding June 1 and December 1.
Interest on the

<<<

 Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Paying Agent and

<<<

 Registrar for the Notes
The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a ``Paying Agent'') for the Notes in the City of London. The Issuer will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a member state of the Pre-Expansion European

<<<

 Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC (as amended from time to time) or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and

<<<

 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch in London.
The Issuer will also maintain

<<<

 one or more registrars (each, a ``Registrar'') with offices in London. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent in London. The initial Registrar will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The initial transfer agent will be Citibank, N.A.

<<<

, London Branch. The Registrar and the transfer agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes

<<<

 on the behalf of the Issuer.
164

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to the holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange

<<<

 and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper

<<<

 having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the L u x e m b u rg e r W ort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Note

<<<

 Guarantees
General
The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by the Guarantors.
As of and for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2014, the Guarantors accounted for 108% of the Parent Guarantor's consolidated EBITDA and held 89% of the Parent Guarantor's total assets. For information on the calculation of EBITDA, see ` `P re s e n ta tio n o f F in

<<<

 a n c ia l a n d O th e r In fo rm a tio n -- N o n -IF R S a n d O th e r F in a n cia l M easures ".
Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable

<<<

 fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation,

<<<

 a Guarantor's obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See ``R is k F a c to rs --

A substantial portion of the operations

<<<

 of the Issuer will be conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of

<<<

 the Issuer and the Guarantors, including holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors). Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant

<<<

 exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under the Indenture. See

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released upon:
 with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor

, a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a direct or indirect holding company), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially

<<<

 all the assets of the Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture (including, without limitation, the covenant described under the captions ` `R e p u rc h a s e a t th e O p tio n o f H o ld e rs -- C h a n g

The Trustee shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested by the Issuer,

<<<

 including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and

<<<

 indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.
Transfer and Exchange
Notes sold within the United States

<<<

 to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ``144A Global Notes''), and Notes sold

<<<

 outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ``Reg S Global Notes'' and together with the

<<<

 144A Global Notes, the ``Global Notes'').
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the ``Book-Entry Interests'') will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such

<<<

 participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under ` `T ra n s fe rR e s tric

<<<

 tio n s " . In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established

<<<

 by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in each 144A Global Note, may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the applicable Reg S Global Note, only upon

<<<

 delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.
Book-Entry Interests in each Reg S Global

<<<

 Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the applicable 144A Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect

<<<

 that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ``qualified institutional buyer'' within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with

<<<

 the transfer restrictions described under ` `T ra n s fe r R e s tric tio n s " and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding

<<<

 paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer

<<<

, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum

<<<

 denominations of 100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It

<<<

 is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book

<<<

-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described

<<<

 more fully under ``Transfer R e s tric tio n s " .
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100

<<<

,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the
166

form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the

<<<

 transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates

<<<

 and opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.
Notwithstanding

<<<

 the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the

<<<

 date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection

Following the repayment of the loans outstanding under Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited's Loan Agreement with the State of Tasmania, which are scheduled to mature in January 2017, the Indenture

 will provide that the Issuer will cause the Notes and the Note Guarantees to be secured by a first-ranking security interest in the land and standing timber stock in Tasmania owned by Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited, which is presently

 Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness, including Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture.
The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security

 Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under

<<<

 the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute Collateral.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets may not be secured or such security perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including (without

<<<

 limitation):
 if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders and the other secured parties;
 if providing such security requires consent of a third party and, if the asset is material, such consent

<<<

 cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;
 if providing such security would be prohibited by applicable law, general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, ``thin capitalization

<<<

'' rules or similar matters or entering into the Security Documents would conflict with the fiduciary duties of directors, contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of directors

<<<

 or officers; and
 if perfecting such security would have an unreasonable adverse effect on the ability of the security grantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by this Indenture.
The assets

<<<

 that comprise the Collateral may also secure on a first-ranking basis certain future Hedging Obligations, certain of which may be entitled to payment from the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes, and may also

<<<

 secure any Additional Notes and certain future other Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes.
No appraisals of the Collateral have been

 made in connection with the issuance of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of

 obligations, including certain Hedging Obligations, have been paid in full. See ``D e s c r ip tio n o f O th e r In d e b te d n e s s -- In te rc r e d ito r A g r e e m e n t." In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional

Security Documents
Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of

<<<

 the Issuer's and the Guarantors' payment obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent and, in relation to the

<<<

 Australian and New Zealand security documents, security trustee for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the

<<<

 Trustee and the holders of Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent and, in relation to the Australian and New Zealand security documents, security trustee, of the counterparties

<<<

 under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.
The Indenture will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the

<<<

 Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes

<<<

, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent.
The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof

<<<

 and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged

<<<

. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under ``--R e le a s e o f L ie n s .''
In the event that the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries enter into

<<<

 insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to

<<<

 the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See ` `R is k F a c to rs -- R is k s R e la te d to th e N

Enforcement of Security Interest
The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the holders or the Trustee to enforce

<<<

 the Security Interests and will provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by certain hedge counterparties. These limitations are described under ` `D e s c

Im p a irm e n t o f S e curity In te re st" .
The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required)

 will take all necessary action reasonably requested by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional

 Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required

(7) any Taxes imposed, levied or withheld by reason of

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer

 obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including, making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), and the requirement arises as a result of:
(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or any regulations

 or rulings promulgated thereunder of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of these listing particulars (or, if the

 to be paid as a result of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor conducting business other than in the place of its organization, such amendment or change must be announced and become effective on or after the date in which the Issuer or the

 relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, begins to conduct business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer

<<<

 or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantees were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice

<<<

 is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be

<<<

 subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect

173

that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition

 reasonable measures available to it.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described

 above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.
The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis

 to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Mandatory Redemption
The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Repurchase at the Option

<<<

 be redeemed in whole and not in part) of that holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate

<<<

 principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the ``Change of Control Payment''), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant

<<<

 record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder's registered address or otherwise deliver a

<<<

 notice in accordance with the procedures described under ``-- S e le c tio n a n d N o tic e " , stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the ``Change of Control Payment Date'') specified

<<<

 in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply

<<<

 with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a

<<<

 Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and

 will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly

 tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable, an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes

 properly tendered; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuer

<<<

.
The Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable, will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for
174

such Notes, and the Trustee

(or an authentication agent approved by it) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer

 will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change

<<<

 of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes

<<<

 to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of

<<<

 factors. The future Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover

<<<

, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase

<<<

 on the Issuer. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary

<<<

 to make any required repurchases.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with

<<<

 the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given

<<<

 pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption ` `-- O p tio n a l R e d e m p tio n ", unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein

<<<

, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is

<<<

 made.
The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ``all or substantially all'' of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ``substantially all'', there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of

<<<

 Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group

<<<

 may be uncertain.
The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in

<<<

 principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.
If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of

<<<

 the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the L u x e m b u rg e r W ort) or, to the

<<<

 extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Asset Sales
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly

<<<

 or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(1) the Parent Guarantor (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity

<<<

 Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
175

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of

<<<

 this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:
(a) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities), that are assumed by the transferee

<<<

 of any such assets and as a result of which the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;
(b) any securities, notes or other obligations

<<<

 received by the Parent Guarantor or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset

<<<

 Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;
(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Parent Guarantor

<<<

 and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and
(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or any Guarantor received from Persons who

<<<

 are not the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is cancelled.
Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (except (a) when the Net Proceeds from a single transaction or series of related transactions

<<<

 exceeds 20.0 million in aggregate (other than an Asset Sale of the New Zealand Power Plant, the Net Proceeds of which may be applied as set forth in this paragraph) or (b) when such Net Proceeds constitute Excess Cumulative Proceeds (as defined

<<<

 herein)), the Parent Guarantor (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary):
(1) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to

<<<

 all holders of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase (a ``Notes Offer'');
(2) to make a capital expenditure; or
(3) any combination

<<<

 of the foregoing.
Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
When

<<<

 the aggregate amount of Net Proceeds from (a) Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant exceeds 15.0 million (the aggregate amount of Net Proceeds not so applied or invested, ``Excess

<<<

 Proceeds''), (b) a single transaction or series of related transactions exceeds 20.0 million in aggregate (other than an Asset Sale of the New Zealand Power Plant, the Net Proceeds of which may be applied as set forth in the second paragraph

<<<

 of this section), or (c) Asset Sales in excess of the Cumulative Asset Sale Threshold exceeds 15.0 million (the ``Excess Cumulative Proceeds''), in each case, within ten Business Days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an ``Asset Sale

<<<

 Offer'') to all holders of Notes and may make an offer to all holders of other Pari Passu Indebtedness to purchase, prepay or redeem with the Excess Proceeds, the Net Proceeds or the Excess Cumulative Proceeds, as applicable, the maximum principal

<<<

 amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed

<<<

 out of the Excess Proceeds, Net Proceeds or Excess Cumulative Proceeds, as the case may be. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional

<<<

 Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess

<<<

 Proceeds, Net Proceeds or the Excess Cumulative Proceeds, as applicable, remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds, Net Proceeds or Excess Cumulative Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited

<<<

 by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, Net Proceeds or Excess

<<<

 Cumulative Proceeds so applied, the Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable, will be selected to be purchased on a pro
176

rata basis (or in the manner described under ``--S e le c tio n a n d N o tic e ' '), based on

<<<

 the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds, Net Proceeds or Excess Cumulative Proceeds will be reset at zero.
The Issuer will comply with the requirements

<<<

 of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or

<<<

 an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws

<<<

 and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Selection and Notice
If less than all of the Notes are to

<<<

 be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar, as appropriate, will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under ``B o o k -E n try , D e liv e ry a n d F o r m 

<<<

'' , based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee and the Registrar shall

<<<

 not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
No Notes shall be redeemed in part if the resulting Note would have a minimum denomination that is less than 100,000. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class

<<<

 mail at least ten but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice

<<<

 is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal

<<<

 amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption

<<<

 become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear

<<<

, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for

<<<

 trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg or, to the extent

<<<

 and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes

<<<

 outstanding.
Certain Covenants
Suspension of Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade
If on any date following the Issue Date:
(1) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and
(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred

<<<

 and be continuing on such date,
then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (such period, the ``Suspension Period''), the covenants specifically listed under the

<<<

 following captions in these listing particulars will no longer be applicable to the Notes and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<


Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period; p ro v id e d that (1) with respect to Restricted

<<<

 Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption ``--R e s tric te d P a y m e n ts " had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension

 Period and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (2) of the second paragraph of the caption ``-- In

There can be no assurance that

 the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.
Restricted Payments
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:
(1) declare or pay any dividend

Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred

 Stock
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise

 event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (22) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Parent

<<<

<<<

 on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such

 incurred, except that to the extent that:
(1) such euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence

<<<

; and
(2) the principal amount of the Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such Permitted Refinancing

<<<

 Indebtedness is being incurred.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded

<<<

 solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability

<<<

 in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;
(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
184

 the Indenture, the Notes and any Note Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable p a r i p a s s u basis with the Obligations so secured (and if such Obligations so secured are subordinated in right of payment to either the Notes or any

 Note Guarantee, on a senior priority basis) until such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by a Lien and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.
Any such Lien thereby created

 in favor of the Notes or any such Note Guarantee pursuant to the preceding clause (a)(2) will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the

 case of any such Lien in favor of any such Note Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a

 holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where (i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Parent Guarantor

<<<

 or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a tender offer statement, registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and

 the laws of Norway or of the European Union or its member states), which the Parent Guarantor in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (A) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome

<<<

 with each other Guarantor (if any), which Note Guarantee shall be senior to or p a r i p a s s u with such Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness, provided that (i) a Restricted Subsidiary's Note Guarantee may be limited in amount

<<<

 to the extent required by fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit, financial assistance or other similar laws (but, in such a case (A) each of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best efforts to overcome

<<<

 the relevant legal limit and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate the relevant limit and (B) the relevant Note Guarantee shall be given

<<<

 on an equal and ratable basis with the guarantee of any other Indebtedness giving rise to the obligation to Guarantee the Notes), (ii) for so long as it is not permissible under applicable law for a Restricted Subsidiary to become a Guarantor

<<<

, such Restricted Subsidiary need not
189

become a Guarantor (but, in such a case, each of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best efforts to overcome the relevant legal prohibition precluding the

<<<

 giving of the Note Guarantee and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate the relevant limit, and shall give such Note Guarantee at such time

<<<

 (and to the extent) that it thereafter becomes permissible) and (iii) no such Note Guarantee will be required as a result of any Guarantee granted in connection with the operation of cash management or cash pooling programs. Upon the execution

<<<

 and delivery of such supplemental indentures, such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Note Guarantee created pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant shall

<<<

 provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) (i) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary (including as a result of any sale, exchange or transfer (including by way of

<<<

 in compliance with the Indenture or (b) the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiary described in the preceding paragraph of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment

<<<

 in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness) (but not under the relevant guarantee)), at a time when (i) no other Indebtedness in excess of 10.0 million has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary; or (ii) the holders of all such

<<<

 other Indebtedness in excess of 10.0 million which is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness

<<<

 (but not under the relevant guarantee)).
If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Parent Guarantor

 post such reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted

<<<

 Subsidiary if (1) such designation would not cause a Default and (2) the Issuer would, at the time of such designation, have been permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Senior Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant

<<<

 under the caption ``--In c u rre n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P re fe rre d S to c k " . If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding

<<<

 Investments owned by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available

<<<

 for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption ``--R e s tric te d P a y m e n ts ' or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent Guarantor. That designation

<<<

 will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Parent Guarantor may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution

<<<

 of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption ``-- R e s

 tric te d P a y m e n ts " . If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and

<<<

 any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption ``--In c u

<<<

 rre n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P re fe rre d S to c k " , the Parent Guarantor will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary

<<<

 to be a Restricted Subsidiary; p r o v id e d that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a
190

Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will

<<<

 only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption ``--In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P r e fe r r e d S to c k ", calculated on a p r o fo rm a basis

The Exchange Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below

<<<

-- In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P re fe rre d S to c k " . The Exchange Notes and any Additional Exchange Notes subsequently issued under the Exchange Notes Indenture will be treated as a single class

<<<

 for all purposes under the Exchange Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Exchange Notes Indenture. The Exchange Notes Issuer issued 202

<<<

1 Notes in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The Exchange Notes Issuer issued 2023 Notes in denominations of $150,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The 2021 Notes will mature on

<<<

 February 24, 2021 and will be repayable at par and the 2023 Notes will mature on February 24, 2023 and will be repayable at par.
Interest on the 2021 Notes accrues at the rate of 8.00% per annum and interest on the 2023 Notes accrues at the

<<<

 rate of 8.00% per annum. Interest on the Exchange Notes are payable semi-annually in arrears on February 24 and August 24, commencing on August 24, 2015. Interest on overdue principal and interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will

223

Interest on the

<<<

 Exchange Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Paying

<<<

 Agent and Registrar for the Exchange Notes
The Exchange Notes Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a ``Paying Agent'') for the Exchange Notes in the City of London . The Exchange Notes Issuer will ensure that it maintains a

<<<

 Paying Agent in a member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC (as amended from time to time) or any other directive implementing the

<<<

 conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying Agent will be Citibank

<<<

, N.A., London Branch in London.
The Exchange Notes Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ``Registrar'') with offices in London. The Exchange Notes Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent in London. The initial Registrar

<<<

<<<

 to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on the behalf of the Exchange Notes Issuer.
The Exchange Notes Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior

<<<

 notice to the holders. For so long as the Exchange Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock

<<<

 Exchange so require, the Exchange Notes Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the L u x e m b u rg e r W o

<<<

 rt) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Exchange Note Guarantees
General
The obligations of the Exchange Notes Issuer pursuant to the Exchange

<<<

 Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured senior subordinated unsecured basis by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The obligations of the Exchange Notes Issuer

<<<

 pursuant to the Exchange Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by the Parent Guarantors.
As of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Guarantors accounted for 108% of the Parent Guarantor's consolidated

<<<

 EBITDA and held 89% of the Parent Guarantor's total assets. For information on the calculation of EBITDA, see ` `P r e s e n ta tio n o f F in a n c ia l a n d O th e r In fo rm a tio n --N o n - IF R S a n d O th e r F in a n cia l M easures

Each Exchange Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision

<<<

 of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Exchange Note Guarantee could be significantly less than

<<<

 amounts payable with respect to the Exchange Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Exchange Note Guarantee. See ` `R is k F a c to rs -- R is k s R e la te d to th e N o te s a n d th e G u a ra n te e s --

A substantial portion of the operations of the Exchange Notes Issuer will be conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders

<<<

 (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Exchange Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including holders

<<<

 of the
224

Exchange Notes. The Exchange Notes and each Exchange Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

 of the Exchange Notes Issuer (other than the Guarantors). Although the Exchange Notes Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number

<<<

 of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Exchange Notes Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under the

<<<

 Exchange Notes Indenture. See ``-- C e rta in C o v e n a n ts -- In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d
Issuance o f P referred S to ck" .
Subordination of the Subsidiary Guarantors' Exchange Note Guarantees
Each of the Subsidiary

<<<

 Guarantor's Exchange Note Guarantees is a senior subordinated Guarantee, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each such Exchange Note Guarantee ranks behind, and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing

<<<

 and future Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the holders of which (or their representatives) are party to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including any obligations owed by the relevant

<<<

 Subsidiary Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes. The ability to take enforcement action against the Subsidiary Guarantors under their Exchange Note Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

 and the terms of the Exchange Note Guarantees, and may be subject to significant restrictions in any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

, see ` `D e s c r ip tio n o f O th e r In d e b te d n e s s -- In te r c r e d ito r A g r e e m e n t.' '
Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors of a Subsidiary

<<<

 Guarantor would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Exchange Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor. In any case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining

<<<

 to pay the principal of or interest on the Exchange Notes.
Further, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under its Exchange Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Exchange Note Guarantee from constituting

<<<

 a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or capital maintenance regulations. See ``R is k F a c to r s -- R is k s R e la te d to th e N o te s a n d th e G u a ra n te e s -- F

 of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amounts cannot be paid by the Exchange Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Exchange Notes Issuer and/or the relevant Guarantors

 cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including, making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), and the requirement arises as a result of:
(1) any amendment to, or change

<<<

 in, the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of these

 listing particulars (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date these listing particulars, such later date); or
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official interpretation or application of

 proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of these listing particulars (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of these listing particulars, such later date).
In the

 case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor conducting business other than in the place of its organization, such amendment or change must be announced and become effective

<<<

 on or after the date in which the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, begins to conduct business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.
The Exchange Notes Issuer will not give any such notice

<<<

 of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Exchange Notes or any Exchange

<<<

 Note Guarantees were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Exchange Notes pursuant

 to the foregoing, the Exchange Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld

)) to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Exchange Notes Issuer to redeem the Exchange Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Exchange Notes Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the

 Exchange Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Exchange Notes Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.

232

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will

 Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Exchange Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Exchange Notes Indenture.
For the avoidance of

 with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.
Mandatory Redemption
The Exchange Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect

 to the Exchange Notes.
Repurchase at the Option of Holders
Change of Control
If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Exchange Notes will have the right to require the Exchange Notes Issuer to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples

 of 1,000 or US$1,000, as the case may be; p ro v id e d that Exchange Notes of 100,000 or US$150,000, as the case may be, or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of that holder's Exchange Notes pursuant to a Change of Control

 Offer on the terms set forth in the Exchange Notes Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Exchange Notes Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Exchange Notes repurchased, plus accrued

<<<

 and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Exchange Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the ``Change of Control Payment''), subject to the rights of holders of Exchange Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest

<<<

 due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Exchange Notes Issuer will mail a notice to each holder of the Exchange Notes at such holder's registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in

<<<

 accordance with the procedures described under ` `-- S e le c tio n a n d N o tic e " , stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Exchange Notes on the date (the ``Change of Control Payment Date'') specified

<<<

 in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Exchange Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Exchange

 Notes Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the

 Exchange Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Exchange Notes Indenture, the Exchange Notes Issuer will

<<<

 comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Exchange Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Exchange Notes Issuer

<<<

 will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Exchange Notes or portions of Exchange Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer

<<<

, as applicable, an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Exchange Notes or portions of Exchange Notes properly tendered; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Exchange Notes properly accepted

<<<

 together with an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Exchange Notes or portions of Exchange Notes being purchased by the Exchange Notes Issuer.
233

The Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer

, as applicable, will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Exchange Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Exchange Notes, and the Trustee (or an authentication agent approved by it) will promptly

 authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Exchange Notes surrendered, if any. The Exchange Notes Issuer will publicly announce the

<<<

 results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
The provisions described above that require the Exchange Notes Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control

<<<

 will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Exchange Notes Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Exchange Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders

<<<

 of the Exchange Notes to require that the Exchange Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Exchange Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The ability of the Exchange Notes Issuer to repurchase Exchange Notes

<<<

 pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The Senior Secured Notes contain, and future Indebtedness of the Exchange Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would

<<<

 constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Exchange Notes of their right to require the Exchange Notes Issuer to repurchase the Exchange

<<<

 Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Exchange Notes Issuer. Finally, the ability of the Exchange Notes Issuer to pay cash to

<<<

 the holders of the Exchange Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.
The Exchange Notes

<<<

 Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Exchange

<<<

 Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Exchange Notes Issuer and purchases all Exchange Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant

<<<

 to the Exchange Notes Indenture as described above under the caption ` `-- O p tio n a l R e d e m p tio n ", unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

<<<

 herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control

<<<

 Offer is made.
The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ``all or substantially all'' of the properties or assets of the Exchange Notes

<<<

 Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ``substantially all'', there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly

<<<

, the ability of a holder of Exchange Notes to require the Exchange Notes Issuer to repurchase its Exchange Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Exchange Notes Issuer

<<<

 and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.
The provisions under the Exchange Notes Indenture relating to the Exchange Notes Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Exchange Notes

<<<

 as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Exchange Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.
If and for so long as the Exchange Notes

<<<

 are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Exchange Notes Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change

<<<

 of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the L u x e m b u rg e r W ort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of

<<<

 the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Asset Sales
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(1) the Parent Guarantor (or the Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
(2) at least 75% of the consideration

<<<

 received in the Asset Sale by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:
(a) any liabilities, as recorded on

<<<

 the balance sheet of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

 are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;
(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent Guarantor or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee

<<<

 that are converted by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;
(c) Indebtedness

<<<

 of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Parent Guarantor and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection

<<<

 with such Asset Sale; and
(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or any Guarantor received from Persons who are not the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is cancelled.
Within 395 days after the

<<<

 receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Parent Guarantor (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary):
(1) to purchase

<<<

 the Exchange Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Exchange Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase (a ``Notes Offer''

<<<

);
(2) to make a capital expenditure;
(3) to purchase, repurchase, prepay, redeem or repay any Senior Secured Notes, any other Senior Indebtedness or any Existing Parent Notes (other than the Parent Guarantor's 7.125% senior notes due 2033)

<<<

; or
(4) any combination of the foregoing.
Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings in any manner that is not prohibited

<<<

 by the Exchange Notes Indenture.
When the aggregate amount of Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant exceeds 15.0 million (``Excess Proceeds''), the Exchange Notes

<<<

 Issuer will make an offer (an ``Asset Sale Offer'') to all holders of Exchange Notes and may make an offer to all holders of other Pari Passu Indebtedness to purchase, prepay or redeem with the Excess Proceeds or the Net Proceeds maximum principal

<<<

 amount of Exchange Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or

<<<

 redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Exchange Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment

<<<

 or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Exchange Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an

<<<

 Asset Sale Offer, the Exchange Notes Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds or Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Exchange Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Exchange Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness

<<<

 tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such
235

Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds so applied, the Exchange Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable, will be selected to be purchased

<<<

 on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under ` `-- S e le c tio n a n d N o tic e " ), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will

<<<

 be reset at zero.
The Exchange Notes Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection

<<<

 with each repurchase of Exchange Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer provisions

<<<

 of the Exchange Notes Indenture, the Exchange Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer provisions

<<<

 of the Exchange Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Selection and Notice
If less than all of the Exchange Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar, as appropriate, will select Exchange Notes for redemption

<<<

 on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Exchange Notes issued in global form as discussed under ``B o o k -E n try , D e liv e ry a n d F o r m " , based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair

<<<

 and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
No Exchange Notes shall

<<<

 be redeemed in part if the resulting Note would have a minimum denomination that is less than 100,000 or US$150,000, as the case may be. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least ten but not more than 60 days before

<<<

 the redemption date to each holder of Exchange Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance

<<<

 of the Exchange Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Exchange Notes Indenture.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note

<<<

 that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Exchange Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Exchange Notes called for redemption

<<<

 become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Exchange Notes or portions of Exchange Notes called for redemption.
For Exchange Notes which are represented by global certificates

<<<

 held on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing

<<<

. So long as any Exchange Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Exchange Notes

<<<

 shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, in connection with any redemption

<<<

, the Exchange Notes Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Exchange Notes outstanding.
Certain Covenants
Suspension of Covenants when Exchange Notes Rated Investment Grade
If on any date following

<<<

 the Issue Date:
(1) the Exchange Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and
(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such date,
then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at

 which the Exchange Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (such period, the ``Suspension Period''), the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in these listing particulars will no longer be applicable to the

Exchange

 Notes and any related default provisions of the Exchange Notes Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Exchange Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

Such covenants will

 not, however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Parent Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period; p ro v id e d that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made

 after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption ``--R e s tric te d P a y m e n ts " had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period and

 (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (2) of the second paragraph of the caption ``-- In c u r r e

<<<

 n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P r e fe r r e d S to c k " . Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
There can be no assurance that the Exchange Notes will

 ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:
(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other

 date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item

 principal amount of the Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness

 is being incurred.
243

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability

 Person, the lesser of:

 are secured on an equal and ratable p a r i p a s s u basis with the Obligations so secured (and if such Obligations so secured are subordinated in right of payment to either the Exchange Notes or any Exchange Note Guarantee, on a senior priority

 basis) until such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.
Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Exchange Notes or any such Exchange Note Guarantee pursuant to the preceding clause (2) will be automatically and unconditionally

Limitations on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness
The Parent Guarantor will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Guarantee any Indebtedness in excess of 10.0 million unless such

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing for a Exchange Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on a joint and several basis with each other Guarantor (if any), which

<<<

 Exchange Note Guarantee shall be subordinated to such Subsidiary's Guarantee of Senior Indebtedness and senior to or p a r i p a s s u with such Subsidiary's Guarantee of Indebtedness (other than Senior Indebtedness), provided that (i) a Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary's Exchange Note Guarantee may be limited in amount to the extent required by fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit, financial assistance or other similar laws (but, in such a case (A) each of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best efforts to overcome the relevant legal limit and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate the relevant

<<<

 limit and (B) the relevant Exchange Note Guarantee shall be given on an equal and ratable basis with the guarantee of any other Indebtedness giving rise to the obligation to Guarantee the Exchange Notes), (ii) for so long as it is not permissible

<<<

 under applicable law for a Restricted Subsidiary to become a Guarantor, such Restricted Subsidiary need not become a Guarantor (but, in such a case, each of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best

<<<

 efforts to overcome the relevant legal prohibition precluding the giving of the Exchange Note Guarantee and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate

<<<

 the relevant limit, and shall give such Exchange Note Guarantee at such time (and to the extent) that it thereafter becomes permissible) and (iii) no such Exchange Note Guarantee will be required as a result of any Guarantee granted in connection

<<<

 with the operation of cash management or cash pooling programs. Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indentures, such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Exchange Note Guarantee

<<<

 created pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) (i) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary (including as a result of any sale, exchange or transfer (including by way of merger or consolidation), to any Person, of all of the Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary) or (ii) a sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition

 s ' ' (including the requirements relating to the application of proceeds) and otherwise in compliance with the Exchange Notes Indenture or (b) the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiary described in the preceding

<<<

 paragraph of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness) (but not under the relevant guarantee)), at a time when (i) no other Indebtedness in excess

<<<

 of 10.0 million has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary; or (ii) the holders of all such other Indebtedness in excess of 10.0 million which is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness (but not under the relevant guarantee)).
If and so long as the Exchange Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted

Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries
The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if (1) such designation would not cause a Default and (2) the Exchange Notes Issuer would, at the time of such

<<<

 designation, have been permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant under the caption ``--In c u rre n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P r e fe r r e d S

<<<

 to c k " . If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as

<<<

 an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption ``-- R e s tric te d P a

<<<

 y m e n ts ' or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent Guarantor. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary

<<<

 otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Parent Guarantor may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of

<<<

 the Parent Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such

<<<

 designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption ``-- R e s tric te d P a y m e n ts " . If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements

<<<

 as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Exchange Notes Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such

<<<

 date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption ``--In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P re fe rre d S to c k " , the Parent Guarantor

<<<

 will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; p ro v id e d that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence

<<<

 of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption ``

<<<

--In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P r e fe r r e d S to c k " , calculated on a p r o fo rm a basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default

<<<

 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

<<<

 the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Exchange Note Guarantees, and to provide, if applicable, for

<<<

 Senior Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness, in each case as permitted by the terms of the Exchange Notes Indenture; p ro v id e d that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or

<<<

 Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Exchange Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

.
252

The Exchange Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Exchange Notes Issuer and without the consent of holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Parent Guarantor

<<<

 permitted below under ` `-- A m e n d m e n t, S u p p le m e n t a n d W a iv e r,' ' and the Exchange Notes Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose

 any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Exchange Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Exchange Notes Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall

253

or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such

<<<

 Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date

 of such default (a ``Payment Default''); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

<<<

 of any amounts that an insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment

<<<

 or order, by reason of an appeal, waiver or otherwise, shall not have been in effect;

<<<

 Exchange Notes Indenture with respect to the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary

<<<

.
In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the Exchange Notes Issuer and any Guarantor, all outstanding Exchange Notes will become due and payable immediately without further

<<<

 action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Exchange Notes may declare all amounts in respect of the Exchange Notes

<<<

 to be due and payable immediately.
Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Exchange Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold

<<<

 from holders of the Exchange Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional

<<<

 Amounts or premium, if any.
Subject to the provisions of the Exchange Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the

<<<

 rights or powers under the Exchange Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Exchange Notes unless such holders have offered (and if accepted, provided) to the Trustee indemnity or security (including by way of pre-funding

<<<

) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under ``-- A m e n d m e n t, S u p p le m e n t a n d W a iv e r" ) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any

<<<

, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Exchange Notes Indenture or the Exchange Notes unless:
(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default

<<<

 is continuing;
(2) holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Exchange Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against

<<<

 any loss, liability or expense;
254

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of

<<<

 the then outstanding Exchange Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Exchange Notes outstanding may

<<<

, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Exchange Notes, waive any past default under the Exchange Notes Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts

<<<

The Exchange Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance

<<<

 with the Exchange Notes Indenture.
No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders

<<<

 of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Exchange Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Exchange Notes. The waiver may not be

<<<

 effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.
Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
The Exchange Notes Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer's

<<<

 Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Exchange Notes and all obligations of any Guarantors discharged with respect to their Exchange Note Guarantees (``Legal Defeasance'') except for:


<<<

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Exchange Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Exchange Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred

<<<

 to below;
(2) the Exchange Notes Issuer's obligations with respect to the Exchange Notes concerning issuing temporary Exchange Notes, registration of Exchange Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Exchange Notes and the maintenance of

<<<

In addition, the Exchange Notes Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Exchange Notes Issuer and the Guarantors

<<<

 released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Exchange Notes Indenture (``Covenant Defeasance'') and thereafter any omission to comply

<<<

 with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Exchange Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under ` `-- E v e n ts o f D e fa u lt a n d R e m e d ie s

<<<

 " (except those relating to payments on the Exchange Notes or, solely with respect to the Exchange Notes Issuer, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Exchange Notes.
In order to

<<<

 exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(1) the Exchange Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Exchange

<<<

 Notes, cash in euros, non-callable Euro Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable Euro Government Obligations (in the case of the Euro-denominated Exchange Notes) and cash in US dollars, non-callable US Government

<<<

 bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any) on the outstanding Exchange Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable

<<<

 redemption date, as the case may be, and the Exchange Notes Issuer must specify whether the Exchange Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;
(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Exchange

<<<

 Notes Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Exchange Notes Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service

<<<

 a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Exchange

<<<

 Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if

<<<

 such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Exchange Notes Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the holders of the

<<<

 outstanding Exchange Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the

<<<

 same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM
General
The Temporary Notes sold within the United States

<<<

 to QIBs pursuant to Rule 144A and the Senior Secured Notes issued in respect of certain of such Temporary Notes will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ``Rule 144A

<<<

 Global Notes''). The Temporary Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S and the Senior Secured Notes issued in respect of certain of such Temporary Notes will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered

<<<

 form without interest coupons attached (the ``Regulation S Global Notes'' and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ``Global Notes''). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the

<<<

 name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (``144A Book-Entry Interests'') and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ``Regulation

<<<

 S Book-Entry Interests'' and, together with the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ``Book-Entry Interests'') will be limited to persons who have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons who may hold interests through such participants

<<<

. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will be issued

<<<

 only in denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration

<<<

 and transfer systems a participant's account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical

<<<

 delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global

<<<

 Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or ``holders'' of Notes under the Temporary Notes Indenture or the

<<<

 Indenture, as applicable, for any purpose.
So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their or its respective nominee) will be considered the sole holder of Global Notes for all

<<<

 purposes under the Temporary Notes Indenture and the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the

<<<

 participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Temporary Notes Indenture and the Indenture.
None of the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying

<<<

 Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent under the Temporary Notes Indenture or the Indenture or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

<<<


Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes
Under the terms of the Temporary Notes Indenture and the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form (the ``Definitive Registered Notes''):
 if Euroclear

<<<

 or Clearstream notifies the Temporary Notes Issuer or the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository for the Global Notes and a successor depository is not appointed by the Temporary Notes Issuer or the Issuer within

<<<

 120 days;
 if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Temporary Notes Indenture or the Indenture; or
 if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear

<<<

 or Clearstream following an event of default under the Temporary Notes Indenture or the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Temporary Notes Indenture or the Indenture.
In such an event, the Temporary

<<<

 Notes Issuer or the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary

<<<

 procedures and based
281

upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in `` T ra n s fe r R e s

<<<

 tric tio n s " unless that legend is not required by the Temporary Notes Indenture or the Indenture or applicable law.
Redemption of Global Notes
In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream

<<<

, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them or it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them or it in respect of the redemption of

<<<

 such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global

<<<

 Note (or any portion thereof). The Temporary Notes Issuer and the Issuer understand that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit

<<<

 their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; p ro v id e d , h o w e v e r, that no Book-Entry Interest of less

<<<

 than 100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.
Payments on Global Notes
Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be

<<<

 made by the Temporary Notes Issuer or the Issuer to the Paying Agent. In turn, the Paying Agent will make such payments to the common depository or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants

<<<

 in accordance with their respective procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except

<<<

 as may be required by law and as described under ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s -- A d d itio n a l A m o u n ts .'' If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described

<<<

 under ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s -- A d d itio n a l A m o u n ts ,' ' we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner

<<<

 of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding

<<<

 or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.
Under the terms of the Temporary Notes Indenture and

<<<

 the Indenture, the Temporary Notes Issuer or the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of

<<<

 receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility

<<<

 or liability for:
 any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any

<<<

 participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;
 payments

<<<

 made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account

<<<

 of a Book-Entry Interest;
 Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or
 any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.
Payments by participants

<<<

 to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants.
282

Currency and Payment for the Global Notes
The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect

<<<

 of, the Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in Euro.
Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests
Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Temporary Notes Issuer and the Issuer

<<<

 that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the

<<<

 aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action

<<<

 in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute

<<<

 such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.
Transfers
Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear's and Clearstream's rules and will be settled in immediately

<<<

 available funds. If a holder of Notes requires the physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require the physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities

<<<

, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.
The Global Notes will bear a legend

<<<

 to the effect set forth under `` T ra n s fe r R e s tric tio n s .'' Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under ``T ra n s fe r R e s tric tio n

<<<

 s .' '
Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person

<<<

 who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation

<<<

 S under the Securities Act.
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided

<<<

 in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a ``qualified institutional buyer'' within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 1

<<<

44A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ` `T ra n s fe r R e s tric tio n s " and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
In connection with transfers involving an exchange

<<<

 of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount

<<<

 of the Rule 144A Global Note.
Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s -- T ra n s fe r a

<<<

 n d E x c h a n g e ,'' and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions

<<<

 applicable to such Notes. See `` T ra n s fe r R e s tr ic tio n s .''
Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will

<<<

, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures

<<<

 applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.
283

Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream
All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures

<<<

 of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The Temporary Notes Issuer and the Issuer provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement

<<<

 system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.
Euroclear and Clearstream hold

<<<

 securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear

<<<

 and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic

<<<

 securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

 is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.
Euroclear and Clearstream have

<<<

 no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of

<<<

 an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite

<<<

 certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In

<<<

 addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.
Global Clearance and Settlement Under

<<<

 the Book-Entry System
The Senior Secured Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Issuer expects that secondary

<<<

 trading in any Notes will be settled in accordance with rules and operating procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and/or the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Although Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order

<<<

 to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued

<<<

 or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations

<<<

 under the rules and procedures governing their operations.
Initial Settlement
Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures

<<<

 applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value

<<<

 on the settlement date.
Secondary Market Trading
The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to

<<<

 establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and the seller's accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.
284

TAX CONSIDERATIONS
Certain Norwegian Tax Considerations

<<<


The following is a general presentation of certain Norwegian tax consequences resulting from the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This presentation does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations

<<<

 that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this presentation does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser subject to special tax regimes, such as banks, insurance

<<<

 companies or tax-exempt organizations. This summary is based on the laws currently in force and as applied on the date of these listing particulars in the Kingdom of Norway which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
Prospective

<<<

 purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the effect of any state or local taxes under the tax laws applicable in the

<<<

 kingdom of Norway and each country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.
Please note that for the purpose of the summary below, a reference to a Norwegian or non-Norwegian holder of Notes refers to the

<<<

 tax residency and not the nationality of the holder.
Taxation of interest
N orw eg ian h o ld e rs o f N otes
Both corporate and individual holders of Notes who are tax residents of Norway are subject to Norwegian tax on interest received with

<<<

 a flat tax rate currently at 27%. For Norwegian holders holding Notes issued with a discount (compared to the nominal value) such discount will be taxed in the year of the realization of the Notes.
Any interest received in foreign currency

<<<

 is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the taxable interest income.
N o n -N o rw e g ia n h o ld e rs o f N otes
In general, payments of interest on Notes issued to holders who are not tax residents of Norway are not subject to

<<<

 Norwegian tax. Payments to non-Norwegian holders of Notes may therefore be made without any withholding tax or deduction for any Norwegian taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges.
If the Notes are held by an individual or by a company

<<<

 not tax resident of Norway, that is performing business activities in Norway, and the Notes are effectively connected with such business activities in Norway, interest received will be taxed in Norway with a tax rate of 27%.
Taxation of capital

<<<

 gains or losses on disposal of Notes
N orw eg ian h o ld e rs o f N otes
Capital gains realized by Norwegian holders of Notes upon the sale, disposal or other redemption of Notes will be subject to Norwegian taxation at the rate of 27%. Corresponding

<<<

 losses will be tax deductible.
The taxable gain or deductible loss is calculated for each Note and is, in broad terms, equal to the sales price less the Norwegian Notes holders' cost price of the Note, including costs incurred in relation to

<<<

 the acquisition or realization of the Note. Any gain received in foreign currency when realizing Notes is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the taxable gain.
N o n -N o rw e g ia n h o ld e rs o f N otes
Capital gains realized

<<<

 by non-Norwegian holders of Notes upon the sale, disposal or other redemption of Notes are normally not subject to Norwegian tax. Corresponding losses will generally not be tax deductible.
Such capital gains may be taxable in Norway if the

<<<

 non-Norwegian holder of Notes is performing a business activity in Norway and the Notes are effectively connected with such business activity.
285

Net wealth tax
C o rpo rate h o ld e rs
Both Norwegian and non-Norwegian corporate holders

<<<

 of Notes are exempt from Norwegian net wealth tax.
In d iv id u a l h o ld e rs
Individual holders of Notes who are tax residents of Norway are liable to Norwegian net wealth tax. The value of the Notes is included in the basis for the computation

<<<

 of net wealth tax imposed on such holders of Notes. The value for assessment purposes for listed Notes is the listed value as of 1 January in the year of assessment. Unlisted Notes will normally be valued at face value. Currently, the marginal

<<<

 net wealth tax rate is 1% of the taxpayer's net wealth.
Non-resident individual holders of Notes are not liable to pay net wealth tax in Norway on the value of the Notes unless Notes are effectively connected with a business that the individual

<<<

 holder of Notes carries out in Norway.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined

<<<

 below), including the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes and, potentially, cash. This summary deals only with initial purchasers of Temporary Notes at the issue price that are U.S. Holders and that will hold the Notes as capital

<<<

 assets. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by

<<<

 particular investors (including consequences under the alternative minimum tax or net investment income tax), and does not address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws. This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that

<<<

 may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt

<<<

 organisations, dealers in securities or currencies, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens

<<<

 or lawful permanent residents of the United States, investors holding the Notes in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United States, U.S. expatriates or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).

<<<


As used herein, the term ``U.S. Holder'' means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organised under the laws of

<<<

 the United States or any State thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over

<<<

 the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The

<<<

 U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective purchasers

<<<

 that are entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of

<<<

 Notes by the partnership.
This summary is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court

<<<

 decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ``IRS'') regarding the matters discussed below

<<<

. No assurance can be given that IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a different position concerning the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Notes from the tax consequences described below

<<<

.
THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE RELIED UPON BY PURCHASERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED UNDER THE
286

U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE

<<<

 CODE. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING, AND DISPOSING OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING, THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX

<<<

 LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.
Treatment of the Notes
In certain circumstances (i) the Temporary Notes Issuer may be required to redeem a portion of the Temporary Notes for cash and (ii) the Issuer may be obligated to make additional

<<<

 payments on the Notes in excess of the stated interest and principal amount (e.g., as described under ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s -- A d d itio n a lA m o u n ts " ). The possibility of such redemption and

<<<

/or such payments could be viewed as causing the Notes to be treated as ``contingent payment debt instruments'' for U.S. federal income tax purposes (``CPDIs''). If the Notes were to be treated as CPDIs, U.S. Holders may be required to recognize

<<<

 income for U.S. federal income tax purposes at different times and in different amounts than described below, to treat any income realized on a taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than capital gain, and to suffer other adverse

<<<

 U.S. federal income tax consequences. Although the issue is not free from doubt, the Issuer intends to take the position (to the extent it is required to do so) that the Notes should not be treated as CPDIs. Our determination that the Notes

<<<

 should not be treated as CPDIs is binding on a holder unless the holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable regulations. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding

<<<

 the U.S. federal income tax consequences in the event the Notes were to be treated as CPDIs. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be so treated.
Treatment of the Exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes

<<<


Following the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations, an amount of Temporary Notes will be exchanged for Senior Secured Notes and a portion of the Temporary Notes may be redeemed for cash. Depending upon the terms of this

<<<

 exchange and possible redemption, including whether the entire amount of Temporary Notes are exchanged for Senior Secured Notes, it is possible that the Exchange could be treated as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as

<<<

 discussed in more detail below.
E xchange o f the e ntire a m o u n t o f T em porary N otes fo r S e n io r S e c u re d N otes
Although the issue is not free from doubt, if the entire amount of the Temporary Notes are exchanged for Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes, and no portion of the Temporary Notes are redeemed for cash, the Issuer expects to take the position (to the extent it is required to do so) that the exchange of the Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes should not be treated

<<<

 as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible, however, that the Internal Revenue Service could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes, in the case where

<<<

 the entire amount of the Temporary Notes are exchanged for Senior Secured Notes (and no portion of the Temporary Notes are redeemed for cash), as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If the exchange of Temporary Notes for

<<<

 Senior Secured Notes is not treated as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder would not recognize any income, gain or loss in connection with such transaction and would have the same adjusted tax basis in the

<<<

 Senior Secured Notes as the U.S. Holder had in the Temporary Notes exchanged therefor. Moreover, the holding period for the Senior Secured Notes would generally include the holding period for the Temporary Notes.
E xchange o f T em porary N

<<<

 otes in p a rt fo r S e n io r S e c u re d N otes a n d p a rtia l re d e m p tio n o f Tem porary N otes fo r cash
Although the issue is not free from doubt, if the Temporary Notes are exchanged in part for Senior Secured Notes and are partially

<<<

 redeemed for cash, the Issuer expects to take the position (to the extent it is required to do so) that the receipt of Senior Secured Notes in exchange for Temporary Notes should be treated as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax

<<<

 purposes. It is possible, however, that the Internal Revenue Service could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes, in the case where Temporary Notes are exchanged in part for Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes and are partially redeemed for cash for cash, as not constituting a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
287

If the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes is treated as a taxable exchange, U.S

<<<

. Holders would generally recognize gain or loss in connection with such exchange (as described below under ``--S a le a n d O th e r T axable D is p o s itio n o f th e N o te s " ) and would have a new holding period and a new tax basis in

<<<

 the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of the Senior Secured Notes at the time of such exchange is less than the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (by more than a statutorily

<<<

 defined de minimis amount), the Senior Secured Notes may be treated as issued with OID (as described below under ``--O rig in a l Is s u e D is c o u n t" ). In the event that the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes is treated

<<<

 as a taxable exchange, the issue price of the Senior Secured Notes is expected to be equal to the fair market value of the Senior Secured Notes at the time of the Exchange because it is expected that a substantial amount of the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes will be treated as traded on an established market for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Senior Secured Notes are not so treated, then other rules would apply for purposes of determining the issue price of the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

. The remainder of this discussion assumes that, in the event that the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes is treated as a taxable exchange, the issue price of the Senior Secured Notes will be equal to the fair market value

<<<

 of the Senior Secured Notes at the time of the exchange.
Holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes and, potentially

<<<

, cash, including the determination of the issue price of the Senior Secured Notes in the event that the exchange of the Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes is treated as a taxable exchange.
Payments of interest
G e n e ra l. Interest on

<<<

 a Note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on such holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes and OID accrued

<<<

 with respect to the Notes (as described below under ``--O rig in a l Is s u e D is c o u n t" ) constitutes income from sources outside the United States. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers concerning the applicability

<<<

 of the foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.
F o re ig n c u rr e n c y d e n o m in a te d in te re s t. The amount of income recognised by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value

<<<

 of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognised with

<<<

 respect to an interest payment denominated in Euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or,

<<<

 in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year).
Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the

<<<

 exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year). Additionally

<<<

, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect

<<<

 on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable

<<<

 without the consent of the IRS.
Upon receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or retirement of a Note) denominated in Euros, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognise U

<<<

.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued, regardless

<<<

 of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
Original Issue Discount
G e n e ra l. Since the Temporary Notes will be treated as issued with more than a de minimis amount of OID, a U.S. Holder will be required to include a

<<<

 portion of the OID in gross income as interest in each
288

taxable year or portion thereof in which the U.S. Holder holds such Notes even if the U.S. Holder has not received a cash payment in respect of the OID. The same requirements will

<<<

 apply with respect to the Senior Secured Notes if the Senior Secured Notes are treated as issued with more than a de minimis amount of OID.
In general, notes will be treated as issued with more than a de minimis amount of OID if the amount

<<<

 of OID is not less than 0.25 per cent. multiplied by the product of the stated redemption price at maturity and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date. The amount of a note's OID is the excess of the note's stated redemption

<<<

 price at maturity over its issue price. The issue price of a note issued for cash is the first price at which a substantial amount of notes included in the issue of which the note is a part is sold to persons other than bond houses, brokers

<<<

, or similar persons or organisations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. The issue price of a note that is traded on an established market and is issued for property (such as the Senior Secured Notes issued

<<<

 in exchange for the Temporary Notes, in the event that such exchange is treated as a taxable exchange and the Senior Secured Notes are treated as traded on an established market, in each case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes) generally

<<<

 is the fair market value of such note, determined as of the issue date. In general, the stated redemption price at maturity of a note is the total of all payments provided by such a note that are not payments of qualified stated interest. In

<<<

 general, an interest payment on a note is qualified stated interest if it is one of a series of stated interest payments on the note that are unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate. The stated redemption price at maturity

<<<

 of a note is generally its principal amount.
U.S. Holders of notes treated as issued with more than a de minimis amount of OID must include OID in income calculated on a constant-yield method before the receipt of cash attributable to the income

<<<

, and generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID over the life of such notes. The amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder of such a note is the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the

<<<

 note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the note (``accrued OID''). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any ``accrual period'' a pro rata portion of the

<<<

 OID allocable to that accrual period. Accrual periods with respect to a note may be of any length selected by the U.S. Holder and may vary in length over the term of the note as long as (i) no accrual period is longer than one year; and (ii

<<<

) each scheduled payment of interest or principal on the note occurs on either the final or first day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period equals the excess of (a) the product of the note's adjusted issue price

<<<

 at the beginning of the accrual period and the note's yield to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (b) the sum of the payments

<<<

 of interest on the note allocable to the accrual period. The ``adjusted issue price'' of a note at the beginning of any accrual period is the issue price of the note increased by (x) the amount of accrued OID for each prior accrual period and

<<<

 decreased by (y) the amount of payments previously made on the note that were not interest payments.
Any OID for an accrual period will be determined in Euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued

<<<

 by an accrual basis U.S. Holder, as described above under ``Payments of Interest''. Upon receipt of an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a payment of interest or the sale or retirement of a note), a U.S. Holder may recognise

<<<

 U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued, regardless

<<<

 of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
E le c tio n to tre a t a ll in te re s t a s O ID . A U.S. Holder may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on a Note using the constant-yield method described

<<<

 above under ``-- O rig in a l Is s u e D i s c o u n t G e n e ra l" , with certain modifications. For purposes of this election, interest includes interest, OID, market discount and d e m in im is market discount, as adjusted by any amortisable

<<<

 bond premium or acquisition premium. This election generally applies only to the note with respect to which it is made and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers concerning the propriety

<<<

 and consequences of this election.
Sale and other taxable disposition of the Notes
A U.S. Holder generally will recognise gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realised on

<<<

 the sale or disposition and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis of the Note. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in a Note purchased with Euros generally will be
289

its U.S. dollar cost (as defined below), increased by the amount of any

<<<

 OID included in the U.S. Holder's income with respect to the Note and reduced by the amount of any principal paid on the Note. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Notes, in the event that the exchange of Temporary Notes

<<<

 for Senior Secured Notes is treated as a taxable exchange, generally is expected to be equal to the fair market value of the Senior Secured Notes on the date they are issued, increased by the amount of any OID included in the U.S. Holder's

<<<

 income with respect to the Senior Secured Note and reduced by the amount of any principal paid on the Senior Secured Note. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with Euros generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on

<<<

 the date of purchase, or the settlement date for the purchase, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations, that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an

<<<

 accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects). The amount realised does not include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income. The amount realised

<<<

 on a sale or other taxable disposition for an amount in Euros will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount on the date of sale or disposition, or the settlement date for the sale, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market

<<<

, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations, sold by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects). The amount realised by a U.S. holder with respect to the receipt of the Senior Secured Notes, in

<<<

 the event that the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes is treated as a taxable exchange, generally is expected to be equal to the fair market value of the Senior Secured Notes on the date they are issued.
A U.S. Holder generally

<<<

 is expected to recognise U.S. source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar values of the U.S. Holder's purchase

<<<

 price for the Note, in the case of Notes purchased with Euros, or the fair market value of the Senior Secured Notes at the time of the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes, in the event that the exchange of Temporary Notes for

<<<

 Senior Secured Notes is treated as a taxable exchange (i) on the date of sale or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder purchased the Note, in the case of Notes purchased with Euros, or the date on which the U

<<<

.S. Holder received the Senior Secured Notes, in the event that the exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes is treated as a taxable exchange. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect

<<<

 to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realised only to the extent of total gain or loss realised on the sale or other taxable disposition. Except to the extent resulting from changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognised

<<<

 by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year.
Gain or loss realised by a U.S. Holder

<<<

 on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale or other taxable disposition of Notes.
Disposition

<<<

 of foreign currency
Foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign currency is received. Foreign currency that

<<<

 is purchased generally will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency (including its use to purchase

<<<

 Notes or upon exchange for U.S. dollars) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.
Backup withholding and information reporting
Payments of principal and interest on, and the proceeds of the sale, retirement or other disposition of Notes

<<<

 by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary (and accruals of OID) will be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments, including payments of

<<<

 accrued OID, if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements. Certain U.S. Holders are not subject to backup withholding

<<<

. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.
290

Reportable transactions
A U.S. taxpayer that participates in a ``reportable

<<<

 transaction'' will be required to disclose its participation to the IRS. Under the relevant rules, if the Notes are denominated in a foreign currency, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes as

<<<

 a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the regulations (U.S.$50,000 in a single taxable year, if the U.S. Holder is an individual or trust, or higher amounts for other non-individual U.S. Holders), and to disclose

<<<

 its investment by filing Form 8886 with the IRS. A penalty in the amount of U.S.$10,000 in the case of a natural person and U.S.$50,000 in all other cases generally is imposed on any taxpayer that fails to timely file an information return

<<<

 with the IRS with respect to a transaction resulting in a loss that is treated as a reportable transaction. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the application of these rules.
Foreign financial asset reporting

<<<


U.S. taxpayers that own certain foreign financial assets, including debt of non-U.S. entities, with an aggregate value in excess of U.S.$50,000 at the end of the taxable year or U.S.$75,000 at any time during the taxable year (or, for certain

<<<

 individuals living outside the United States and married individuals filing joint returns, certain higher thresholds) may be required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes are expected to

<<<

 constitute foreign financial assets subject to these requirements unless the Notes are held in an account at a financial institution (in which case the account may be reportable if maintained by a foreign financial institution). U.S. Holders

<<<

 should consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the rules relating to foreign financial asset reporting.
Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations
The following paragraphs provide information on certain material Luxembourg tax consequences

<<<

 of purchasing, owning and disposing of the Temporary Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase or sell the Temporary Notes. It is based on the laws

<<<

, regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations presently in force in Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. This information does not take into account the specific

<<<

 circumstances of particular investors. Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.
Please be aware that

<<<

 the residence concept used in the sub-headings below applies for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers only

<<<

 to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax generally encompasses corporate income tax ( im p o ts u r le re v e n u d e s c o lle c t iv e s ) , municipal business tax ( im p o t c o m

<<<

 m e r c ia l c o m m u n a l) , a solidarity surcharge ( c o n tr ib u tio n a u fo n d s p o u r l 'e m p lo i) as well as personal income tax ( im p o t s u r le re v e n u ). Investors may further be subject to net wealth tax (im p o t s

<<<

 u r la fo rtu n e ) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge apply to most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are

<<<

 generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply

<<<

 as well.
Taxation of the Holders of Temporary Notes
Withholding Tax
Under the existing laws of Luxembourg and with the possible exception of interest to certain individual holders there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium

<<<

 or interest, or on accrued but unpaid interest, in respect of the Temporary Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the Temporary Notes.
In accordance with the law of November 25, 2014, Luxembourg

<<<

 will elect out the withholding system in favor of an automatic exchange of information under the Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of Savings income with effect as from January 1, 2015. Payments of interests to individual holders

<<<

 of Temporary Notes or to certain so-called residual entities will then no longer be subject to any withholding tax.
291

According to the Law of December 23, 2005 as amended, interest payments on the Temporary Notes paid by a Luxembourg paying

<<<

 agent will be subject to a withholding tax of 10% (the ``10% withholding tax'') if such payments are made for the immediate benefit of individuals resident in Luxembourg.
In the event that interest is paid to a Luxembourg resident individual

<<<

, the beneficiary may opt for the application of the 10% withholding tax in accordance with the Law of December 23, 2005 (the ``10% tax'').
The 10% withholding tax and the 10% tax will operate a full discharge of income tax for Luxembourg resident

<<<

 individuals acting in the context of the management of their private wealth. Responsibility for withholding such will be assumed by the Luxembourg Paying Agent.
Interest on the Temporary Notes paid by a Luxembourg paying agent to residents

<<<

 of Luxembourg which are not individuals will not be subject to any withholding tax.
Taxes on income and capital gains
Non-Resident holders of Temporary Notes
Non-resident holders of Temporary Notes, not having a permanent establishment, a permanent

<<<

 representative, or a fixed place of business in Luxembourg to which the Temporary Notes or income therefrom are attributable, are not subject to Luxembourg income taxes on income accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts,

<<<

 under the Temporary Notes nor on capital gains realised on the disposal or redemption of the Temporary Notes.
Non-resident holders who have a permanent establishment, a permanent representative, or a fixed place of business in Luxembourg to

<<<

 which the Temporary Notes are allocable, are subject to Luxembourg corporate income tax and municipal business tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts and on any gains realised upon the sale or disposal of

<<<

 the Temporary Notes.
Resident holders of Temporary Notes
In d ivid u a ls
If held in the context of carrying on an enterprise, any interest income, whether paid or accrued, and any capital gain or foreign exchange result whether realised or

<<<

 accrued, derived from the Temporary Notes is subject to Luxembourg income taxes (income tax levied at progressive rates and municipal business tax). The 10% withholding tax levied is credited against their final tax liability.
If held in the

<<<

 context of managing private wealth, interest income received is subject to income tax at progressive rates unless the 10% withholding tax or the 10% tax applied. Furthermore, capital gains realised upon disposal of Temporary Notes are taxable

<<<

 if realised within six months from their acquisition or if their disposal precedes the acquisition of the Temporary Notes. Upon redemption of the Temporary Notes, Luxembourg resident individuals must include the portion of the redemption price

<<<

 corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest in their taxable income, unless the 10% withholding tax or the 10% tax has been levied.
C o rpo rate h o ld e rs
Resident corporate holders of the Temporary Notes are always deemed to hold the Notes

<<<

 in the context of carrying on an enterprise. As such, any interest income, whether paid or accrued, and any capital gain or foreign exchange result whether realised or accrued, derived from the Temporary Notes is subject to Luxembourg income

<<<

 taxes (corporate income tax and municipal business tax).
Net wealth tax

292

Value Added Tax There is no Luxembourg

<<<

 value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the Temporary Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Temporary Notes or a transfer of the Temporary Notes. Luxembourg gift and inheritance

<<<

 taxes Inheritance tax is levied in Luxembourg at progressive rates (depending on the value of the assets inherited and the degree of relationship). No Luxembourg inheritance tax will be due in respect of the Temporary Notes unless the holder

<<<

 of the latter resides in Luxembourg at the time of his/her death. No gift tax is due upon the donation of Temporary Notes unless such donation is registered in Luxembourg (which is generally not required). Other Taxes There is no Luxembourg

<<<

 registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in Luxembourg by the holders of the Temporary Notes as a consequence of their issuance. No Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or other similar tax or duty is due either

<<<

 in case of a subsequent repurchase, redemption or transfer of the Temporary Notes. A fixed or an ad valorem registration duty may however apply (i) upon voluntary registration of the Temporary Notes in Luxembourg (there is in principle no obligation

<<<

 to register the Temporary Notes in Luxembourg though), (ii) in case of legal proceedings before a Luxembourg court or (iii) in case the documents relating to the Temporary Notes must be produced before an official Luxembourg authority (a u

 to rite c o n s titu e e ). US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ( "FATCA") On 28 March 2014, the governments of the United States of America and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed an inter-governmental agreement (``IGA'') in the form of

<<<

 a Model 1 agreement. A memorandum of understanding was also issued. The IGA is subject to ratification by Luxembourg's parliament and implementation of the IGA will be through Luxembourg's domestic legislative procedure. The legislative proposal

<<<

 to implement the IGA into Luxembourg law (``Luxembourg IGA Legislation'') is not public at the time of publication of this prospectus. Under this scenario, it is not possible for the Temporary Notes Issuer to make a final assessment of the

<<<

 requirements that FATCA provisions will place upon it. FATCA provisions may imply a 30% withholding tax for the Temporary Notes Issuer or for the Noteholders unless the Issuer and Noteholder comply with certain tax compliance obligations. The

<<<

 Temporary Notes Issuer commits to take all the necessary actions in order to comply with its FATCA obligations and in order that the Issuer and its Noteholders are not exposed to the 30% withholding tax under FATCA.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement

<<<

 (the ``Purchase Agreement'') dated as of the date of these listing particulars, the Temporary Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase, the Temporary Notes.
The Purchase Agreement

<<<

 provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Temporary Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.
The Initial Purchasers propose to offer

<<<

 the Temporary Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Temporary Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Temporary Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial

<<<

 Purchasers without notice. Sales of the Temporary Notes by the Initial Purchasers in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers.
Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp

<<<

 duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.
The Purchase Agreement provides that the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer

<<<

 and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect

<<<

 thereof. The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the

<<<

 Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase

<<<

 Agreement, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers.
The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States

<<<

 except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as

<<<

 described under ``Im p o r ta n t In fo rm a tio n A b o u t th e s e L is tin g P a r tic u la r s " and ` `T ra n s fe r R e s tr ic tio n s .'' The Initial Purchasers have represented, warranted and agreed that each:
 has only communicated

<<<

 or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by the Initial Purchasers in connection

<<<

 with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer or the Guarantors; and
 has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the

<<<

 FSMA with respect to anything done by them in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers

<<<

 that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of these listing particulars or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly

<<<

, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither these listing particulars nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees may be distributed or

<<<

 published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. These listing particulars do not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer

<<<

 to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession these listing particulars comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering

<<<

, the Exchange, the distribution of these listing particulars and resale of the Notes. See ` `Im p o r ta n t In fo rm a tio n a b o u t th e s e L is tin g P a r tic u la r s " and ``T ra n s fe r

The Notes and the Guarantees

<<<

 are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to trade the Notes on the Euro MTF Market thereof; however, we cannot

<<<

 assure you that such listing will be maintained.
297

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market

<<<

 in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities

<<<

 Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable

<<<

 to you. See " R is k F a c to rs -- R is k s R e la te d to th e N o te s a n d th e

In connection with the Offering and the Exchange, the Stabilizing Manager

<<<

, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging

<<<

, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Temporary Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position

<<<

. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market

<<<

 levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes

<<<

. See " R is k F a c to rs -- R is k s R e la te d to th e N o te s a n d th e
G u a ra n te e s -- Y ou m a y n o t b e a b le to s e ll y o u r N o t e s ' '.
These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of

<<<

 the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering and the Exchange are made and, if commenced

<<<

, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of Goldman Sachs International. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Temporary Notes Issue Date and 60 days after the date of

<<<

 the allotment of the Temporary Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad

<<<

 array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities

<<<

 activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuer's affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading

<<<

, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have, from time to time, performed

<<<

, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for us, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In particular, Citigroup Global Markets Limited or its affiliates have a

<<<

 lending relationship with us and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.

LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS
Set forth below is

<<<

 a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees or the Collateral are being provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy

<<<

, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes

<<<

 over which jurisdiction's law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Interests in the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief

<<<

 description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Norway, Australia, Austria, France, Germany and New Zealand.
European Union
The Temporary Notes Issuer, the Issuer and several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Member States

<<<

 of the European Union.
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended, (the ``EU Insolvency Regulation''), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State

<<<

 in which a company's ``centre of main interests'' (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has its center

<<<

 of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. To date, no final decisions have been made in cases that have been brought before the European Court of

<<<

 Justice in relation to questions of interpretation of the effects of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union.
Although there is a presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its center

<<<

 of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the center of main interests of a ``debtor should correspond to the

<<<

 place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.'' The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the center of main interests

<<<

 of a company, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company's creditors are established

<<<

. A company's center of main interests may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

<<<


The E.U. Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.
If the center of main interests of a company is in one Member State

<<<

 (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an ``establishment

<<<

'' in the territory of such other Member State. An ``establishment'' is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those insolvency proceedings

<<<

 opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State.
Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its center of main interests, any proceedings

<<<

 opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to ``winding-up proceedings'' listed in Annex B of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member

<<<

 State in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment where either: (a) insolvency proceedings

<<<

 cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company's center of main interests is situated under that Member State's law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually

<<<

 resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment.
299

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main

<<<

 proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because

<<<

 the company's center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations

<<<

, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets

<<<

.
Norway
Limitations on Guarantees and Security Interests provided by Guarantors incorporated in Norway
Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Private Limited Companies Act of 1997 No. 44/Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act of 1997 No. 45 (A k s je

<<<

 lo v e n and A llm e n n a k s je lo v e n ) (respectively and together, the ``Acts'', and each an ``Act''), restricts a Norwegian private or public limited liability company from providing financial assistance (including to put assets at disposal

<<<

, grant loans or provide security or guarantees) in connection with the acquisition of its shares or the shares in the parent company (and any intermediate parent company). Such financial assistance may only be provided within the limits of

<<<

 the company's distributable reserves and subject to the assistance being provided on ordinary commercial terms and the claim for repayment or restitution being adequately secured. Financial assistance may only be provided in connection with

<<<

 the acquisition of shares in the company which are fully paid. Before such financial assistance is granted certain procedural rules must be complied with. The board of directors shall ensure that the beneficial parties are subject to a credit

<<<

 assessment and the board will have to prepare a statement which, inter alia, describes the background for and terms and consequences of the financial assistance. Such statement will have to be presented to the general meeting of the company

<<<

, who in turn must approve the financial assistance. The restrictions on financial assistance applies irrespective of whether the company in which shares are acquired is a Norwegian or foreign company, and there are no general exemptions available

<<<

 except for special cases of real estate financing and employee share purchase programs. The restriction applies not only to granting of loans, guarantees and securities, but also to making assets available and other transfers which are not

<<<

 lawful distributions in accordance with the Acts. The assistance is restricted if made ``in connection with'' the acquisition of the shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition, for instance by way

<<<

 of a refinancing of acquisition debt or a subsequent merger of a target company and the acquiring entity.
In addition to the restrictions with regard to unlawful financial assistance outlined above, Section 8-7 of the Acts restricts a Norwegian

<<<

 limited liability company from granting credit to, guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of, its shareholders or a party related to the shareholder beyond its distributable reserves (free equity) and then further provided that

<<<

 satisfactory security for repayment/ recovery has been established. This restriction does not, however, apply to any granting of credit to or security/guarantee for the obligations of a parent company or another company within the same ``group

<<<

''. This exemption must be read in conjunction with the group definition in Section 1-3 of the Acts which, broadly speaking, includes Norwegian limited liability companies. Furthermore, there is an exemption for the granting of credit to or

<<<

 security/guarantee for the obligations of any other legal entity (or the subsidiary of such other legal entity) which has such a decisive influence over the company as mentioned in Section 1-3 of the Acts provided that the credit, security

<<<

 or guarantee is established in order to benefit the financial interests of the group of companies. Section 1-3 defines decisive influence as holding at least such number of shares in the company which represents a majority of the votes in the

<<<

 company or has the right to elect or discharge a majority of the members of the board of directors of such company. In practice, this exception will therefore be applicable to a Norwegian wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign company, provided

<<<

 that the guarantee is established in order to benefit the financial interests of the group of companies.
As a consequence of these restrictions, the value of the Guarantees and any security provided by a Norwegian guarantor may be reduced to

<<<

 zero to the extent it secured obligations relating to the acquisition of shares in itself or its parent company. In addition, the Guarantees or security interest infringing the limitations set forth in Section 8-10 and 8-7 of the Acts will

<<<

 be void, and any funds paid out will have to be repaid. Finally, an illegal arrangement of this kind may give rise to directors' liability issues.
300

As a general rule under Norwegian law, the board of directors of a Norwegian private or

<<<

 public limited liability company have a fiduciary duty to act in the interest of the company. Thus, the board of directors of a company is only permitted to resolve to guarantee the obligations of another group company to the extent this is

<<<

 in the interest of the company. This means that the board of directors in each case must carefully evaluate whether the benefits to it from guaranteeing the obligations of such other company equals or outweighs the obligations of the same.

<<<


The Guarantees and the Security Interests provided by Norwegian companies are subject to limitation language substantially in the form as follows:
``The obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor incorporated in Norway in its capacity as

<<<

 a Guarantor (each a ``Norwegian Guarantor'') shall not cover any indebtedness or liability which, if they did so extend, would cause an infringement of section 8-10 and/or section 8-7 cf. section 1-3, or any of the other provisions in chapter

<<<

 8 III, of the Norwegian Private Limited Companies Act 1997 (the ``Norwegian Companies Act'') regulating unlawful financial assistance and other prohibited loans, guarantees and joint and several liability as well as providing of security, and

<<<

 it is understood and agreed that the liability of any Norwegian Guarantor only applies to the extent permitted by the above-mentioned provisions of the Norwegian Companies Act. Under no circumstances shall the obligations and liabilities of

<<<

 any Norwegian Guarantor cover the debt and/or other liabilities incurred in respect of the purchase of the shares in such Norwegian Guarantor or the shares in any of such Norwegian Guarantor's Holding Companies.''
The limitations set forth

<<<

 in section 8-10 and/or section 8-7 cf. section 1-3 of the Acts will apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by a Norwegian Guarantor under the Collateral and to any guarantee, indemnity, any similar obligation resulting in a payment

<<<

 obligation and payment, including, but not limited to, set-off, pursuant to the Collateral and made by any Norwegian Guarantor. Such limitations on the liabilities and obligations of any Norwegian Guarantor may have the effect of reducing the

<<<

 amount of obligations or liabilities assumed and/or the amount guaranteed or secured to zero, to the extent to which any proceeds under the Notes are used in connection with the acquisition of shares in the Norwegian Guarantor or its parent

<<<

).
Insolvency
Norwegian insolvency legislation is regulated by the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 No. 58 (K o n k u rs lo v e n ) (the ``Bankruptcy Act''), which sets forth the various procedures to be followed both in the case of

<<<

 court-administered debt negotiations and bankruptcy proceedings, and the Creditors Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 No. 59 (D e k n in g s lo v e n ) (the ``Recovery Act'') containing provisions on, among other things, the priority of claims.
The

<<<

 key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the debtor's assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including the securing of

<<<

 existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling of the debtor's contractual relationships and (v) the distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are

<<<

 continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors.
Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor (by the representation of the Board of

<<<

 Directors) and the creditors (holding or pretending to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy.
There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debt as it becomes due, such

<<<

 payment difficulties not being of a temporary nature and (ii) the debtor must be in ``deficit'' (the company's debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values).
During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor's

<<<

 assets are controlled by the court-appointed liquidator (usually a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor's assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the

<<<

 estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors.
All of the debtor's assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the

<<<

 bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third-parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an
301

unlawful manner, or if the acquisition lacks legal protection, or if the transaction

<<<

 can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets, including, but not limited to, the realization

<<<

 of assets.
Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle

<<<

, realize the security, and cover their claims; however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy

<<<

 estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security with a wiping out effect on unmet liens and divide the proceeds between

<<<

 the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets.
Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of all assets secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a

<<<

 third-party for the debtor's indebtedness. Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act No. 17/2004 (the ``Financial Collateral

<<<

 Act'') or the Norwegian Liens Act No. 2/1980 section 6-4 (9).
Any under-secured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the assets securing the relevant creditor's claim) will be deemed an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim.
In a Norwegian

<<<

 bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:
 secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset--either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization

<<<

 undertaken by the bankruptcy estate);
 super-priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator's costs and obligations of the estate);
 salary claims (within certain limitations);
 tax claims (such as withholding

<<<

 tax and value-added tax within certain limitations);
 ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims); and
 subordinated claims (including interest incurred

<<<

 after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).
Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the

<<<

 three to twelve month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing

<<<

 debt and transactions at an undervalue. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor's debt, favor

<<<

 one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors' claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years.
Solvent enforcement

<<<


Enforcement of security normally requires that the pledgee or chargee files an application to the enforcement authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without the involvement of the

<<<

 enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial Collateral Act and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured party such right of enforcement is typically included in any security

<<<

 agreement between the pledgor/chargor and the secured party.
Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable

<<<

 promissory note). Thereafter the creditor may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim against the assets of the guarantor.
302

Creation and enforcement of security
Norwegian law provides for effectively creating

<<<

 security over a range of closely defined asset types (a floating charge may be established over certain asset types of a Norwegian company).
As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement

<<<

 situation and agreements on enforcement cannot validly be entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts and/or the Norwegian enforcement authorities. However, this

<<<

 is different for shares in a Norwegian limited company. If the secured party is a financial institution, the shares are considered financial collateral, and the parties are free (within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process

<<<

 in the share pledge agreement.
Also, for specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables 

<<<

(such as trade receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of the chargor.
The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood

<<<

 under common law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In practice, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security

<<<

 agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the

<<<

 security agent may, however, be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond

<<<

 trustee for an undisclosed number of bondholders can, based on the provisions in the bond agreement, take legal action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the bondholders and without having to disclose the entity of the bondholders

<<<

.
Luxembourg
Luxembourg insolvency proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Temporary Notes Issuer's business and assets and the Temporary Notes Issuer's obligations under the Temporary Notes. Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, your

<<<

 ability to receive payment on the Temporary Notes may be more limited than under United States bankruptcy laws. The following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be opened against the Temporary Notes

<<<

 Issuer having its registered office or center of main interests in Luxembourg:
 bankruptcy (fa illite ) proceedings, the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of its creditors; following such a request, a competent Luxembourg

<<<

 court may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company (i) is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (c e s s a tio n d e s p a ie m e n ts ), and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (e b ra n le m e n t d e c re d it); if a court

<<<

 finds that these conditions are met without any request, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion;
 controlled management proceedings (g e s tio n c o n tro le e ), the opening of which may only be requested by the company

<<<

 and not by its creditors; a reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% (fifty per cent.) in number of the creditors representing more than 50% (fifty per cent.) of the company's liabilities in order to take effect; and

<<<


 voluntary composition with creditors ( c o n c o r d a t p re v e n tif d e fa illite ), upon request only by the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its unsecured creditors representing at least 75% (seventy-five

<<<

 per cent.) of the company's liabilities) and not by its creditors. The court's decision to admit a company to a composition with participating creditors triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by participating creditors while other

<<<

 creditors may pursue their claims individually.
In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Temporary Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a suspension of payments (s u rs is d e p

<<<

 a ie m e n t) or to put the Temporary Notes Issuer into judicial liquidation (liq u id a tio n ju d ic ia ir e ) . Judicial winding up proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity

<<<

 violating criminal laws or seriously breaching the laws governing commercial companies. The management of such winding up proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings.
303

Generally, during the insolvency proceedings

<<<

, all enforcement measures by general secured and unsecured creditors against the company are stayed, while certain secured creditors (pledgees or mortgagees) retain the ability to settle separately while the debtor is in bankruptcy. Collateral

<<<

 over which a security right has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus of enforcement proceeds is realized). During controlled management

<<<

 proceedings, enforcement measures are suspended until the final reorganisation order from the adjudicating court, declarations of default and any subsequent acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default may not be enforceable and

<<<

 participating secured creditors in composition proceedings are required to abandon their security. Under the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the ``Collateral Act''), secured creditors

<<<

 holding qualifying collateral in the form of financial instruments or claims may enforce their security during the insolvency proceedings without court approval outside the general body of creditors and satisfy their claim in order of their

 priority in the enforcement proceeds.
Liabilities of the Temporary Notes Issuer in respect of the Temporary Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Temporary Notes Issuer following bankruptcy or judicial winding-up proceedings, rank

<<<

 junior to the cost of such proceedings (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such bankruptcy or judicial winding-up) and those debts of the Temporary Notes Issuer that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential rights

<<<

 arising by operation of law under Luxembourg law include:
 certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;
 value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;
 social security contributions; and

 owed to employees.
Luxembourg insolvency law may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Temporary Notes Issuer during the hardening period (p e rio d e s u s p e c te ) (which is a maximum of 6 (six) months and 10 (ten

<<<

) days) preceding the judgment adjudicating the insolvency proceedings, in particular, the granting of a security right for antecedent debt, the payment of debt not due (whether or not payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set

<<<

-off or by any other means) or of debt due by any means other than cash or bill of exchange or the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration. These transactions must be declared null and void, in all

<<<

 circumstances, at the request of the competent Luxembourg insolvency official (including any c o m m is s a ire , ju g e - c o m m is s a ire , liq u id a te u r o r c u ra te u r or similar official). Further, if the insolvency official demonstrates

<<<

 that (i) an adequate payment in relation to a due debt was made during the hardening period to the detriment of the general body of creditors, and/or (ii) the party receiving such payment knew that the company had ceased payments when such

<<<

 payment occurred, the insolvency official has the power, among other things, to invalidate such preferential transaction. Notwithstanding the above, a financial collateral arrangement under the Collateral Act entered into after the opening

<<<

 of liquidation proceedings or the entry into force of reorganization measures is valid and binding against third parties or insolvency officials notwithstanding the hardening period if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the

<<<

 opening of such proceedings or of the taking of such measures or that it could not reasonably have been aware of them. Generally, if the insolvency official demonstrates that the Issuer has given a preference to any person by defrauding the

<<<

 rights of creditors generally, a competent insolvency official (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the power to challenge such preferential transaction (including the granting of security right with fraudulent intent) without limitation

<<<

 of time.
In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in an automatic termination of contracts except for personal (in tu itu p e rs o n a e ) contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company

 or its solvency were crucial. However, the insolvency official may choose to terminate certain onerous contracts. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue v is -a -v is the bankruptcy estate

<<<

. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the Temporary Notes Issuer's business and assets and the Temporary Notes Issuer's obligations under the Temporary Notes (as Temporary Notes Issuer).
Finally, international

Australian securities
Each Australian Guarantor will grant a Security Interest over its present

<<<

 and future assets, including the shares held by it in its subsidiaries (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles). Security will also be granted over the shares in Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited. The Security

<<<

 Interests will be granted under a general security deed, a specific security deed (in respect of the shares of Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited) and separate real property mortgages. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, certain

<<<

 assets will be Excluded Assets. These will include assets which are subject to contractual restrictions on the grant of security interests and assets which are secured in favour of specific third parties where the grant of further security

<<<

 over those assets is not permitted (where there is such existing security and consent is given to the grant of the Security Interest, the security will be second-ranking security).
Accordingly, the Excluded Assets will (except to the extent

<<<

 consent is given by the existing security holders to the grant of security to the Noteholders) include, among other assets:
 the land over which mortgages have been granted by Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited to News Limited (see

Subject to the preceding

<<<

 paragraph, Security Interests will cover bank accounts, intellectual property, limited parcels of land which are subject to potential sale processes and proceeds of inventory and receivables, that are held by the Australian Guarantors. However

<<<

, the security will recognise that the Australian Guarantors may deal freely with those assets as part of their operations and that there may be prior ranking security over those assets (or prior ranking security may be created over those assets

<<<

). The Security Interests will also extend to real property except where this is not permitted by a negative pledge.
insolvency processes
Under Australian law, a company will be insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they become

<<<

 due and payable. Australian courts have held that this is a question of fact which involves consideration of the company's financial position as a whole, taking into account commercial realities.
As three of the Subsidiary Guarantors are located

<<<

 in Australia, proceedings may be commenced in Australia against those entities should any of them become insolvent.
Insolvency proceedings in Australia can take a number of forms, the most relevant for Noteholders being the voluntary administration

<<<

, liquidation and receivership processes. The law relating to these proceedings is complex and detailed. The below is only a brief summary of the key features which are likely to be relevant to Noteholders.
Voluntary administration
The voluntary

<<<

 administration process in Australia is governed by Part 5.3A of the Australian Corporations Act. Voluntary administration is an out-of-court insolvency procedure that can be initiated by the directors of a company, a secured creditor who is

<<<

 entitled to enforce a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the company, or if the company is already in liquidation, by its liquidator. As unsecured creditors, the Holders of the Exchange Notes will

<<<

 therefore be unable to initiate the voluntary administration process. Additionally, while a company is in voluntary administration,
305

unsecured creditors may not begin, continue or enforce these claims against the company without the administrator

<<<

's consents or the court's permission.
Outside the voluntary administration procedure, Australian law imposes a strict duty on directors of a company to prevent insolvent trading. For directors, failure to prevent insolvent trading carries with

<<<

 it a risk of personal liability under section 588G of the Australian Corporations Act, which if established can result in civil and criminal penalties. If a company is found to have traded whilst insolvent, directors can be personally liable

<<<

 for debts incurred by the company whilst the company was insolvent. Upon the appointment of a voluntary administrator, the directors cease to control the company and their liability for future trading ceases (although liability continues in

<<<

 respect of trading prior to the administrators' appointment). Accordingly, voluntary administration can be described as a ``safe harbor'' for directors and, as a result, is a step commonly taken by directors where they become concerned that

<<<

 a company may be insolvent or is likely to become insolvent in future.
The procedure involves the appointment of an administrator to a company that is, or is likely to become, insolvent. It is a temporary process in the sense that it is not

<<<

 an end in itself. Rather, the administrator assumes management of the company's business, property and affairs (the directors' powers being suspended) for a short time with a view to either:
 maximizing the chances of the company, or its business

<<<

, remaining in existence; or
 if it is not possible for the company or its business to remain in existence, resulting in a better return for the company's creditors and members than would result if the company were to enter liquidation.
In

<<<

 large administrations it is common for the administration (and therefore the moratorium period (referred to below)) to be extended by the Court, and this could be for up to 6 to 18 months.
Once an administrator has been appointed, the administrator

<<<

 must investigate the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances (and the directors are required to assist the administrator in doing this). Two meetings of creditors are held. The first is held within eight business days

<<<

 of the administrators' appointment. The purpose of that meeting is largely to confirm the appointment of the administrator, or to enable creditors to resolve to replace that administrator.
The second meeting is held within 20 business days

<<<

 of the administrators' appointment. If the administration occurs during the Christmas or Easter holiday period, the period is 25 business days. Prior to the second meeting, the administrator must formulate an opinion as to whether the administration

<<<

 should end (thus returning the company to the directors, for example because the company can continue to trade on a solvent basis), the company should be subject to a deed of company arrangement (in essence, a contract that binds all creditors

<<<

, the company and sometimes others and seeks to restructure/rehabilitate the company), or the company should be wound up, and must report to creditors. At the second meeting, creditors may resolve on one of those three outcomes by a simple majority

<<<

 resolution. The capacity to vote on the resolution gives creditors a significant measure of control over the outcome of the voluntary administration procedure, in particular whether a deed of company arrangement is approved or whether the company

<<<

 goes into liquidation.
There is a risk that a Court may make an order under section 444F of the Australian Corporations Act preventing the secured creditor from realising or dealing with its secured interest if doing so would have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on achieving the purposes of a deed of company arrangement approved by creditors at the end of the administration. However, such an order will only be made if the secured creditor's interests will be adequately protected.
During

<<<

 the voluntary administration procedure, a statutory moratorium is imposed which prevents the enforcement of Security Interests against the company and its assets. There are exceptions to the moratorium which apply if the relevant security interest

<<<

 has been perfected within the meaning of the P e rs o n a l P ro p e rty S e c u ritie s A c t 2 0 0 9 of Australia (``PPS Act''), which is summarised below. In particular, a creditor that holds a security interest over the whole, or substantially

<<<

 the whole, of the property of the company is permitted to enforce its security interest within the 13 business day period from the commencement of the administration.
It is common for secured lenders to take security over the whole or substantially

<<<

 the whole of the property of Australian companies to avail themselves of this exception. However, it should be noted that under Australian law, the meaning of ``substantially the whole'' of a company's property remains unsettled. It will likely

<<<

 be interpreted under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular

receive on a winding up of the company. A security

<<<

 interest could be declared void (and therefore unenforceable) if a liquidator establishes to a Court that:
 it is an unfair preference;
 it was granted (or an act was done to give effect to it) when the company was insolvent (or the company

<<<

 became insolvent as a result of entry into (or giving effect to) the transaction); and
 it was granted into during the six months prior to the liquidator's appointment.
 Uncommercial Transaction: this is a transaction of a company that a

<<<

 reasonable person in the company's position would not have entered into, having regard to the benefits and detriment to the company, the benefits to the other parties to the transaction and any other matters the Court considers relevant. A

<<<

 security interest could be declared void if a liquidator establishes to a Court that:
 it is an uncommercial transaction;
 it was granted (or an act was done to give effect to it) when the company was insolvent (or the company became insolvent

<<<

 as a result of entry into (or giving effect to) the transaction); and
 it was granted during the two years prior to the liquidators' appointment.
 Transaction to Defeat, Delay or interfere with the Rights of Creditors: a liquidator could

<<<

 also seek to set aside a security interest if it established to a Court that:
 the company granted the security interest for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of defeating, delaying, or interfering with, the rights of any

<<<

 or all of its creditors on a winding up of the company;
 the security interest was granted (or an act was done to give effect to it) when the company was insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of entry into (or giving effect

<<<

 to) the transaction); and
 the security interest was granted during the 10 years prior to the liquidators' appointment.
 Unreasonable director-related transactions: certain transactions involving a director or a close associate of a director

<<<

 may be liable to be set aside if it can be demonstrated that a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into them, having regard to:
 the benefit or detriment to the company in entering into the transaction;

<<<


 the benefit to other parties to the transaction; and
 any other relevant matter.
 Circulating Security interest: this is a security interest granted by the company over certain or all of its ``circulating assets''.
There are two tests for

<<<

 whether an asset is a circulating asset. Certain assets (such as trade accounts and inventory), will be circulating assets unless the secured party has ``control'' (which is defined under the PPS Act as including control within the ordinary

<<<

 meaning of that term) of the asset and registers that it has control on the PPSR. All other assets will be ``circulating assets'' only where the secured party has given the grantor express or implied authority to transfer the asset in the ordinary

<<<

 course of business free of the security interest.
Preferred creditor claims (for example, employee entitlements, auditor's fees and administrator's indemnity for costs) will have priority over the holder of a circulating security interest under

<<<

 the Australian Corporations Act.
A liquidator can apply to set aside a circulating security interest that was granted in the six months leading up to the liquidator's appointment, unless the company establishes that it was solvent immediately

<<<

 after granting the security interest, or that the security interest:
 secures an advance paid to the company (or interest on such advance), at or after that time and as consideration for the circulating security interest (subject to limited

<<<

 exceptions);
 secures the amount of a liability under a guarantee or other obligation undertaken at or after that time on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the company; or
308

 secures an amount payable for property or services supplied

<<<

 to the company (or interest of such an amount) at or after that time (unless the amount payable exceeds the market value of the property or services when supplied to the company).
Guarantees--liability to be set aside
A ``transaction'' for

<<<

 the purposes of the voidable transaction legislation is given a wide meaning and includes a guarantee given by a body. Under Australian law, a guarantee given by a company may also be set aside on a number of other grounds. For example, a guarantee

<<<

 may be unenforceable against a guarantor if the directors of the guarantor did not comply with their duties to act in good faith for the benefit of the guarantor and for a proper purpose in giving the guarantee. The issue is particularly relevant

<<<

 where a company provides a guarantee in relation to the obligations of another member of its corporate family, as is the case for the guarantees given by the Australian Guarantors with respect to the Notes. However, a director of a wholly-owned

<<<

 subsidiary is taken to act in good faith in the best interests of the subsidiary if the subsidiary's constitution expressly authorizes the director to act in the best interests of the holding company, the director acts in good faith in the

<<<

 best interests of the holding company and the subsidiary is not insolvent at the time the director acts and does not become insolvent because of the director's act.
In determining whether there is sufficient benefit, all relevant facts and

<<<

 circumstances of the transaction need to be considered by the directors, including the benefits and detriments to the Australian Guarantor in giving the guarantee, and the respective benefits to the other parties involved in the transaction

<<<

.
Whether a guarantee entered into in breach of directors' duties can be avoided against a party relying on the guarantee depends on certain factors, including the state of knowledge of that party, and whether the party knew of or suspected

<<<

 the breach. Under Australian law, a person is entitled to assume that the directors have properly performed their duties to the company unless that person knows or suspects that the assumption is incorrect.
Voidable transactions--consequences

<<<

 for the Noteholders
With respect to the Australian Guarantors, Noteholders will need to be mindful of the following:
 the security granted to the Noteholders may be at risk of being subject to an order that the new security is a voidable transaction

<<<

, should one or more of the Subsidiary Guarantors have an administrator or liquidator appointed to it within the relevant period(s) noted above following the grant of security for repayment of the Notes;
 if any of the guarantees from an Australian

<<<

 Guarantor is avoided, it is possible that Noteholders would be left with a claim solely against the Issuer and the other Subsidiary Guarantors and payments received from the relevant Australian Guarantor may need to be repaid; and
 pursuant

<<<

 to the C ro s s B o r d e r In s o lv e n c y A c t 2 0 0 8 of Australia, Australia adopted the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency (``Model Law''). The Model Law includes provisions for

<<<

 the co-operation of the Australian courts with representatives of foreign insolvency proceedings and provides for the facilitation of those insolvency proceedings in Australia.
Receivership
Receivers are typically appointed by a person to whom

<<<

 the company has granted security and acts as the company's agent. Their appointment and powers are usually governed by the terms of the security under which they are appointed, although they also have statutory powers in addition to the powers

<<<

 conferred under the security. The receiver's principal task is to take possession and control of the secured property and realize the property subject to the security and pay the proceeds to the security holder. A receiver would pay the net

<<<

 proceeds of sale to the appointing creditor (after paying prior security holders, other priority creditors, expenses and costs of receivership). Receivership is a regime implemented for the benefit of the secured creditor that appoints the

<<<

 receiver. In contrast, both administration and liquidation are regimes aimed at securing the best outcome for all of the company's creditors as a whole and the members.
The receiver's principal duty is to realize the secured property to preserve

<<<

 the value of the secured property pending its sale and to sell sufficient secured assets to satisfy the appointing creditor's
309

outstanding debt. A receiver has statutory and general law duties intended to, among other things, protect unsecured

<<<

 creditors (it owes residual duties to the company, unsecured creditors and shareholders, as an officer of the company). Receivers are under a duty when realizing security to obtain not less than market value or, where there is no market value

<<<

, the best price that is reasonably obtainable, having regard to the circumstances existing when the property is sold. Where a company grants security over an asset, the proceeds of enforcement must generally be remitted to the holder of the

<<<

 security, although certain claims in relation to the proceeds of circulating assets will rank in priority to the holder of the security (in accordance with section 433 of the Australian Corporations Act), as summarized below:
 if the proceeds

<<<

 are from contracts of insurance and the insurance policy is in respect of liability to third parties, the proceeds must be paid to the third party in respect of whom the liability was incurred;
 auditor's fees and expenses if ASIC has refused

<<<

 consent to the auditor's resignation for the period between the date of the refusal and the date the receiver was appointed;
 wages, superannuation contributions and superannuation guarantee charges payable by the company in respect of services

<<<

 rendered to the company by the employees prior to the date the receiver was appointed;
 all amounts due on or before the date the receiver is appointed in respect of leave of absence owing to employees;
 retrenchment payments; and
 all amounts

<<<

 which have been advanced by other parties to the company for the purpose of paying wages, superannuation contributions or payments in respect of leave of absence or termination of employment.
During a receivership, there is no moratorium in

<<<

 place and other creditors may pursue debts and claims against the company.
Security Interests over Australian property
The general law and various State and Commonwealth statutory regimes govern security interests over Australian property.

<<<

 The applicable law will depend on, among other things, the nature of the property the subject of the security.
Security over land
The most common security over land and interests in land in Australia takes the form of a legal mortgage. While

<<<

 legal mortgages under common law involve the transfer of legal title to the mortgagee, under the Torrens title regime adopted by each Australian State and Territory, title remains with the mortgagor. The Torrens title mortgage gains its status

<<<

 as a legal mortgage by virtue of registration on the applicable State or Territory register and the mortgagee is generally given the same rights (via statute) as a common law mortgagee. It is also possible to take an equitable mortgage over

<<<

 land (and a Torrens title mortgage which remains unregistered will operate as an equitable mortgage). However, an equitable mortgage will not enjoy the priority afforded to a legal mortgage. Torrens title mortgages can be granted over freehold

<<<

 and leasehold estates as well as over other mortgages.
There will be separate real property mortgages granted by Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited over the Albury site (in New South Wales) and Boyer site (in Tasmania), subject to

<<<

 the Agreed Security Principles, which will be registered at the relevant State land titles office (the ``Mortgages'').
Priority of Torrens title mortgages
The priority of a registered Torrens title mortgage will, broadly speaking (and in the

<<<

 absence of fraud), be subject to:
 any competing security interest which was registered at an earlier time; and
 certain claims preferred by applicable laws (discussed below).
310

This is similar to the general law position in relation

<<<

 to legal interests except that at general law, a legal interest will be subject to any prior interest of a third party of which the holder of the security interest had actual or constructive notice at the time of grant of the security interest

<<<

.
If any of the Mortgages are to be registered as second ranking in respect of any land, a priority arrangement with the first ranking mortgagee may be required to regulate, among other things, decision making, enforcement rights and the sharing

<<<

 of enforcement proceeds.
As noted above, if a Torrens title mortgage is not registered, it will take effect as an equitable mortgage and would be subject to, among other things:
 prior legal interests acquired for value without actual or constructive

<<<

 notice of the security and interests registered under the Torrens title regime with respect to the mortgaged property;
 prior equitable interests (with some exceptions);
 a later equitable interest if the mortgagee has engaged in postponing

<<<

 conduct (being conduct such as fraud or gross negligence which allowed the creation of the subsequent interest); and
 certain claims preferred by applicable laws (discussed below).
Claims which may be preferred under applicable laws (which

<<<

 are not specific to security over land) include:
 statutory charges which legislation provides will take priority over existing registered interests (such as a charge on the land to secure unpaid rates or land tax);
 claims relating to the

<<<

 taking of further advances, being rules which provide priority to a later security interest to the extent that the holder of the earlier security interest made subsequent advances in circumstances where it had notice of the later security 

<<<

(although there are a number of exceptions to this under general law and under some of the State and Territory Torrens title regimes);
 interests in relation to circulating Security Interests and floating charges (discussed above); and  in

<<<

 some cases, liens arising by operation of law.
Enforcement of Torrens title mortgages
Under the Mortgages, subject to any agreed priority arrangements, the Security Agent will be entitled to enforce the mortgages following a declared default

<<<

. It may need to give applicable statutory notices and wait until expiry of applicable grace periods.
Enforcement action available in relation to the Mortgages may include:  becoming a mortgagee-in-possession of the property;
 exercising a

<<<

 power of sale in respect of the property; or  appointing a receiver to the mortgagor.
Security over personal property under Australian law--overview of the PPS Act
B ackground
The PPS Act establishes a national regime for taking security over

<<<

 personal property. It applies to a security interest with a requisite connection to Australia. The PPS Act governs Security Interests over all kinds of personal property (with limited exceptions described below) and regardless of whether the

<<<

 person granting the security interest is a company or an individual.
A p p lic a tio n a n d te rm ino log y
Personal property under the PPS Act does not include land (including interests in fixtures) and certain statutory rights, licenses

<<<

 and entitlements that are declared not to be personal property for the purposes of the PPS Act (such as mining tenements and certain security interests in water rights). In addition, the PPS Act does not apply to various interests (such as

<<<

 rights of set-off and liens arising by operation of law). Security over property which is excluded from the PPS Act and any other security interests to which the PPS Act does not apply are governed by the general law and specific State and

<<<

 Territory legislation (such as the statutes in relation to Torrens title land).
311

The PPS Act defines Security Interests broadly and by using a functional approach. As a result, any transaction which creates an interest in personal property

<<<

 which secures payment or performance of an obligation will constitute a security interest (including transactions such as retention of title arrangements, turnover trusts and hire purchase arrangements). In addition, certain interests are deemed

<<<

 to be Security Interests regardless of whether they secure payment or performance of an obligation (such as the interest of a lessor under a PPS lease (which is, broadly, a lease of goods for a term of more than one year (or in the case of

<<<

 motor vehicles, aircraft or watercraft, for a term of more than 90 days)) or the assignee of certain receivables). As a result, many arrangements not traditionally considered to be Security Interests will appear on the Personal Property Securities

<<<

 Register (``PPSR'').
The PPS Act refers to the person who has granted the security interest as the `grantor' and property the subject of a security interest as `collateral'. The PPS Act includes rules relating to priority, the status of other

<<<

 competing interests, (known as the taking free rules, which are discussed below in relation to priority) and enforcement. The enforcement provisions do not apply to property of a company while a receiver or receiver and manager is appointed

<<<

 to it and do not affect a secured creditor's contractual or general law rights of enforcement.
P e rfe ctio n
In order to attain the best possible priority under the PPS Act and to prevent the security interest from vesting in the grantor on

<<<

 insolvency, a security interest must be perfected. The most common method of perfection is by registration of the security interest on the PpSr . Where the grantor is a company, a security interest which is perfected solely by registration

<<<

 must be registered within 20 business days after the relevant security agreement came into force or at least six months prior to the commencement of the winding up or administration of the company or the execution of a deed of company arrangement

<<<

 by the company. If those time limits are not complied with, the security interest remains subject to a vesting risk for 6 months after registration. If a security interest vests, the secured party loses its interest in the collateral. In practical

<<<

 terms the property which is the subject of a security interest which has vested in the grantor will be added to the pool of assets available to creditors of the grantor generally.
Other methods of perfection include taking possession or control

<<<

 of the collateral (in each case in accordance with the PPS Act). Those methods of perfection are only available in relation to specific types of property. Perfection by possession is only available for goods and certain other categories of

<<<

 personal property (such as certificated investment instruments). Perfection by control is only possible for certain types of financial property such as shares, units and bonds and, for a secured party that is an ADI, a bank accounts held with

<<<

 that ADI (discussed below). Security Interests perfected solely by possession or control will not appear on the PPSR.
Perfection can be lost if, for example, a secured party ceases to have possession or control of collateral (and did not also

<<<

 have a registration in respect of the interest).
The Security Interests which will arise under the general security deed to be granted over the assets of each of Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited, Norske Skog (Australasia) Pty Limited

<<<

 and Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited (the ``General Security Deed'') and the specific security deed to be granted over the shares of Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited will be perfected by registration on the PPSR. Security

<<<

 over the shares in the Australian Guarantors will also be perfected by control. To accomplish this, the Security Agent will retain the Australian Guarantors' share certificates and blank transfer forms for those shares signed by the security

<<<

 provider (but with the details of the transferee left blank) and in default situations would be able to transfer or otherwise deal with the shares. The ability to transfer the shares will be facilitated by the blank transfer forms.
C o m m

<<<

 in g lin g
If the Noteholders have a security interest in goods (for example, trees, pulp or recovered paper) that are later manufactured, processed or commingled with other goods so that their identity is lost in another product or mass, that

<<<

 security interest continues in the product or mass.
For the purposes of the default priority rules in the PPS Act, perfection of a security interest in goods that later become part of the product or mass is taken to be perfection of the security

<<<

 interest in the product or mass.
If a security interest is later granted over the product or mass as a whole, the PPS Act regulates priorities between security interests by providing that any priority that the continuing security interest has

<<<

 over another security interest in the product or mass is limited to the value of the goods on the day on which they became part of the product or mass.
312

If more than one security interest is granted over the goods before they are processed

<<<

 or commingled, a perfected security interest continuing in the product or mass will have priority over an unperfected security interest continuing in the same product or mass. If there is more than one perfected security interest continuing

<<<

 in the product or mass, each perfected security interest is entitled to share in the product or mass according to the ratio that the obligation secured by the perfected security interest bears to the sum of the obligations secured by all perfected

<<<

 security interests in the same product or mass. A similar regime applies in respect of unperfected security interests. For these purposes, the obligations secured by a security interest does not exceed the value of the goods on the day on which

<<<

 the goods became part of the product or mass. Perfected PMSIs (described below) in goods that continue in the product or mass have priority over non-PMSIs in such goods and non-PMSIs in the product or mass given by the same grantor.
Transfer

<<<

 o f c o lla te ra l in b re a c h o f the s e c u rity a g re e m e n t
Collateral under a security agreement can be transferred despite a prohibition in the relevant security agreement if the collateral would be able to be transferred but

<<<

 for the prohibition. However, such action does not otherwise prejudice the secured party's rights, including the right to call a default under the security agreement. In addition, the security interest will continue in the transferred collateral

<<<

 and will attach to any proceeds of the sale unless the security agreement provides otherwise (in each case, subject to the application of the taking free rules).
Nature of the General Security Deed
The General Security Deed will be prepared

<<<

 in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. It will be expressed to operate as something akin to a floating charge under common law over all revolving assets and to a fixed charge over all other secured property. This floating charge

<<<

 will become fixed upon the occurrence of an insolvency-type event or upon notice being given by the Security Agent following a declared default. To the extent the security granted by the General Security Deed is over real property, it will

<<<

 not create a mortgage that is capable of being registered on a real property register. Rather it will create a fixed charge over the real property that the Australian Guarantors are not entitled to deal in and a floating charge over the real

<<<

 property that the Australian Guarantors are entitled to deal in. Any such charge will rank behind any mortgage registered over the same property on a real property register. Similarly, the security interest over the personal property created

<<<

 by the General Security Deed will be second ranking to certain existing security that has been given by the Australian Guarantors.
Priority of the General Security Deed under the PPS Act
The PPS Act includes general default priority rules as

<<<

 well as specific rules in relation to certain types of Security Interests. Under those rules:
 perfected Security Interests take priority over unperfected Security Interests;
 priority as between perfected interests is determined by the time

<<<

 of perfection (subject to other specific rules including those listed below) and priority as between unperfected interests is determined by the time of attachment;
 subject to some exceptions, certain Security Interests which are purchase

<<<

 money security interests (each, a ``PMSI'') will take priority over Security Interests which are not PMSIs if the PMSI is registered within the timeframes specified in the PPS Act by a registration that indicates that it is a PMSI. A PMSI is

<<<

 a security interest in collateral that secures all or part of its purchase price (for example, a hire purchase agreement or retention of title arrangement) or a security interest where the secured party has provided value to enable the grantor

<<<

 to acquire the collateral. It also includes the interest of a lessor or bailor of goods under a PPS lease and the interest of a consignor under a commercial consignment;
 a security interest perfected by control will take priority over a Security

<<<

 Interest perfected by possession or registration (regardless of the time of creation or perfection of those other interests); and
 the priority afforded to a security interest will apply to all advances secured by that interest and secured

<<<

 parties may enter into agreements with each other to regulate the priority of their Security Interests which will override the position which would otherwise apply under the PPS Act.
313

Under the PPS Act, security held by an authorised deposit

<<<

 taking institution or ``ADI'' (which is a corporation authorised under the Banking Act 1959 of Australia and would cover most banks) over an account held with that institution is automatically perfected by control. This means that creditors

<<<

 with security over ADI accounts need to consider entering into contractual arrangements with the account bank in order to obtain priority for their interests. Other interests may take priority over PPS Act Security Interests, such as recipients

<<<

 of certain payments and acquirers of certain instruments and execution creditors, while certain claims are preferred on insolvency, such as those discussed above in relation to circulating Security Interests and floating charges.
Taking free

<<<

 rules under the PPS Act
There are also a number of circumstances in which a third party (such as a purchaser or lessee of collateral) can take the collateral free of a perfected security interest. These include (subject to exceptions) where

<<<

 the sale or lease is in the ordinary course of the grantor's business (unless the buyer or lessee actually knew it would breach the security agreement) and where a purchaser of shares or other investment instruments buys those instruments in

<<<

 the ordinary course of trading on a prescribed financial market.
In some circumstances, buyers and lessees can take free of Security Interests even where it is not in the ordinary course of the seller or lessor's business and the purchaser

<<<

 or lessee knows a security interest prohibiting the sale or lease exists. One example is where collateral which can be registered by serial number under the PPS Act (such as motor vehicles, watercraft, aircraft assets and certain intellectual

<<<

 property) is not registered by reference to that serial number (even if the security interest in this collateral is otherwise perfected).
Enforcement of the General Security Deed
Enforcement of Security Interests in Australia can generally

<<<

 be carried out by the holder of the security interest (or a person appointed by it) without court process. The General Security Deed will be able to be enforced following a declared default. Enforcement action may include taking possession

<<<

 of the secured property, exercising a power to sell the secured property or appointing a receiver or receiver and manager to manage and/or sell the secured property.
A receiver or receiver and manager appointed by a secured creditor will have

<<<

 certain powers which will be set out in the General Security Deed, as well as statutory powers, as discussed above. See ` `L im ita tio n s o n V a lid ity a n d E n fo r c e a b ility o f th e G u a ra n te e s a n d S e c u r ity In te re

Stamp duty
If the collateral the subject of the security is located in the State of New South Wales or taken to be located in the State of New South Wales for the purposes of applicable stamp

<<<

 duty legislation, an amount of mortgage duty will be payable on the relevant Security Documents on a proportional basis. To the extent that such stamp duty has not been paid (including any applicable penalties and interest), the Security Documents

<<<

 may not be enforceable in an Australian court and this may adversely affect the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security.
Austria
Insolvency law
One of the Guarantors, Norske Skog Bruck GmbH, is organized under the laws of Austria

<<<

, and has its centre of main interest in Austria or, at least has assets located in Austria (``Austrian Guarantor''). Therefore in the event of insolvency of the Austrian Guarantor insolvency proceedings governed by Austrian law, in particular

<<<

 by the Austrian Insolvency Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 337/1914 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 69/2014; In s o lv e n z o rd n u n g ), may be opened in Austria.
The Austrian Insolvency Act regulates on the one hand the liquidation

<<<

 proceedings concerning legal entities in which a debtor's assets or the company as a whole are sold and the resulting proceeds are distributed among its creditors. On the other hand it provides restructuring proceedings enabling the debtor

<<<

 to discharge its liabilities with quota payments and to continue its activities under certain conditions. The insolvency laws of Austria may not be as favorable to your interests as a creditor as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions.

<<<

 Your ability to recover payments due on the Notes under the
314

Austrian Insolvency Act may therefore be limited to a greater extent than under the insolvency laws governing other Guarantors or the Issuer.
The following is a brief description

<<<

 of certain aspects of Austrian insolvency law.
The Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung)
Insolvency proceedings (In s o lv e n z v e rfa h re n ) must be opened by the competent court upon application by the debtor or a creditor whenever

<<<

 a company is (i) illiquid (z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig ), i.e., unable to pay its debts in due time, (ii) or is over-indebted in terms of insolvency law (in s o lv e n z re c h tlic h u b e rs c h u ld e t), i.e., when the liabilities exceed

<<<

 its assets at liquidation values (re c h n e ris c h e U b e rs c h u ld u n g ) and the company has a negative prospect for its continued existence (n e g a tiv e F o rtb e s te h e n s p ro g n o s e ). In addition, restructuring proceedings

<<<

 (S a n ie ru n g s v e rfa h re n ) may also be initiated, if the risk of the debtor's inability to pay its debts is at least imminent (d ro h e n d e Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it) and the debtor files an application for the opening of

<<<

 such proceedings.
If a restructuring plan (S a n ie ru n g s p la n ) offering a quota of at least 20% to the unsecured creditors within a maximum of two years is presented together with the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings

<<<

, the insolvency proceedings will be initiated as restructuring proceedings; if no such restructuring plan is presented with the insolvency proceedings application, the insolvency proceedings will be initiated as bankruptcy proceedings (K o

<<<

 n k u rs v e rfa h re n ). A debtor may also present such a restructuring plan in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding whereby the bankruptcy proceeding will be continued as a restructuring proceeding.
Restructuring plans intend to discharge

<<<

 the debtor from a part of its debts (up to 80%) and to enable the debtor to continue its business activities. A qualified simple majority of unsecured creditors has to approve the restructuring plan. Qualified simple majority means a simple

<<<

 majority (in number) of unsecured creditors present at the hearing, representing more than 50% of the total sum of these unsecured creditors' claims present at the hearing. If the restructuring plan is accepted by the creditors, confirmed by

<<<

 the court and fulfilled by the debtor, the latter is released from the rest of its debts. If the debtor files qualified documents together with a restructuring plan offering a quota of at least 30% in its application for the opening of insolvency

<<<

 proceedings, the debtor is entitled to self administration under supervision of a restructuring administration (S a n ie ru n g s v e rfa h re n m it E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g u n te r A u fs ic h t e in e s V e rw a lte rs ). If the realization

<<<

 of a restructuring plan fails, the insolvency proceeding will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings.
Unless the debtor meets the requirements for self administration, the debtor is not any longer in the position to dispose assets subject to

<<<

 insolvency (In s o lv e n z m a s s e ) as of the opening of insolvency proceedings. The opening takes effect as of 12:00 a.m. of the day following the publication of the receiving order in the official insolvency data base (www.edikte.justiz

<<<

.gv.at). Legal acts of the debtor in relation to the debtor's assets take no effect towards the creditors after the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Unless the debtor meets the requirements for self administration, the court appoints an

<<<

 insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r) along with its decision on the opening of the insolvency proceedings, and, if it deems this necessary in view of the size of the debtor's business, a creditors' committee (G la u b ig

<<<

 e ra u s s c h u s s ) to assist the insolvency administrator. After the opening of insolvency proceedings without self administration (bankruptcy proceedings or restructuring proceedings) only the insolvency administrator is entitled to act

<<<

 on behalf of the debtor's estate.
The insolvency administrator's main task is to administer and realize the assets of the debtor's estate effectively. According to Austrian insolvency law, the insolvency administrator shall continue the debtor

<<<

's business in order to enable a potential reorganization of the debtor's business either by realizing the debtor's restructuring plan (which he may also apply for during the bankruptcy proceedings) or by selling the debtor's business. If neither

<<<

 a restructuring plan nor the sale of the debtor's business is possible, the insolvency administrator will break up the company and the bankruptcy proceedings will ultimately lead to the sale and distribution of the debtor's assets and the debtor

<<<

 will remain liable for its residual debts. If the debtor meets the requirements for self administration, the debtor is monitored by a restructuring administrator (S a n ie ru n g s v e rw a lte r) appointed by the court to whom certain transactions

<<<

 are reserved.
Unsecured creditors (In s o lv e n z g la u b ig e r) must file their claims with the competent court within the time period set out in the court order on the opening of insolvency proceedings (usually two months). At the examination

<<<

 hearing (P ru fu n g s ta g s a tz u n g ), which is held by the competent court, the insolvency administrator must declare whether he acknowledges or contests a claim filed by unsecured creditors. If
315

the insolvency administrator acknowledges

<<<

 a creditor's claim, the creditor is entitled to participate in the insolvency proceeding, which means that such creditor will receive the quota that is distributed to the unsecured creditors. If a creditor's claim is contested by the insolvency

<<<

 administrator, the creditor must assert its claim in civil proceedings in order to maintain its right to participate in the insolvency proceedings.
Claims of unsecured creditors in insolvency proceedings, which were created before the opening

<<<

 of the proceedings, rank p a r i p a s s u . Taxes, social security contributions, wages and salaries are not, as such, privileged or preferential claims under Austrian insolvency law. Claims which lawfully arose against the debtor's estate

<<<

 after the opening of the proceedings, so called privileged claims (M a s s e fo rd e ru n g e n ) or claims which are secured by collateral (e.g., by a mortgage, a pledge over bank accounts or shares, an assignment of receivables for security

<<<

 purposes or a security transfer of moveable assets), so called preferential claims (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h te ), enjoy priority in insolvency proceedings. Creditors of preferential claims have a right to preferential satisfaction from

<<<

 the proceeds of the realization of the assets serving as collateral, thereby excluding unsecured creditors. However, such secured creditors may participate in the pro rata distribution only to the extent that the proceeds from the realization

<<<

 of the collateral issued to them did not cover their claims or if they have waived their right to preferential treatment. Secured creditors do not have a voting right on the restructuring plan to the extent their claim is covered by security

<<<

.
The costs of the insolvency proceedings and certain liabilities accrued during insolvency proceedings rank prior to all other claims. Creditors with a right of separation of assets (A u s s o n d e ru n g s b e re c h tig te ), such as creditors

<<<

 with retention of title, remain unaffected by the opening of insolvency proceedings though they may be barred from exercising their rights for a maximum period of six months following the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the exercise of

<<<

 such rights would endanger the carrying on of the debtor's business and the interdiction does not cause severe personal or economic damage to the secured creditor. The same applies for secured creditors of preferential claims
(A b son de ru

<<<

 ng sb erech tigte).
Once formal insolvency proceedings have been opened, creditors cannot satisfy their claims by obtaining an execution lien against the assets of the debtor. All execution proceedings against the debtor are stayed (V o lls

<<<

 tre c k u n g s s p e rre ). Execution liens obtained within 60 days prior to the opening of formal proceedings expire. A contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from the agreement or for an automatic termination in the

<<<

 event of opening of insolvency proceedings against the other party is not enforceable. However, this provision does not apply to certain agreements listed in section 20 (4) of the Austrian Insolvency Act.
Austrian law also provides for certain

<<<

 creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration).
Powers of attorney granted by the relevant

<<<

 debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.
The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz)
The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Federal Law

<<<

 Gazette No. 114/1997 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 58/2010; U n te rn e h m e n s re o rg a n is a tio n s g e s e tz ) governs business reorganizations, which are designed to enable businesses in temporary financial distress to

<<<

 continue their business after having undergone a reorganization procedure. Only the debtor may apply for the opening of such a procedure, provided that the debtor is still solvent at the time of its application and is faced with the urgent

<<<

 need for reorganisation (R e o rg a n is a tio n s b e d a rf). The urgent need for reorganisation is statutorily presumed if both the quota of own funds (E ig e n m itte lq u o te ) is less than 8% and the fictitious duration of debt redemption

<<<

 (fik tiv e S c h u ld e n tilg u n g s d a u e r) exceeds 15 years. Contractual provisions that stipulate a termination right in the event of reorganization proceedings are invalid.
The right of avoidance (contestation) in the event of insolvency

<<<

 proceedings
Legal actions and legal transactions that have taken place within certain suspect periods prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings may be subject to an avoidance claim by the insolvency administrator according to the Austrian

<<<

 Insolvency Act. Basic requirements of such avoidance are: (i) the successful avoidance must result in an increase of the debtor's estate (B e frie d ig u n g s ta u g lic h k e it); (ii) the
316

challenged legal action or challenged legal

<<<

 transaction took place within a certain ``hardening'' period (which vary from 60 days to 10 years depending on the parties involved in the contested legal action or transaction) and must have caused a direct or indirect discrimination of the

<<<

 other creditors (G la u b ig e rb e n a c h te ilig u n g ); and (iii) the avoidance claim must be filed by the insolvency administrator within one year after the opening of the insolvency proceedings.
In particular, the following legal transactions

<<<

 and legal acts are voidable:
 Avoidance due to intended discrimination ( A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n B e n a c h te ilig u n g s a b s ic h t) : Transactions concluded by the debtor in order to discriminate other creditors may be challenged

<<<

, if they were entered within 10 years preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings and the other party knew about the debtor's intention to discriminate. In the event that a transaction has a discriminatory effect on other creditors and

<<<

 the contractual counter party should have been aware of this effect, the period is shortened to two years prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings. If the legal act was concluded with close relatives (relatives, in-laws) the transaction

<<<

 may be challenged, unless the relative can prove that he or she did not have, and was not negligent in not having, knowledge of the debtor's discriminatory intent (i.e. the burden of proof is shifted to the relative). Should the debtor be a

<<<

 legal entity with the capacity to be party to legal proceedings, members of the managing and supervisory bodies of the debtor as well as the debtor's shareholders with unlimited liability and as the debtor's controlling shareholders or shareholders

<<<

 with a participation of at least 25% are deemed to be close relatives.
 Avoidance due to squandering of assets ( A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n V e rm o g e n s v e rs c h le u d e ru n g ): Avoidance may apply to certain contracts, including

<<<

 purchase and exchange contracts, entered into by the debtor that are considered a squandering of assets at the expense of other creditors, if the counterparty had, or should have had, knowledge of such squandering. Squandering of assets is

<<<

 assumed if an obvious incongruity exists between the performance and the consideration. Transactions that took place within one year prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings are effected in case of squandering.
 Avoidance of transactions

<<<

 without consideration and analogous transactions (A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n u n e n tg e ltlic h e r o d e r ih n e n g le ic h g e s te llte r V e rfu g u n g e n ): Dispositions of the debtor that were concluded without consideration or

<<<

 are equivalent to such dispositions may be challenged if concluded within two years prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Examples for such dispositions are: donations, acknowledgement of debt, collateralisation of existing liabilities

<<<

 and payment of someone else's debt. If the debtor receives any economic benefit or interest in return considered as adequate consideration (a n g e m e s s e n e s E n tg e lt) the disposition may not be challenged.
 Avoidance due to preferential

<<<

 treatment (A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n B e g u n s tig u n g ): The payment of or the granting of security to a creditor ( B e frie d ig u n g o d e r S ic h e rs te llu n g ) after or within 60 days prior to a material insolvency or application

<<<

 for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter may be avoided if (i) the creditor obtained security or satisfaction to which it was not, or not in that way or at that time, entitled, unless it was not favored by this transaction (objective

<<<

 preferential treatment) or (ii) the creditor knew or should have known that the debtor acted with the intention to privilege the creditor (subjective preferential treatment) or (iii) the creditor is a close relative, unless such relative can

<<<

 prove that he or she did not have, and was not negligent in not having, knowledge of the debtor's discriminatory intent. Material insolvency means illiquidity or over-indebtedness in terms of insolvency law. Objective preferential treatment

<<<

 does not require any subjective elements on part of the counterparty; in particular the counterparty's knowledge of the financial condition of the debtor is irrelevant. Subjective preferential treatment requires the debtor's intention to favor

<<<

 a creditor and the creditor's knowledge of the debtor's intention. Such transactions carried out more than one year before the opening of the insolvency proceedings may not be contested.
 Avoidance due to knowledge of material insolvency 

<<<

(A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n K e n n tn is d e r Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it): Legal acts carried out after material insolvency or after application for the opening of insolvency proceedings could be subject to appeal, if the legal act

<<<

 (i) constitutes the payment of or the granting of security to a creditor or (ii) is considered to be a directly or indirectly disadvantageous transaction (n a c h te ilig e s R e c h ts g e s c h a ft). Legal acts by which a creditor's claim

<<<

 is satisfied or secured may only be challenged, if the creditor knew or was negligent in not knowing of the material insolvency or pending insolvency application.
317

A transaction is considered disadvantageous where the chances of satisfaction

<<<

 of the claims of the other creditors are worsened due to the transaction or if such agreements are directly disadvantageous to other creditors and the contracting partner knew or should have known of the debtor's material insolvency or pending

<<<

 insolvency application.
Disadvantageous transactions of the debtor concluded with non-creditors may be challenged if such agreements are either directly or indirectly disadvantageous to creditors, but only if the contracting partner (i) knew

<<<

 or should have known of the debtor's material insolvency or pending insolvency application and (ii) the disadvantage for the insolvency estate was objectively predictable at the time of the transaction; in particular when a restructuring plan

<<<

 is obviously inappropriate (o ffe n s ic h tlic h
u n ta u g lich e s S a nierungskonzept).
A transaction is considered indirectly disadvantageous (s o n s t n a c h te ilig ) if the transaction is objectively balanced, i.e. not directly disadvantageous

<<<

 but the transaction nonetheless lowers the recovery rate of creditors. In case of an indirectly disadvantageous transaction the contracting partner must prove that the disadvantage to the insolvency estate was objectively unpredictable. If

<<<

 the contracting partner and thus beneficiary of the satisfaction/securing or disadvantageous act is a close relative, he or she must in addition prove that he or she had, and was not negligent in having, no knowledge of the debtor's illiquidity

<<<

 or insolvency petition.
In addition, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (V o lls tre c k u n g s tite l) could possibly also avoid any transactions according to the Austrian Avoidance Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 337/1914 as last

<<<

 amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 29/2010; A n fe c h tu n g s o rd n u n g ) outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions for such action vary to a certain extent from the rules described above, and the avoidance periods are calculated

<<<

 from the date when such other creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.
Perfection of Share Pledge
Pursuant to Austrian law, the creation of a valid (contractual) pledge requires both a contractual basis for the pledge (the

<<<

 so-called title) and perfection of the pledge (the so-called mode). While the pledge agreement between the pledgor and the pledgee constitutes the title, the relevant mode for perfection depends on the type of asset to be pledged. A pledge

<<<

 over shares in an Austrian limited liability company (G e s e lls c h a ft m it b e s c h ra n k te r H a ftu n g ) may be perfected by serving a written notification of the pledge on the company the shares of which are pledged. In addition

<<<

, the pledge over the shares should be recorded in the pledgor's books and accounts (B u c h v e rm e rk ) so as to ensure that any person inspecting such books and accounts easily becomes aware of the pledge over the shares. No valid and enforceable

<<<

 security interest is created until the share pledge is appropriately perfected. The enforcement of a pledge over shares in an Austrian limited liability company will be subject to mandatory provisions of Austrian law which aim at protecting

Subsidiary Guarantee
C o rp o ra te la w c a p ita l m a in te n a n ce rules
The enforcement of upstream and cross stream guarantees provided by the Austrian Guarantor are limited by strict capital maintenance rules imposed by Austrian corporate

<<<

 law, including the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 98/1965 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 40/2014; A k tie n g e s e tz ) and the Austrian Act on Limited Liability Companies (Federal Law Gazette No. 58/1

<<<

906 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 13/2014; G e s e tz u b e r G e s e lls c h a fte n m it b e s c h ra n k te r H a ftu n g ). These rules protect the entire assets of an Austrian Guarantor on behalf of their respective creditors

<<<

. The entire set of corporate assets, even those exceeding the stated capital, falls under the capital maintenance rules. Shareholder distributions by an Austrian Guarantor may only be made under explicitly specified conditions. Accordingly

<<<

 shareholders have the right to receive dividend payments only if these payments are restricted to the amount of net profits shown in the approved annual financial statements and not prohibited by law or the respective subsidiary's articles

<<<

 of association and further provided that the shareholder(s) resolved on the disbursement of such dividend payment.
An Austrian Guarantor may not make any other asset-reducing payments to a group company (not being a direct or indirect subsidiary

<<<

), except (i) in the context of repayments within the scope of stated
318

capital decreases, or (ii) payments and distributions within the scope of a permitted arm's length transaction. Any distributions or payments to an affiliated company

<<<

 (not being a direct or indirect subsidiary; respectively to a third party to the benefit of such an affiliated company) without an adequate consideration would be considered as a violation of the Austrian capital maintenance rules.
A violation

<<<

 of Austrian capital maintenance rules by an Austrian Guarantor would result in the invalidity of the relevant transaction between the Austrian Guarantor and the shareholder (or between the Austrian Guarantor and a third party if the transaction

<<<

 has been undertaken by an Austrian Guarantor for the benefit of its shareholder e.g. by providing an upstream or cross stream guarantee for the financing to the parent company).
Austrian capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court

<<<

 decisions. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the enforceability of the guarantees, which could negatively affect its ability to make payment on the Notes offered hereby or the ability of the subsidiaries to

<<<

 make payments on the guarantees.
Irrespective of considerations of Austrian capital maintenance rules, the recoverability under certain Guarantees granted by the Australian Guarantor may be limited owing to the subordination and other factors

The Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Federal Law Gazette No. 92/2003 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 5

<<<

8/2010; E ig e n k a p ita le rs a tz g e s e tz ) contains detailed provisions regarding specific circumstances in which shareholder loans are considered as company equity. In particular, loans granted by a shareholder in a financial crisis

<<<

 (i.e. the subsidiary is insolvent, over-indebted or the requirements of a business reorganization procedure are met) are deemed to be equity replacing. In a financial crisis, equity replacing shareholder loans may not be repaid and any security

<<<

 interest granted in connection with such loans may not be enforced. This means that in insolvency proceedings, respective claims are subordinated (i.e. there is no right for separation (A u s s o n d e ru n g s re c h t) or a right for separate

<<<

 satisfaction (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h t)). A shareholder is, according to the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements, (i) a shareholder with controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any

<<<

 person not holding a participation in the company but having a controlling influence ( b e h e rr s c h e n d e r E in flu s s ).
Furthermore, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered as shareholder if (i) it holds participation

<<<

 or other rights in a third person which has a controlling influence regarding the company granted the loan/credit, (ii) it indirectly holds at least 33% of the participation rights in the company granted the loan/credit or (iii) it holds controlling

<<<

 direct or indirect participation rights in a company which holds at least 25% of the participation rights in the company granted the loan/credit.
Prior to the enactment of the Act on Equity Replacements the Austrian Supreme Court had developed

<<<

 even stricter rules on equity replacing shareholder loans compared to the rules stipulated in the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements. In this context, it is uncertain whether the rules on equity replacing shareholder loans also apply to (controlling

Under Austrian law, certain accessory security interests such as pledges

<<<

 require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The Noteholders will not be party to the security documents relating to the Collateral

<<<

. In order for the Noteholders to benefit from security interests under accessory Collateral, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a parallel debt. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Trustee becomes the holder

<<<

 of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes and the Guarantees. The pledges governed by Austrian law will directly secure the parallel debt. The parallel debt concept as such is not known under Austrian law and a parallel

<<<

 debt governed by a foreign law has not been tested under Austrian law, and there is accordingly no certainty that it will be held enforceable under Austrian law.

According

<<<

 to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 79/1896 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 69/2014; E x e k u tio n s o rd n u n g ), foreign judgments are only enforceable in Austria if the reciprocity is warranted by a bilateral

<<<

 or multilateral treaty between the countries involved or by a respective directive (V e ro rd n u n g ) of the Austrian government. The Republic of Austria and the United States have not entered into a treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition

<<<

 and enforcement of judgments rendered in either court in civil and commercial matters. In this regard, there is also no directive of the Austrian government in place. Therefore, the courts of Austria will not recognize and/or enforce a judgment

<<<

 obtained in the courts of the United States, be it a judgment rendered by a United States federal or state court. Accordingly, the subject matter upon which a judgment has been obtained in a United States federal or state court must be re-litigated

<<<

 before Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian Civil Procedure Laws (Z iv ilp ro z e s s v e rfa h re n ). A judgment by a federal state court of the United States will be regarded by an Austrian court only as evidence of the

<<<

 outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates, and an Austrian court has to re-hear the dispute. Only after having obtained a final judgment before an Austrian court can enforcement procedures be initiated under the Austrian Enforcement

<<<

 Act.
D ire c to r in fa c t
A person granted the rights of information and control that actually influences the management of an Austrian Guarantor could, depending on the extent of such rights granted and the actual use of such rights, qualify

<<<

 as a director in fact (fa k tis c h e r G e s c h a fts fu h re r). The director in fact has the same obligations and liability as a regular director appointed in accordance with applicable Austrian corporate law. Therefore a person qualifying

<<<

 as such could be liable for any acts made in connection with the management of the company; in particular towards the company and the creditors of the company.
Banking law restrictions
The Austrian Banking Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 532/

<<<

1993 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 59/2014; B a n k w e s e n g e s e tz ) regulates certain banking activities. Companies may in general only conduct these banking activities on a commercial basis (g e w e r b lic h ) if they have

<<<

 been granted a banking license by the Austrian financial market authority (F in a n z m a rk ta u fs ic h ts b e h o rd e ). In addition, the Austrian Securities Supervision Act 2007 (Federal Law Gazette No. 60/2007 as last amended by Federal

<<<

 Law Gazette No. 59/2014; W e rtp a p ie ra u fs ic h ts g e s e tz 2 0 0 7 ), regulates certain activities which qualify as investment services and investment activities; such activities include the reception and transmission of orders in relation

<<<

 to one or more financial instruments, portfolio management and investment advice. Entities may in general only conduct such regulated activities on a commercial basis if they have either been granted a banking license or an investment service

<<<

 license by the Austrian financial market authority.
Besides any entity licensed by the Austrian supervisory authority to conduct regulated activities within the meaning of the Austrian Banking Act and the Austrian Securities Supervision Act

<<<

 also credit institutions or investment firms, respectively authorized in a member state of the European Economic Area, may conduct certain of the regulated activities in Austria. Such entity may conduct the relevant activities in Austria either

<<<

 by an established branch office or by way of the freedom to provide services, insofar as such activities are authorized under the legal provisions of the Member State of incorporation and the relevant notification procedure in line with the

<<<

 European law directive 2013/36/EU or the European law directive 2004/39/EC as amended and the relevant local laws have been complied with.
Accordingly, any entity which intends to conduct activities on a commercial basis regulated by the Austrian

<<<

 Banking Act or the Austrian Securities Supervision Act in Austria or from outside of Austria into Austria, requires a respective license or successful completion of EEA notification procedures. Conducting such regulated activities in Austria

<<<

 without the necessary license or successful completion of EEA notification procedures can trigger administrative fines and civil law sanctions. The Austrian Banking Act provides that whoever conducts (a) banking services set out in Art 4 (

<<<

1) (1) of EU regulation 575/2013 without the required authorization is guilty of an administrative offence and may be subject to an administrative fine of up to EUR 5 million or up to twice the value of the economic benefit derived from such

<<<

 violation if not qualified as a criminal offense; or (b) other banking/investment services without the required authorization is guilty of an administrative offence and may be subject to an administrative fine of up to EUR 100,000, if not qualified

<<<

 as a criminal offense. A monetary penalty of up to EUR 100,000 is also set forth in the Austrian Securities Supervision Act for conducting certain activities
320

mentioned therein without the necessary license, if not qualified as a criminal

<<<

 offense. Furthermore, whoever conducts such regulated activities unlicensed shall not be entitled to any compensation connected with such activities (interests, commissions, fees, etc.) though the concluded transaction agreements remain valid

<<<

. Sureties (B u rg s c h a fte n ) and guarantees granted in connection therewith on the other side are ineffective. In addition, civil lawsuits for unfair competition by competitors are possible.
Stamp duty
Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act

<<<

 (Federal Law Gazette No. 267/1957 as last amended by Federal Gazette No. 13/2014; G e b u h re n g e s e tz ), stamp duty is triggered upon the creation of a document (U rk u n d e ; a term which has a specific technical meaning within the

<<<

 context of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act) on certain dutiable transactions enumerated in the Austrian Stamp Duty Act. Dutiable transactions include e.g., lease agreements, sureties, assignments and mortgages. Stamp duty on loan and credit agreements

<<<

 has been abolished as of January 1, 2011.
According to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, stamp duty amounts in the case of:
(a) sureties (B u rg s c h a ft) are 1% of the secured amount (a guarantee may be treated as a surety for stamp duty purposes

<<<

, if the guarantor under the guarantee does not explicitly waive all claims, remedies or defenses with respect to the underlying guaranteed transaction and the guarantee is not considered to be abstract); and
(b) assignments are 0.8% of the

<<<

 consideration, or 0.8% of the secured amount in case of an assignment for security (S ic h e ru n g s z e s s io n ); however, not more than the assigned receivables.
Dutiable transactions relating to the granting of security (in particular

<<<

 sureties, assignments, mortgages) may be exempt from stamp duty, if such transaction (exclusively) secures claims under a loan or credit agreement.
Austrian stamp duty is basically triggered if a document on a dutiable transaction is created

<<<

 in Austria. Irrespective of the country of document creation, stamp duty may be triggered if (i) the transaction parties' (habitual) residence, seat, (factual) management or place of business is located in Austria and (ii) the transaction concerns

<<<

 an asset situated in Austria or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to perform under the transaction in Austria.
If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be triggered

<<<

 if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is imported into Austria and (i) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria, or (ii

<<<

) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or official use of the document (or a certified copy thereof).
Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a dutiable transaction in a qualified

<<<

 manner (so called confirming document; r e c h ts b e z e u g e n d e U rk u n d e ). A confirming document within the present context is constituted if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be derived from the document

<<<

. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties and sent to the other party or its representative (or even a testifying third party). Accordingly, any notices, references, confirmations, reports, protocols

<<<

 or correspondence (including e-mails) containing information on the parties' rights and obligations could constitute confirming documentation. Further, stamp duty may be triggered by a so called substitute document (E rs a tz u rk u n d e 

<<<

) on a dutiable transaction or a document that incorporates by reference a document on a dutiable transaction; e.g. a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction.
If Austrian stamp duty is triggered the parties to the transaction are jointly

<<<

 and severally liable; unless only one party is obliged to perform under the relevant transaction, then the party in whose interest the document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g. the creditor in case of a surety). Other persons

<<<

 involved in the transaction (as well as certain persons, if they violate their responsibility to notify the competent tax authorities in this regard) are secondarily liable for the triggered stamp duty. Agreements between the parties as to

<<<

 who shall bear the stamp duty are not relevant for the tax authorities but may be honored within their discretion.
If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a dutiable transaction, the

<<<

 competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the stamp duty up to 100% depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that the stamp duty was triggered, the
321

notification was made with slight or substantial delay

<<<

 or provisions of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act had been infringed for the first time or repeatedly.
Appointment of a trustee (Kurator)

<<<

 initiated over an issuer's assets in Austria provide that noteholders cannot exercise their rights under the notes on their own behalf but only collectively via a trustee (K u ra to r) appointed by the competent court for all noteholders, if

<<<

 the noteholders rights are endangered or a third party's rights are delayed due to a lack of common representation of the noteholders. Following an appointment of such a court-appointed trustee, neither the Trustee for the Notes nor individual

<<<

 Noteholders will have the power to instruct the Security Agent to the extent such instructions relate to the collective rights of the Noteholders. No assurance can be given that such powers will vest in the court appointed trustee, and, even

<<<

 if they vest in the court appointed trustee, that the court-appointed trustee will exercise its powers in accordance with the best interests of the Noteholders.

The following is a general description of certain aspects of the prevention

 to the holders of the Notes below include the holders of the Notes acting through, or in place of, the Issuer with respect to the Collateral or the Guarantees, as applicable.
French laws and proceedings affecting creditors include debt rescheduling

 pursuant to Articles 1244-1 e t s e q . of the French Civil Code (C o d e c iv il), m a n d a t a d h o c proceedings (m a n d a ts a d h o c ) , conciliation proceedings (p r o c e d u r e d e c o n c ilia tio n ) , safeguard proceedings

<<<

 judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (re d re s s e m e n t or liq u id a tio n ju d ic ia ir e ) . In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and the protection of employment over the payment

 of creditors.
Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, if a debtor is located in the European Union (other than Denmark), French courts shall have jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the center of the debtor's main interests is

<<<

 situated in France. In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the ``center of its main interests'' in the absence of proof to the contrary. In determining whether the ``center of main

<<<

 interests'' of a company is in France, French courts will take into account a broad range of factual elements.
French insolvency law was last modified by Ordinances n 2014-326 dated March 12, 2014, Ordinance 2014-1088 dated September 26, 

<<<

2014 and Decree No 2014-736 dated July 1, 2014 that entered into force on July 1, 2014.
Grace periods
In addition to the pre-insolvency and insolvency laws discussed below, the holders of the Notes could, like any other creditors, be subject

<<<

 to Articles 1244-1 e t s e q . of the French Civil Code (C o d e c iv il).
Pursuant to Articles 1244-1 e t s e q . of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or

<<<

 the creditor, taking into account the debtor's financial position and the creditor's financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations over a maximum period of two years and decide that any amounts, the

<<<

 payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate set by the French Central Bank (B a n q u e d e F ra n c e ), which is 0.04% per

<<<

 annum in respect of year 2014) or that payments made shall first be allocated to the repayment of principal. If a court order under Articles 1244-1 e t s e q . of the French Civil Code is made, it will suspend any pending enforcement measures

<<<

, and any contractual interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the court. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods. When the debtor benefits from a conciliation proceeding, these

<<<

 statutory provisions shall be read in combination with Article L.611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see ``--C o n c ilia tio n
P ro c e e d in g s " ).

Insolvency test
Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (e n e

Mandat ad hoc and

<<<

 conciliation proceedings
A French company facing difficulties without being cash flow insolvent (or for less than 45 days in the case of conciliation proceedings) may request the opening of court-assisted proceedings (m a n d a t a d h o c

<<<

 or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor's main creditors and stakeholders e.g. agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. These proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in

<<<

 its sole discretion. M a n d a t a d h o c and conciliation are informal and confidential (subject to the below) proceedings carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (m a n d a ta ire a d h o c or c o n c ilia te u r, whose

<<<

 name can be suggested by the debtor) itself under the supervision of the President of the relevant court (usually the Commercial Court), which do not involve any stay of the claims nor pending proceedings. As a consequence, creditors are not

<<<

 barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they usually accept to do so for the duration of the proceedings. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a

<<<

 grace period (in conciliation proceedings the President of the court), as set forth above and below. In conciliation proceedings, the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliator (Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code

<<<

).
M a n d a t a d h o c and conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of the participating creditors has been sought to prepare the sale of all or part of the business of the debtor with a

<<<

 view to implement such sale (p la n d e c e s s io n ) in a subsequent insolvency proceeding. To ensure transparency, the public prosecutor must be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such conciliation proceeding.
Contractual

<<<

 provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of a m a n d a ta ire a d h o c or the opening of conciliation proceedings

<<<

, or any request made to this end are deemed null and void.
Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of a m a n d a t a d h o c proceedings or the opening of conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear

<<<

 the fees of the creditor's counsel relating to such proceedings for the portion that would exceed three quarters of the total fee of the relevant counsel are null and void.
Mandat ad hoc proceedings
French law does not provide for any specific

<<<

 rule in respect of m a n d a t a d h o c proceedings, except that these proceedings (i) are confidential by law (save for their disclosure for statutory auditors if any) and (ii) may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole

<<<

 discretion. M a n d a t a d h o c proceedings are not limited in time and are informal proceedings carried out under the supervision of the president of the relevant court (usually the Commercial Court), which do not involve any stay of the

<<<

 proceedings.
A company that is facing any type of difficulties (but which is not insolvent; see ``--In s o lv e n c y Test" above) may request from the President of the court the appointment of a m a n d a ta ire a d h o c , whose name it can

<<<

 suggest. The m a n d a ta ire a d h o c 's duties are determined by the court. Such m a n d a ta ire a d h o c is usually appointed in order to facilitate negotiations with the debtor's main creditors but he cannot coerce the creditors into

<<<

 accepting any proposal. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help of such m a n d a ta ire a d h o c can be reported by the latter to the president of the court but is not approved by the court. The restructuring agreement

<<<

 between the company and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement.
Conciliation proceedings
A French company may, in its sole

<<<

 discretion, apply for the opening of conciliation proceedings, provided it (i) is not insolvent (see ``--In s o lv e n c y Test" above), or has been insolvent for fewer than 45 days and (ii) experiences current or predictable legal, economic

<<<

 or financial difficulties. The debtor petitions the president of the Commercial Court for the appointment of a conciliator (whose name it can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating with some or all of its creditors and/or

<<<

 trade
323

partners an agreement that provides for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings are confidential and may last up to five months. During the proceedings, creditors may continue to sue individually for payment

<<<

 of their claims but they usually in practice accept not to do so. In addition, the debtor retains the right to petition the president of the Commercial Court for a grace period.
With regard to the grace periods under Articles 1244-1 of the

<<<

 French Civil Code, the judge having opened conciliation proceedings (i) may grant a grace period even when the formal notice asking the debtor to pay was sent before conciliation proceedings commenced (and not only during conciliation proceedings

<<<

) and (ii) may grant a grace period during the implementation of the conciliation agreement (and not only during conciliation proceedings).
This agreement may be either acknowledged (c o n s ta te ) by the president of the court or approved

<<<

 (h o m o lo g u e ) by the court.
While the agreement (whether acknowledged or approved) is being implemented, by law (i) any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims included in the agreement are suspended, (ii) accrued

<<<

 interest of the claims governed by the restructuring agreement cannot bear themselves interest (notwithstanding Article 1154 of the French Civil Code) and (iii) the debtor retains the right to petition the President of the Court who opened

<<<

 conciliation proceedings for debt rescheduling (pursuant to Article 1244-1 of the French Civil Code mentioned above) in relation to claims of non-consenting creditors (other than public creditors) who were called to the conciliation, in which

<<<

 case the decision would be taken after having heard the c o n c ilia to r appointed to supervise the performance of the restructuring agreement (m a n d a ta ire a l 'e x e c u tio n d e I 'a c c o r d ) , and taking into account the actual

<<<

 implementation of the restructuring agreement by the debtor.
The conciliator acting as ``m a n d a ta ire a I 'e x e c u tio n d e I 'a c c o r d " may monitor the implementation of the conciliation agreement, when the conciliation agreement

<<<

 is approved by the Court.
The acknowledgement of the agreement by the president of the court upon all parties' request, gives the agreement the legal force of a final judgment, which means that it constitutes a judicial title that can be enforced

<<<

 by the parties without further recourse to a judge (titre e x e c u to ire ), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.
The conciliation agreement can also be approved by the court upon the debtor's request. The approval by the

<<<

 Court, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, will make the existence of the conciliation proceedings public (not the content of the agreement--save for the information of the employees' representatives if any) will have

<<<

 the following specific consequences:
 creditors who provided new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) in the course of conciliation

<<<

 proceedings leading to an approved conciliation agreement or in application of an approved conciliation agreement will have priority of payment over all pre-proceeding and post-proceeding claims (other than certain pre-proceeding employment

<<<

 claims and post-proceeding procedural costs) (the ``New Money Lien''), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; and
 in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings

<<<

, accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not be rescheduled without their holders

<<<

' consent;
 in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of the c e s s a tio n d e s p a ie m e n ts and therefore the commencement date of the suspect period cannot be set by

<<<

 the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval of the agreement by the court.
A third party having granted a guarantee (s u re te p e rs o n n e lle ) or a security interest (s u re te re e lle ) can benefit from the grace periods

<<<

 granted to the debtor during conciliation proceedings as well as from the provisions of the approved or acknowledged agreement.
324

In the event of a breach of the agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the court for its termination

. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and Security Interests, except amounts already paid to them.
Conciliation

. If it fails to do so (or if it fails to file for conciliation alternatively), its directors and officers may be subject to civil liability. Creditors of the company do not attend the hearing before the court at which the opening of safeguard

The period from the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings (whether a safeguard or a judicial reorganization) to the date on which the court

<<<

 takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings is called the ``observation period'' and may last up to 18 months.
During the observation period, a court-appointed administrator, whose name can be suggested by the debtor in safeguard proceedings

<<<

, investigates the business of the company.
In safeguard proceedings, the administrator's mission is limited to either supervising or assisting the debtor's management and assisting it in preparing a safeguard plan for the company.
In judicial

<<<

 reorganization proceedings, the administrator's mission is usually to assist the management and to make proposals for the reorganization of the company, which may include a business continuation plan (equivalent to a safeguard plan) and/or

<<<

 the sale of all or part of the company's business to a third party. In judicial reorganization, the court may also decide that the administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the debtor's management.
Judicial liquidation proceedings

<<<

 entail the relief of the debtor of the management and there is no observation period in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote of the creditors, may be a sale of the business plan

<<<

 and/or isolated sales of the debtor's assets in order to discharge the debtor's liabilities. Where a sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a temporary continuation of the business for a maximum period

<<<

 of three months (renewable once for a period of three months at the Public Prosecutor's request) whose effects are similar to an observation period.
325

End of proceedings
At the end of the observation period, if the Court considers that

<<<

 the company can survive as a going concern, it will adopt a safeguard or reorganization plan which will entail a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts and may entail the divestiture of some or all of the debtor's assets and businesses

<<<

 (a sale of the entire business is not possible in a safeguard plan).
At any time during the observation period, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into reorganization proceedings (i) upon its own initiative, if the debtor appears to

<<<

 have been insolvent (en e ta td e c e s s a tio n d e s p a ie m e n ts ) before the opening of the proceedings, or (ii) at the debtors' request, or upon request of the administrator, the creditors' representative or the Public Prosecutor or

<<<

 upon its own initiative in the case where the debtor is cash-flow insolvent or (iii) at the debtors' request, or upon request of the administrator, the creditors' representative or the Public Prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the

<<<

 relevant creditors' committee and, if any, bondholders' assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings be closed. At

<<<

 any time during safeguard or reorganization proceedings, the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor is cash flow insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible.
Safeguard plan or reorganization

<<<

 plan
The manners in which the liabilities will be settled, as provided for in the plan (debt remissions and payment times) must be submitted to the creditors during a consultation, prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing

<<<

 consultation vary according to the size of the business.
"Ordinary" consultation: For debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or prepared by a chartered accountant, and who do not have more than 150 employees or 20 million

<<<

 of revenue, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors' representative, who, individually or collectively, obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a proof of claim, regarding

<<<

 the debt rescheduling or write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps proposed.
The French Commercial Code does not state whether the proposals for settlement can vary according to the creditor. According to legal commentaries and established practice

<<<

, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition, varying treatment of creditors should be possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors. In practice, it is also possible to make alternative proposals

<<<

 at the consultation stage (which generally breaks down into a short-term option, with debt remissions and rapid payment of the balance, and a long-term option, with 100% repayment of the debts over 10 years, the courts tend to impose a long

<<<

-term solution).
Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved or upon admission of their claims are not consulted.
In the event of a consultation in writing, if a

<<<

 creditor does not respond within 30 days from receipt of the letter from the creditors' representative, such creditor is deemed to have accepted the debt rescheduling and/or write-off. However, with respect to debt-to-equity swap proposals

<<<

, the creditors' representatives must obtain the agreement of each individual creditor in writing. The creditors' representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the administrator and the monitors

<<<

.
Within the framework of an ordinary consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to them, the court that approves the safeguard or reorganisation plan can only impose uniform debt deferrals over a maximum period

<<<

 of 10 years (it being noted that debts whose maturity dates exceed the duration of the plan are not concerned and their maturity dates shall remain the same). Any debt write-off or debt-to-equity swap is contingent on individual acceptance

<<<

.
The first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the total amount of the admitted debt claims).
C o m m itte e

<<<

 -b a s e d c o n s u lta tio n : For debtors who exceed the aforementioned thresholds, or for debtors who do not but with the authorization of the supervisory judge, the court-appointed administrator sets up two creditors' committees, on the

<<<

 basis of the debts that arose prior to the opening judgment: one for credit institutions (or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor) and their successive assignees having a claim against

<<<

 the debtor, and the other for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor's
326

suppliers. These committees will be consulted on the safeguard or reorganisation plan drafted by

<<<

 the debtor's management with the assistance of the judicial administrator during the observation period. In addition, any member of a committee may submit an alternative safeguard or reorganisation plan to the debtor and the court-appointed

<<<

 administrator it being specified that these alternative plans are subject (i) to the preparation of a report for each alternative plan from the administrator and (ii) to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and by a two-thirds

<<<

 majority vote of the general meeting of the holders of the Notes (although the holders of the Notes are not permitted to present their own alternative plan) for their approval.
The committees must vote on the safeguard or reorganisation plan

<<<

 within a minimum of 15 days of its submission. The plan must be approved by a vote of each committee, constituting a two-thirds majority of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote. The amounts of the claims secured by a trust

<<<

 (fid u c ie ) granted as security interest by the debtor are not taken into account. In addition, creditors for whom the plan does not provide any modification of their repayment schedule or provides for a payment of their claims in cash in

<<<

 full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted do not take part in the vote.
If there are any holders of the Notes, they are required to vote on the plan during a general meeting of all holders of the Notes held

<<<

 for that purpose and approve the plan at the same two-thirds majority vote. Approval of the plan at the two-thirds majority shall, if the plan is approved by the court, bind all the members of the committees and the holders of the Notes (including

<<<

 those who voted against the adoption of the plan). The plan submitted to the committees and the holders of the Notes, if any, must take into account subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings

<<<

, may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation and may notably include debt rescheduling or write-offs, and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

<<<


Each creditor member of a creditors committee and each note holder must, if applicable, inform the judicial administrator of the existence of any agreement which makes the exercise of its vote subject to any conditions or whose purpose is the

<<<

 full or total payment by a third party of its claim as well as of any subordination agreement. The judicial administrator shall then submit to the creditor/note holder a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee

<<<

/bondholders general meeting. In the event of a disagreement, the creditor/note holder or the judicial administrator may request that the matter be decided by the president of the applicable court in summary proceedings (en
re fe re ).
If, the

<<<

 creditors' committees and the meeting of the holders of the Notes approve the plan, and subject to verification by the court that the interests of all creditors are sufficiently safeguarded and to a rescheduling of the claims of creditors who

<<<

 are not members of the committees or general meeting of holders of the Notes (as discussed hereinafter), the court will approve the plan.
For those creditors outside the creditors' committee or the meeting of the holders of the Notes, they

<<<

 are consulted following the ``ordinary'' consultation process (see above).
In the event that the debtor company's proposed safeguard or reorganisation plan is not approved by both committees and the general meeting of holders of the Notes within

<<<

 the first six months of the observation period (it being noted that this 6 month period may be extended by the court at the request of the judicial administrator to the extent it does not exceed the duration of the observation period), either

<<<

 because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it, the court can still adopt a safeguard or reorganisation plan in the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case the rules are the same as those applicable

<<<

 to creditors who are not part of the committees and who are not holders of the Notes (see the ``ordinary'' consultation described above). The administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors

<<<

' representative, who, individually or collectively, obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a proof of claim, regarding the debt rescheduling or write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps proposed. If the creditors refuse the proposals that

<<<

 were submitted to them, the court that approves the safeguard on reorganization plan can only impose uniform debt deferrals over a maximum period of 10 years. Any debt write-off or debt-to-equity swap is contingent on individual acceptance

<<<

.
Creditors for whom the plan does not provide any amendment to their repayment terms or provides for a full repayment in cash of their claims as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted do not need to be consulted

<<<

 on the plan.
327

The creditors' representative in safeguard or reorganisation proceedings can summon a shareholder to pay any outstanding amount due over the shares he subscribed.
The opening judgment of safeguard or reorganisation proceedings

<<<

 leads to the immediate maturity of the amount not paid up of the share capital.
When the court mandates the administrator to convene the shareholder general meetings, in order to vote on the modifications of the articles of association provided

<<<

 by the plan, the administrator may decide that the general meeting will rule on first convening, by the majority of the votes held by the shareholders attending the meeting or represented at the meeting, provided that said shareholders hold

<<<

 at least half the shares with voting rights. On second convening, the common law provisions relating to the quorum and majority requirements shall apply .
In reorganization proceedings, in case the shareholders' equity has not been restored

<<<

, the administrator may appoint a trustee (m a n d a ta ire e n ju s tic e ) to vote in place of the shareholders refusing to vote to restore the shareholder's equity if the plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of any

<<<

 third party undertaking to comply with the recovery plan.
S p e c ific c a s e -- c r e d ito r s th a t a re p u b lic in s titu tio n s : Public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organizations

<<<

) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted by a private economic operator placed in the same position, under normal market conditions. Public creditors may also decide to enter into

<<<

 subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these Security Interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, within the framework of a commission before which the heads of finance departments of the organizations

<<<

 and institutions concerned are represented. The tax administrators may grant relief from all direct taxes. With regard to indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.
In the event that safeguard

<<<

 (or judicial reorganization) proceedings are opened against the French Guarantor, the holders of the Notes, if credit institutions or assimilated institutions, would vote on any draft plan proposed by the French Guarantor as members of the

<<<

 credit institutions committee.
A safeguard or reorganisation plan (the approval of which would require a two-thirds majority vote of each committee and the general meeting of the holders of the Notes) prepared by the French Guarantor' management

<<<

 and proposed by the French Guarantor to its creditors could include, among other things, debt rescheduling or the cancellation of debts, and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholders' consent). Holders

<<<

 of the Notes could, as members of the audit institutions committee, veto such plan if they reach a blocking minority (i.e., their claims represent more than one-third of the claims of those creditors casting a vote in the meeting). Conversely

<<<

, if a two-thirds majority is reached in each committee or meeting and the plan is subsequently approved by the relevant court, the plan will bind all the creditors of the French Guarantor (including holders of the Notes, and the members of

<<<

 the creditor's committees who voted against the adoption of the plan during the vote taken by the applicable general meeting of holders of the Notes or committee).
As a general matter, only the legal owner of the claim will be invited onto

<<<

 the credit institutions' committee. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the credit institutions' committee.
Accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings

<<<


A debtor in the course of c o n c ilia tio n proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed

<<<

 to ``fast-track'' the regular safeguard proceedings relating to large companies. The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is roughly the regime applicable to the regular safeguard proceeding

<<<

 to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard and or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, therefore some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims formed by owners

<<<

 are excluded by law.
The accelerated safeguard proceeding has effect against pre-insolvency creditors that have to file a proof of claim (see below) and as a consequence trade creditors notably will be involved in the accelerated safeguard

<<<

 proceedings, whereas accelerated financial safeguard proceedings only involve financial creditors (i.e. members of the credit institutions committee and the bondholders' general
328

assembly), with no impact on suppliers or public creditors

<<<

 notably (who will thus continue to be paid according to their applicable contract terms and are not subject to the automatic stay applicable during the observation period).
The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings

<<<

 is similar to the one applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings (which is now designed as the common accelerated proceeding, the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings being a variety of the latter, designed to ``fast-track'' purely

<<<

 financial difficulties).
To be eligible to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill the following conditions:
 the debtor must be subject to ongoing c o n c ilia tio n proceedings when it

<<<

 applies for the opening of the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings;
 the debtor must not be insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of c o n c ilia tio n ;
 as is the case for

<<<

 regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome;
 in the context of c o n c ilia tio n proceedings, the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan that aims to protect its operations

<<<

 in the long run and which is likely to be supported, within the group of those creditors who will be affected by the accelerated safeguard proceedings, by a sufficiently large majority of them to allow a likely adoption of the plan by the relevant

<<<

 creditors' committees and bondholders general assembly if any within the duration of the procedure i.e. three months for accelerated safeguard proceedings or a maximum of two months for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings;
 the debtor

<<<

 must (i) have its accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by an accounting expert and have (x) more than twenty employees; or (y) have a turnover greater than 3 million excluding any applicable taxes; or (z) have total assets

<<<

 in its balance sheet greater than 1.5 million or (ii) establish consolidated financial statements in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; and
 the debtor must exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors

<<<

' committee (see above) or the court shall have ordered such constitution in the opening decision.
Where accelerated safeguard proceedings are opened, the creditors committees (only the credit institutions committee in accelerated financial

<<<

 safeguard proceedings) and the bondholders' general assembly are convened and are required to vote on the proposed accelerated safeguard plan within the minimum period of 15 days of delivery of the proposed plan (applicable in safeguard proceedings

<<<

) (eight days in accelerated financial safeguard proceedings).
The plan is adopted following the same majority rules as in regular safeguard proceedings and it may notably provide for a debt rescheduling, and/or debt cancellation, and/or conversion

<<<

 of debt into equity (requiring the relevant shareholder consent).
The total duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months, while the duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is one month, unless the court

<<<

 decides to extend it by one additional month. If no plan is adopted by the creditors committee(s) and the bondholders' general assembly at the relevant majority rules within such timeframe, the Court shall terminate the accelerated safeguard

<<<

 or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings and may not impose any uniform debt rescheduling.
Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings
Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (re d re s s e m e n t or liq u id a tio

<<<

 n ju d ic ia ir e ) may be initiated against or by a company only if it is insolvent (see ``-- In s o lv e n c y Test") and, for the liquidation proceedings only, if the company's recovery is manifestly impossible. The company is required to

<<<

 petition for insolvency proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings) within 45 days of becoming insolvent. If it does not, de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers may incur civil liability. Such proceedings

<<<

 may also be initiated by any creditor or the public prosecutor.
329

The date of insolvency (c e s s a tio n d e s p a ie m e n ts ) is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date

<<<

, which may be up to 18 months before the date of the court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (h o m o lo g a tio n ) in the

<<<

 context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the suspect period. Certain transactions undertaken during the suspect period may be void or voidable.
Under the judicial reorganization

<<<

 the administrator appointed by the court will assist the debtor in making some or all the management decisions (m is s io n d 'a s s is ta n c e ) and may also be empowered by the court to take over the management and control the company (m

<<<

 is s io n d 'a d m in is tra tio n ). The opening of liquidation proceedings entails the relief of the debtor of the management.
The court order commencing the proceedings may order either the reorganization or the liquidation of the company

<<<

. In the event of reorganization, an administrator is usually appointed by the court (a d m in is tra te u r ju d ic ia ir e ) to investigate the business of the company during an initial observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and

<<<

 makes proposals either for the reorganization of the company (by helping the debtor to elaborate a reorganization plan--see above), or the sale of the business (plan de cession) or the liquidation of the company. Committees of creditors and

<<<

 meetings of the holders of the Notes may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings. At any time during this observation period, the court can order the liquidation of the company. At the end of the observation period

<<<

, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.
Concerning the liquidation proceedings, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation scenario:
 a sale of the business (p la n d e c e s s io n ), or
 a sale of the assets one

<<<

 by one (via auction sales or sales on an amicable basis).
The Court may terminate the proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty to sell the assets. The Court

<<<

 may also appoint a m a n d a ta ire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocate the amounts received from these lawsuits.
Void and voidable transactions
``Void transactions'' include transactions or payments entered into during the

<<<

 suspect period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the

<<<

 company significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, any escrow ordered by a judicial decision if such

<<<

 decision is not final when reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, security granted for debts previously incurred, any provisional measures (unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations

<<<

 relating to stock options, fiduciary transfers (unless the transfer is made as security for indebtedness entered into simultaneously) and modifications to existing fiduciary transfers securing previous debts, declarations of non-seizability

<<<

 (d e c la ra tio n d 'in s a is is s a b ilite ).
``Voidable transactions'' include payments for due debts made from the date of insolvency, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis a tie rs d e

<<<

 te n te u r), seizures (s a is ie a ttrib u tio n ) and oppositions made during the suspect period if the party dealing with the debtor company knew that it was insolvent (see ``--In s o lv e n c y Test" ). Transactions relating to the transfer

<<<

 of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the suspect period.
Creditors' liability
Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case

<<<

 law, where safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting of such facilities

<<<

 was wrongful and, in the case of fraud, interference with the management of the debtor or if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to

<<<

 support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable in such circumstances can be cancelled or reduced by the court.
330

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company's management, it can be deemed to be a de facto manager

<<<

 of such company (d irig e a n t d e fa it). In such a case, Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if judicial liquidation proceedings (liq u id a tio n ju d ic ia ir e ) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor

<<<

 may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company's assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement contributed to the company's shortfall

<<<

 of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.
Status of creditors during safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization

<<<

 proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings
As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a proof of claim with the court-appointed creditors' representative 

<<<

(m a n d a ta ire ju d ic ia ir e ) within two months of the publication of the court order in the B u lle tin O ffic ie l d e s A n n o n c e s C iv ile s e t C o m m e rc ia le s (in an exception, the deadline begins upon the receipt of an

<<<

 individual notification for those creditors whose claims arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Where the debtor has

<<<

 informed the creditors' representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors' representative. Creditors are allowed to confirm a proof of claim made on their behalf

<<<

. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors' representative, save for a ratification by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its behalf, are barred, except

<<<

 with respect to very limited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limits and are preferential creditors under French law.
In accelerated safeguard and accelerated

<<<

 financial safeguard proceedings, the debts held by creditors affected by the opening of the relevant proceedings that took part in the conciliation negotiation are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence

<<<

, its accountant) are thus deemed to have been filed. Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims

<<<

 as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four months' time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (even though they would be party to the creditors' committee or the bondholders

<<<

' general assembly) would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned legal time limit.
From the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings (safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard

<<<

, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings), the company is prohibited from paying (i) debts outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially concern the set-off of interrelated debts and payments

<<<

 made to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business, provided that such payments are authorized by the bankruptcy judge and (ii) debts arising after the opening of the proceedings if such debts

<<<

 are not useful to the proceedings (post-opening, non-privileged debts). During this period, creditors may not pursue any legal action against the company with respect to any claim arising prior to the court order commencing the proceedings

<<<

 or, as the case may be, for the aforementioned post-opening, non-privileged debts if the objective of such legal action is:
 to obtain an order for or a payment of a sum of money by the company to the creditor (however, the creditor may require

<<<

 that the court fix the amount due); or
 to terminate a contract for the non payment of pre-petition amounts owed by the company; or
 to enforce the creditor's rights against any assets of the company, except where such asset, whether tangible

<<<

 or intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another Member State, in which case the rights in re m of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency procedure, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 of EU Insolvency Regulation

<<<

 1346/2000.
Debts arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business's activities during the observation period or are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for

<<<

 a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions

<<<

, such as the New Money Lien).
331

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the above rules only apply to the creditors that are subject to the accelerated safeguard proceedings and the accelerated

<<<

 financial safeguard proceedings respectively (see above).
The debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors (or in its absence, its accountant

<<<

). Although such creditors can file proofs of claims pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor

<<<

 (within the two or four months' time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceeding (but who would be impacted by the proceedings) would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned legal time limits

<<<

.
Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company's obligations upon the occurrence of the opening of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings

<<<

 are not enforceable under French law. The opening of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a company's obligations unless the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a

<<<

 plan for the sale of the business (p la n d e c e s s io n ) is ordered by the court (three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the plan for the

<<<

 sale of the business or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening of the proceedings constitutes an event of default are not enforceable against the debtor, as well

<<<

 as, according to a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n12-22.909, ``contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the

<<<

 debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings'' (which should also apply in case of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings).
The court-appointed administrator may elect to terminate ongoing

<<<

 contracts (c o n tra ts e n c o u rs ) which he or she believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. On the contrary, he or she may require the continuation of such contracts provided that the company fully performs its post

<<<

-petition contractual obligations, or may decide not to continue them. During reorganization proceedings, when the ongoing contract involves the payment of a sum of money, this payment must be made in cash, unless the administrator obtains extended

<<<

 payment deadlines from the contractual partner of the debtor has been deleted; the administrator is under an obligation to verify that by continuing the contract he or she does not risk creating a foreseeable damage for the contractual partner

<<<

.
The court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems necessary to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.
If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business in judicial

<<<

 reorganization or liquidation proceedings with a temporary continuation of the business, the proceeds from the sale will be allocated for the payment of creditors according to their ranking.
If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation

<<<

 of the company, the court will appoint a liquidator to sell the assets of the company and settle the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, if a plan for the sale of the business is under consideration, the court

<<<

 will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the company and organize such sale of the business.
French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including employees, officials appointed by

<<<

 the insolvency court as required by the regulations relating to insolvency proceedings, creditors who, as part of the approved conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, certain secured creditors in the event of judicial

<<<

 liquidation proceedings, post-petition creditors, the French State, other pre-petition secured creditors and pre-petition unsecured creditors.
Limitations on the Guarantees
The liabilities and obligations of the French Guarantor are subject

<<<

 to:
 certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or misuse of the corporate assets

<<<

 within the meaning of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and
332

 French corporate benefit rules, in particular and without limitation, should a guarantee be granted by the French Guarantor that is a subsidiary

<<<

 of the Issuer, a guarantee limitation amount would apply corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the Offering applied by the Issuer for the direct or indirect benefit of the French Guarantor through any intercompany loans to the

<<<

 French Guarantor or its subsidiaries and outstanding on the date a payment is made under the Guarantee.
Accordingly, any guarantee by the French Guarantor will be given in consideration of, and limited to, the amounts of the proceeds of the

<<<

 Notes (if any) that will be made available by the Issuer to the French Guarantor and/or the subsidiaries of that French Guarantor (if any), via intercompany loan arrangements or otherwise, in each case to the extent such loans are outstanding

<<<

 to the French Guarantor and/or its subsidiaries at the time when a payment is required under the Guarantee. By virtue of this limitation, the French Guarantor's obligation under the Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable

<<<

 with respect to the Notes, or the French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.
In addition, if the French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the Guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic

<<<

 benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm's-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm'slength transaction could be taxable or non tax deductible under

<<<

 certain circumstances.
Under French financial assistance rules, a court could void any guarantee or security document that constitutes prohibited financial assistance. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could subordinate or void

<<<

 any guarantee or security document and, if payment or enforcement had already been made under the relevant guarantee or security document, require that the recipient return the payment or security documents or the security interest thereunder

<<<

 to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the guarantor did not derive an overall corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security interest as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual

<<<

 matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Based on current case law certain inter-group transactions (including up-stream guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the relevant company, in particular, where the following

<<<

 four criteria are fulfilled:
 existence of a genuine group of companies to which the guarantor and the person whose obligations are being guaranteed belong operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective and the guarantee or

<<<

 security documents, and the transaction to which they relate, must be entered into in furtherance of the common economic interest of the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate with such group benefit;

<<<


 the risk assumed by the guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;
 the guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee or security

<<<

 interest which is commensurate with the liability which it takes on under the guarantee or security interest; and
 the obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee or security interest must not exceed its financial capability.
The existence

<<<

 of a real and adequate benefit to the French Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.
Limitation on enforcement of Security

<<<

 Interests
Security Interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be enforced following a payment default (including following acceleration) and may only secure obligations up to the secured amount that is

<<<

 due and remaining unpaid. Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds

<<<

 of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure (a ttrib u tio n ju d ic ia ire ) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (a ttrib u tio n c o n v e n tio n n e lle or p a c

<<<

 te c o m m is s o ire ) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets.
If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial

<<<

 foreclosure or private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed
333

assets. In proceedings regarding an a ttrib u tio n ju d ic ia ir e or a p a c te c o m m is s o ire , an expert

<<<

 is appointed to value the collateral (in this case, the securities). If the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor an amount (the s o u lte ) equal to the difference

<<<

 between the value of the securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.
If the value of such securities

<<<

 is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.
Should the

<<<

 holders of the security over such collateral decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law

<<<

. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such public auction might not reflect the value of our business as a going concern

<<<

.
Parallel debt
Under French law, certain ``accessory'' Security Interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such Security Interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do

<<<

 not hold the secured claim, unless they act as Trustees (fid u c ia ire s ) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agents (a g e n ts d e s s u re te s ) under Article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code, which is not the case

<<<

 here for the security documents governed by French law. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured

<<<

 claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a ``Parallel Debt.'' Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Indenture and the

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreement (see ` `R is k F a c to rs -- R is k s R e la te d to th e C o lla te ra l-- T h e S e c u rity In te re s ts in th e C o lla te r a l w ill n o t b e g r a n te d d ir e c t ly to th e h o ld e r s o f th e N o t e

<<<

 s " ). The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, will not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and may not secure the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. There is one published decision

<<<

 of the French Supreme Court (C o u r d e c a s s a tio n ) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (C a ss. c o m . September 13, 2011 n10-25533 Belvedere) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability

<<<

 in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel

<<<

 Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (o rd re p u b lic in te rn a tio n a l) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability

<<<

 as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that

<<<

 such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French Security Interests

<<<

 securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of

<<<

 a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate or mitigate

<<<

 the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds

<<<

 from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral securing the Parallel Debt.
Trustee
Pledges governed by French law may also be granted to the benefit of the Security Agent as Trustee for the holders of the Notes in accordance

<<<

 with the provisions of the Indenture, and may therefore not directly be granted to holders of the Notes. A concept of ``trust'' has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 b is of the FTC and the French Supreme Court (C o u r d e

<<<

 c a s s a tio n ) has held, in the Belvedere decision referred to above in respect of the Parallel Debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a
33

<<<

4

creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the La Haye Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition

<<<

, so that the concept of ``trust'' has not been generally recognized under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral created under the trust construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the

<<<

 Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral securing the trustee rights.
Fraudulent conveyance
French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside

<<<

 insolvency proceedings, the ` `a c tio n p a u lie n n e '' provisions, which offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant

<<<

 to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such person's or a third party's obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing

<<<

 security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors' representative (m a n d a ta ire ju d ic ia ir e ) , the commissioner of the safeguard or

<<<

 recovery plan (c o m m is s a ire a I 'e x e c u tio n d u p la n ), insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means

<<<

 of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in

<<<

 the case of the person's insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or

<<<

 should have known that one or more of such person's creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (a titre g ra tu it), in which case such knowledge of the

<<<

 counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the granting of a guarantee by the French Guarantor involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defence under

<<<

 applicable law, then the granting of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges

<<<

, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Guarantee and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly

<<<

, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the French Guarantor as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.
Germany
Insolvency

<<<


In the event of insolvency of a guarantor or a provider of collateral organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its centre of main interests in Germany (the ``German Providers'') any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be

<<<

 initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law.
The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (In s o lv e n z o rd n u n g ), may not be as favorable to creditors

<<<

 as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as Security Interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence

<<<

 may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.
The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.
Under

<<<

 German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court e x o ffic io , but require that the debtor (In s o lv e n z s c h u ld n e r) and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency

<<<

 proceedings (A n tra g a u f E r o ffn u n g d e s In s o lv e n z v e rfa h re n s ). Insolvency proceedings under German law with respect to a debtor incorporated or established as a German limited liability company (G e s e lls c h a ft

<<<

 m it b e s c h ro n k te r H a ftu n g ), a German stock corporation (A k tie n g e s e lls c h a ft) a European law stock corporation (S o c ie ta s E u ro p a e a , or SE) or any other corporation or partnership not having an individual as

<<<

 a personally liable shareholder, can be initiated by
335

either the debtor or the creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (U b e rs c h u ld u n g ) or illiquidity (Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it) of the debtor. A debtor is illiquid

<<<

 if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. A debtor is considered over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless a continuation of the business is predominantly likely. Whether the debtor's liabilities

<<<

 exceed the value of its assets must be assessed on the basis of an over-indebtedness balance sheet to be drawn up on the basis of the liquidation values. The continuation of the business is predominantly likely if -- as a decision to be taken

<<<

 by the company's management at its own discretion -- it is more likely than not (>50%) that within, as a rule of thumb, the current and the subsequent financial year, the company will be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due. If a

<<<

 German limited liability company, a German stock corporation (A k tie n g e s e lls c h a ft), a European law stock corporation (S o c ie ta s E u ro p a e a , or S E ), any other limited liability company or any company not having an individual

<<<

 as personally liable shareholder gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company is obliged to file for insolvency without undue delay (o h n e s c h u ld h a fte s Z o g e rn ), however, at the

<<<

 latest within 21 days after illiquidity or over-indebtedness have occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, the debtor is entitled, but not

<<<

 obliged, to file for insolvency proceedings if it unlikely to be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due in the future ( d ro h e n d e Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it).
If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted

<<<

 but not yet illiquid it may also file for preliminary ``debtor-in-possession'' moratorium proceedings (``S c h u tz s c h irm v e rfa h re n " ) unless -- from a third party perspective -- there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring

<<<

. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (v o rla u fig e r S a c h w a lte r) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). The court may also resolve other preliminary

<<<

 measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in ``debtor-in-possession'' proceedings (E ig e n v e

<<<

 rw a ltu n g ) after main insolvency proceedings have been opened.
The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition

<<<

 (whether it aims for debtor-in-possession moratorium proceedings as outlined above or at ordinary insolvency proceedings), the insolvency court may and usually take preliminary measures to secure the insolvency estate (In s o lv e n z m a s

<<<

 s e ) during the preliminary proceedings (In s o lv e n z e ro ffn u n g s v e rfa h re n ). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor's assets other than immovable assets

<<<

 during these preliminary proceedings and will, in almost all cases, appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (v o rla u fig e r In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r), unless the debtor has applied for so-called ``debtor-in-possession'' proceedings

<<<

 (E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ) in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary trustee (v o rla u fig e r S a c h w a lte r) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. The duty of the preliminary administrator is

<<<

, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the insolvency estate (In s o lv e n z m a s s e ), to verify the existence of a reason for the opening of insolvency proceedings (In s o lv e n z e ro ffn u n g s g ru n d ) and to assess whether

<<<

 the debtor's net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings.
During preliminary insolvency proceedings a ``preliminary creditors' committee'' (v o rla u fig e r G la u b ig e ra u s s c h u s s ) can be appointed

<<<

 by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements (in the financial year prior to the insolvency filing): a balance sheet total in excess of 4,840,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted

<<<

), revenues of at least 9,680,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing and/or fifty or more employees in the yearly average. The requirements apply to the respective entity without taking into account

<<<

 the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors' committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following

<<<

: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator ( v o rla u fig e r In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r) or an insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r), orders for ``debtor-in-possession'' proceedings (A n o rd n u n g

<<<

 d e r E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ), and the appointment of a preliminary trustee ( v o rla u fig e r S a c h w a lte r).
The court orders the opening (E ro a ffn u n g s b e s c h lu s s ) of formal insolvency proceedings (eroaffnetes In s o

<<<

 lv e n z v e rfa h re n ) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there is a reason for the opening of insolvency proceedings (i.e. over-indebtedness and/or (pending) illiquidity) and if there are sufficient assets to cover at least

<<<

 the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third
336

parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves

<<<

. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (A b w e is u n g m a n g e ls M a s s e ) following which the company will be deemed dissolved and put into

<<<

 liquidation.
Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, the right to administer and dispose over the business and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r) who is appointed by the insolvency

<<<

 court unless the so-called ``debtor-in-possession'' (E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ) is ordered, in which event the court will only appoint a trustee (S a c h w a lte r) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. The creditors

<<<

 are only entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors' assembly (e rs te G la u b ig e rv e rs a m m lu n g ) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast

<<<

 (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e. sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and

<<<

 impartial.
The insolvency administrator has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor's assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession

<<<

, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor's operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the insolvency estate (M a s s e s c h u ld e n ) will be preferred

<<<

 to any liabilities created by the debtor (or a preliminary insolvency administrator/trustee prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (including secured debt, subject to rights of separate satisfaction (A b s o n d e ru n g s re

<<<

 c h te ) and other Security Interests). The insolvency administrator or trustee may, on the grounds of avoidance (In s o lv e n z a n fe c h tu n g ), also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which

<<<

 were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (A u s s o n d e ru n g s re c h t) as opposed to a

<<<

 preferential right (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h t)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer

<<<

 pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (In s o lv e n z o rd n u n g ). Any individual enforcement action (Z w a n g s v o lls tre c

<<<

 k u n g ) already brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once formal insolvency proceedings have been opened (and may be subject to such stay already prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings

<<<

). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, certain secured creditors have preferential rights (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h te

<<<

 ) regarding the enforcement of their security interest. Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. The insolvency

<<<

 administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h te ) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (M o b ilia rp fa

<<<

 n d re c h te ) or transfers of title by way of security (S ic h e ru n g s u a b e re ig n u n g )) as well (ii) to collect any claims that have been assigned by way of security (S ic h e ru n g s a b tre tu n g e n ). In case that the enforcement

<<<

 right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (F e s ts te llu n g s k o s te n ) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (V e rw

<<<

 e rtu n g s k o s te n ) which, in aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds, and less German value added tax (U m s a tz s te u e r) at a rate of currently 19% thereon (if applicable), are paid to the creditor holding

<<<

 a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.
The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (M a sse g la a u b ig e r) first (including the costs

<<<

 of the insolvency proceedings). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Most other claims (In s o lv e n

<<<

 z fo rd e ru n g e n ), in particular claims of unsecured creditors unless they are subordinated as a matter of statutory law, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate of the

<<<

 debtor (In s o lv e n z m a s s e ) after all Security Interests and prior-ranking liabilities have been settled and paid. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (In s o lv e n z p la n ) that

<<<

 can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among others and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules

<<<

. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a
337

debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor of debt into a debt-to-equity swap if it does not consent to such debt-to

<<<

-equity swap.
The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h t) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator

<<<

, however, may then be required to compensate the creditor for the loss in value of such movable asset.
If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted (but not yet illiquid) it may also file for insolvency in the form of a protection

<<<

 scheme (S c h u tz s c h irm v e rfa h re n ). In such a case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect

<<<

 the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for a period of up to three months. During such period, the debtor shall, together with its creditors and a preliminary trustee (v o rlo u fig e r S a c h w a lte r), prepare an insolvency plan which

<<<

 ideally will be implemented in formal self-administration proceedings (E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.
Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is

<<<

 no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from an insolvency laws point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there

<<<

 is, in particular, no pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-a-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. In 2013, the German Federal Ministry of Justice (B u n d e s ju s tiz m in

<<<

 is te riu m ) has released a draft Bill to Facilitate the Handling of Group Insolvencies (E n tw u rf e in e s G e s e tz e s z u r E r le ic h te r u n g d e r B e w o ltig u n g v o n K o n z e rn in s o lv e n z e n ). While the draft Bill

<<<

 does not propose to abolish the principle of separate insolvency proceedings in relation to each group entity, it stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Act in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies

<<<

: (1) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (2) the appointment of an identical person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (3) certain coordination obligations are imposed

<<<

 on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors' committees; and (4) certain parties may apply for ``coordination proceedings'' (K o o rd in a tio n s v e rfa h re n ) and the appointment of a ``coordination insolvency administrator

<<<

'' (K o o rd in a tio n s v e rw a lte r) with the ability to propose a ``coordination plan'' (K o o rd in a tio n s p la n ). It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified form, this Bill might be adopted by parliament

<<<

.
Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return

<<<

 of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors.
Powers of

<<<

 attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator

<<<

 opts for performance.
Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ``escape clauses'' entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening

<<<

 of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (in s o lv e n z b e z o g e n e K o n d ig u n g s re c h te o d e r L o s u n

<<<

 g s k la u s e ln ) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements

<<<

 that are not governed by German law.
Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a ``shareholder-like position'' (g e s e lls c h a fte

<<<

 ro h n lic h e S te llu n g ) in the relevant debtor company. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such debtor, the claims against such debtor would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (n a c h ra n g ig e

<<<

 In s o lv e n z fo rd e ru n g e n ), meaning that dividends on such claim would only be made if all non-subordinated creditors' claims have been fully satisfied. Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency

<<<

 proceedings over the assets of the debtor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed

<<<

 by German law as in most
338

cases, the insolvency estate will not be sufficient to make any dividends on subordinated insolvency claims.
Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer
In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German

<<<

 Provider, which would most likely be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the guarantee or security interest provided by that entity could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n

<<<

 z v e rw a lte r) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung).
Under these rules, an insolvency administrator (or in the event of debtor-in possession proceedings, the trustee (S a c h w a lte r

<<<

)), may challenge acts (R e c h ts h a n d lu n g e n ) and transactions ( R e c h ts g e s c h a fte ) that are deemed detrimental to the insolvency estate and have been effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. Such challengeable

<<<

 transactions can include payments under any guarantee or security or the granting of any guarantee or security interest. In the event that a transaction is successfully challenged, the beneficiaries of such guarantee (such as the holders of

<<<

 Notes) or such security interest would be under an obligation to repay the amount already received under the relevant security or guarantee, or to waive the guarantee or security interest. In particular, a transaction detrimental to the insolvency

<<<

 estate may be challenged according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases:
 any act (R e c h ts h a n d lu n g ) or transaction (R e c h ts g e s c h a ft) granting a creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security

<<<

 (S ic h e ru n g ) or satisfaction for a debt (B e frie d ig u n g ) can be avoided if such act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction

<<<

 the debtor was illiquid (z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig ), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and

<<<

 the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity or of the filing of such petition (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggesting such cash flow insolvency);
 any act (R e c h ts h a n d lu n g ) or transaction (R e c h ts g e

<<<

 s c h a ft) granting a creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not

<<<

 entitled to such security or satisfaction can be avoided if such act was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; if such act was effected in the second and third month prior to the

<<<

 filing, it can be avoided if at the time of such act (i) the debtor was cash illiquid, or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggesting

<<<

 such detrimental effects);
 any transaction (R e c h ts g e s c h a ft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor, or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which

<<<

 a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable if it was entered into, can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings

<<<

 against the debtor, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor

<<<

 and the other party to the transaction had knowledge of either the debtor's illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;
 any act by the debtor without adequate consideration (e.g. whereby a debtor grants security for a third

<<<

 party debt) might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (u n e n tg e ltlic h ); a gratuitous transaction can be avoided if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings

<<<

 against the debtor;
 any act performed by the debtor, including the granting of guarantees and security interest, during a period of 10 years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing

<<<

, if the debtor acted with the intention to prejudice its creditors can be avoided if the other party had knowledge of such intention at the time of such act;
 any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of

<<<

 the debtor which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded within two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other
339

party had no knowledge

<<<

 of the debtor's intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term ``related party'' includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25%

<<<

 of the debtor's share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any

<<<

 of the foregoing persons;
 any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (G e s e lls c h a fte rd a rle h e n ) or an economically equivalent claim can be avoided;
 (i) in

<<<

 the event it provided security, if the act was effected in the last 10 years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it resulted in satisfaction, if the act was effected in

<<<

 the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or
 a transaction whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be avoided

<<<

 if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (B u rg e ) (in which

<<<

 case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).
In this context, ``knowledge'' is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be

<<<

 drawn that the debtor (e.g., an entity subject to the German insolvency laws) was subject to illiquidity, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice

<<<

, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor's imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor

<<<

's creditors. With respect to a ``related party'', there is a general statutory presumption that such party had knowledge.
If a guarantee or collateral by any German Provider was avoided or held unenforceable for any reason, a holder of the

<<<

 Notes would cease to have any claim or benefit in respect thereof. Any amounts received from a transaction that had been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvent estate.
Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding,

<<<

 a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (V o lls tre c k u n g s tite l) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain

<<<

 transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Act on Avoidance (A n fe c h tu n g s g e s e tz ). The prerequisites differ to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance

<<<

 periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.
In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor

<<<

 may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor's (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor's (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The

<<<

 German Federal Supreme Court (B u n d e s g e ric h ts h o f) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation

<<<

 of the legal principle of bonos mores (S itte n w id rig k e it). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was

<<<

 close to collapse (Z u s a m m e n b ru c h ), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.
Parallel debt
Under German law, any ``accessory'' Security Interests such as pledges (P fa n d re c h te ) require that the pledgee and the

<<<

 creditor be the same person. Such Security Interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes, will not be party to the security documents relating to the Collateral. In order for

<<<

 the holders of the Notes to benefit from Collateral under ``accessory'' security documents, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a ``parallel debt''. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder

<<<

 of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes and the Guarantees. The pledges governed by German law will directly secure the parallel debt. The parallel debt procedure has not been tested in court under German law,

<<<

 and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Further, if the parallel debt is novated from the Security Agent to a new security agent or
340

another third party, any German

<<<

 law governed accessory Security Interests such as pledges (P fa n d re c h te ) would extinguish and would therefore need to be re-created with the consequence that hardening periods would start again from the date of recreation of security

<<<

.
Limitations on enforcement
If a German guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the form of a German limited liability company (G e s e lls c h a ft m it b e s c h ra n k te r H a ftu n g or ``GmbH''), the granting of collateral (including

<<<

 a guarantee of the notes) by a German guarantor is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (the ``GmbHG''), including rules on capital maintenance.
As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (``Sections

<<<

 30 and 31'') prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH's net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase

<<<

 an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital ( B e g ru n d u n g o d e r V e rtie fu n g e in e r U n te rb ila n z ). Guarantees granted by a GmbH in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister

<<<

 company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and

<<<

 to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called ``limitation language'' in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of

<<<

 a GmbH or limited liability partnership with a GmbH as its sole general partner (a GmbH & Co. KG) incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to enforce the guarantees

<<<

 against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH's (or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner's) net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share

<<<

 capital (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and any guarantee provided by any German guarantor will contain such limitation language

<<<

 in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG cannot be enforced at all.
German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future court rulings

<<<

 may further limit the access of a shareholder to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH or of a GmbH & Co. KG, the general partner or general partners of which is or are a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability

<<<

 of any German guarantor to make payments under the guarantee.
Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (B u n d e s g e r ic h ts h o f) regarding so-called destructive interference (e x is te

<<<

 n z v e rn ic h te n d e r E in g riff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement

<<<

 of a subsidiary guarantee granted by any German guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court ( B u n d e s

<<<

 g e ric h ts h o f), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral

<<<

 by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of a subsidiary guarantee by any German guarantor.
Furthermore, under German

<<<

 law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations secured by such security.
New Zealand
Norske

<<<

 Skog Tasman Limited is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of New Zealand (the ``New Zealand Guarantor''). All share capital in the New Zealand Guarantor is owned by Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited. The New Zealand

<<<

 Guarantor will guarantee the Notes and will grant a general security interest over all its present and after acquired property (subject to agreed exceptions including in respect of trade receivables subject to factoring arrangements) as security

<<<

 for its obligations under the guarantee.
341

The following is only a summary of the processes and relevant issues relating to security interests, enforcement and insolvency proceedings under New Zealand law (the rules relating to which are

<<<

 detailed and can be complex).
Enforcement of Guarantee with respect to the Exchange Notes
The Guarantee is a contractual obligation that is unsecured and subordinated in accordance with its terms. The Guarantee will rank pari passu with all

<<<

 other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the New Zealand Guarantor in a liquidation of the New Zealand Guarantor. The Guarantee is enforceable by bringing proceedings in the courts of New Zealand against the New Zealand Guarantor

<<<

.
Enforcement of Guarantee with respect to the Senior Secured Notes
The guarantee will be governed by the laws of the State of New York and the security agreement will be governed by the laws of New Zealand. Such general security agreement will

<<<

 include an agreement by the New Zealand Guarantor to grant a first ranking mortgage over the land comprising the mill site of the New Zealand Guarantor but such mortgage will not be required to be registered immediately on the New Zealand land

<<<

 register maintained by Land Information New Zealand (``LINZ'').
Priority of interests registered on the LINZ register against New Zealand land is generally determined by order in time of registration. LINZ registration of the mortgage over

<<<

 the mill site (in order to achieve perfection and best priority of such mortgage) cannot take place until a caveat against dealings (which is LINZ registered against the certificate of title to the mill site) recording the grant of a lease

<<<

 to Mighty River Power Limited is discharged (this is expected to occur when the lease is LINZ registered and all associated issues are resolved). Accordingly only an equitable agreement to mortgage the mill site rather than a duly perfected

<<<

 LINZ registered mortgage will be possible at the outset (without the discharge occurring as noted above), but the general security agreement shall include a covenant by the New Zealand Guarantor to register the mortgage of the mill site with

<<<

 LINZ as soon as the caveat is removed.
In addition all shares of the New Zealand Guarantor owned by Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited will be made subject to a New Zealand law governed specific security agreement granted by Norske Skog

<<<

 Industries Australia Limited in favour of the Security Agent in support of the obligations of Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited as guarantor of the Notes (such guarantee to be governed by the laws of the State of New York).
Enforcement

<<<

 of Security Interests
M o rtg a g e o f la n d -s ta tu to ry n o tic e re q u ire d b e fo re p o w e r o f sa le ca n b e e x e rc is e d
In order for a secured party to exercise a right to sell mortgaged land pursuant to a registered mortgage

<<<

, the secured party must first serve statutory notice (in accordance with the New Zealand Property Law Act 2007) on the mortgagor, subsequent mortgagees and guarantors of its intention to exercise its power to sell the mortgaged property. The

<<<

 minimum notice period is 20 working days. Pending expiry of such notice, the mortgagee may market the property and may enter into an agreement to sell the property, provided that it is conditional on the statutory notice having expired un-remedied

<<<

.
Enforcement by exercise of a right to sell mortgaged land pursuant to the terms of an unregistered agreement to mortgage land (as initially contemplated pursuant to the general security agreement described above) is uncertain and will be subject

<<<

 to serious practical difficulties. Accordingly additional steps or legal remedies (if available) may be required to be exercised in order to perfect or elevate an unregistered agreement to mortgage land to a registered mortgage before such

<<<

 mortgage is enforceable in practice.
P e rso n a l P ro p e rty S e curities A c t 1999
The New Zealand Personal Property Securities Act 1999 (``PPSA'') establishes a code for determining the validity and priority of the claims of secured creditors

<<<

 and other parties with interests in personal property. The PPSA is based on similar regimes operating in North America and a similar regime came into full force in Australia in early 2012.
Under the PPSA as a general rule, priority between

<<<

 secured parties with a perfected security interest in the same collateral is determined by the order in which the secured parties took possession or
342

registered financing statements against the collateral on the New Zealand Personal Property

<<<

 Securities Register. However, the priority rules under the PPSA are complex and there are a number of specific priority rules that modify the general rule in certain circumstances (including without limitation in respect of perfected ``purchase

<<<

 money security interests'' which if properly perfected may enjoy `super priority'' in respect of the collateral subject to such interest). In addition, any security interest (mortgage) in respect of real property requires separate (first in

<<<

 time) registration on the land register maintained by LINZ in order to ensure best priority.
The PPSA also regulates the enforcement of Security Interests in collateral by secured parties. The secured party and the debtor can agree to contract

<<<

 out of certain of the debtor's statutory rights that would otherwise apply on enforcement and this shall be reflected in the New Zealand law security agreements entered into by the New Zealand Guarantor and its shareholder.
O th e r duties

<<<

, o b lig a tio n s a n d lim ita tio n s
The enforceability and priority of a New Zealand law guarantee and security interest (and the application of the proceeds thereof) is also subject to general law and statutory duties, obligations and

<<<

 limitations, including without limitation the following where applicable:
(i) there are certain categories of claims which could have preferred status over the claims of Senior Secured Note holders under New Zealand law such as claims for wages

<<<

, salaries or compensation and claims for certain taxes;
(ii) the right of a party granting security to redeem the property subject to security by tender of payment in full of the money secured at any time prior to the sale of that property

<<<

;
(iii) the provisions of the Property Law Act 2007 and the Land Transfer Act 1952, in respect of the enforcement of or the priority of a mortgage security in respect of land or goods;
(iv) the obligation of a secured party (or receiver) to

<<<

 exercise its power of sale in good faith and to obtain on sale the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale for the asset sold.
Service of process/commencement of proceedings
C o m m e n c e m e n t o f p ro c e e d in g in N e

<<<

 w Z e a la n d a g a in s t the N e w Z e a la n d G u a ra n to r
Whilst a New Zealand court has jurisdiction over any New Zealand company, if the Security Agent commenced proceedings against the New Zealand Guarantor in New Zealand, it is

<<<

 possible that an application could be made by the New Zealand Guarantor to stay proceedings on the basis that New Zealand is not the most appropriate or convenient forum for the action. Even if the New Zealand court concludes it is an appropriate

<<<

 or convenient forum, further difficulties may arise in seeking to found a claim before a New Zealand court upon a breach of requirements of U.S. statutes, including in particular seeking to enforce liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal or

<<<

 state securities laws. Whether a New Zealand court will apply a foreign statute generally depends on the relevant choice of law rule (directing that the law of that foreign country will govern the matter) and the legal category to which the

<<<

 courts assign the foreign cause of action. For public policy reasons, a New Zealand court will ordinarily decline to apply a foreign statute which is a penal, revenue or public law of the foreign country.
Additionally, a New Zealand court will

<<<

 not give effect to a choice of law provision or an agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of a certain court if to do so would be contrary to public policy including without limitation, where a New Zealand court considers that the choice of

<<<

 governing law is not bona fide (and is not connected with the commercial realities of the guarantee) or legal.
Enforcement of U.S. judgments
The New Zealand Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1934 provides the primary statutory basis for

<<<

 the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements in New Zealand. However, neither the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1934 nor any other legislation provides for the recognition and enforcement in New Zealand of judgements of a

<<<

 New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City (or any appellate court with jurisdiction over any such court) as New Zealand and the US have no formal arrangements for enforcing judgments.
Accordingly

<<<

, whether a judgment of such a court would be recognised and given effect to by a New Zealand court, following the commencement of a new action in the courts of New Zealand but without
343

any re-trial or re-examination of the merits of the

<<<

 action, would be determined by applicable common law principles. Under those principles this would depend upon a number of factors, including whether:
(i) the relevant New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting

<<<

 in New York City (or any appellate court with jurisdiction over any such court) (as the case may be) had jurisdiction over the defendant determined in accordance with the rules of private international law applied by the New Zealand courts

<<<

 (broadly, if the defendant has submitted or agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts or is resident or present in that jurisdiction);
(ii) the judgment of such court was (1) final and conclusive; (2) for a debt or definite sum of

<<<

 money; (3) not in respect of taxes, fines or penalties; (4) not obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to natural justice; and (5) not contrary to New Zealand public policy; and
(iii) service of process in relation to the proceedings in

<<<

 the relevant U.S. court were properly effected in accordance with New Zealand law.
In addition, subject to certain exceptions, enforcement in New Zealand courts of a U.S. court judgment must be sought within six years of the date the U.S. court

<<<

 judgment became enforceable in the United States.
There is doubt as to the enforceability in New Zealand courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions predicated upon liability provisions of the United States federal or state securities

<<<

 laws where the action is not in respect of purely civil liability, i.e. it is, instead, in respect of a penalty or tax. More generally, however, it is not contrary to public policy to enforce a judgment merely because the cause of action on

<<<

 which it was obtained is not known to New Zealand law.
Insolvency proceedings
In New Zealand the usual processes for dealing with corporate insolvency are very similar to those in Australia. These processes are voluntary administration, liquidation

<<<

, receivership, statutory management, creditors' compromises and creditors' schemes of arrangement, a summary of each of which is set out below.
V oluntary a d m in istra tio n
The New Zealand Companies Act 1993 provides for the appointment

<<<

 of a voluntary administrator to an insolvent company (or a company that may in the future become insolvent). The New Zealand voluntary administration regime is generally modelled on the equivalent Australian regime and the provisions of the

<<<

 Companies Act are substantially the same as the equivalent provisions under Australian law. Voluntary administration is intended to maximise the chances of a company (or its business) continuing in existence or, if that is not possible, providing

<<<

 a better return for creditors than immediate liquidation.
A company can be placed into administration by its directors, a liquidator, a secured creditor who has a security interest over substantially the whole of the company's property or the

<<<

 Court on the application of a creditor or certain others.
On the appointment of an administrator a moratorium on enforcement action commences such that creditors cannot take steps to enforce any debts or security against the company without

<<<

 the consent of the administrator or the leave of the Court. However, the moratorium does not apply to secured creditors who hold a security interest over all or substantially all of the company's assets, if those creditors elect to enforce

<<<

 their security interest within the 10 working days after the company goes into administration. Nor does the moratorium apply to secured creditors who have already taken steps to enforce the security interest prior to the administration.
During

<<<

 the administration, the administrator has control over the company's business and property (except for company property in respect of which a secured creditor has appointed a receiver). The administrator can manage and dispose of any business

<<<

 or property and can perform any function and exercise any power on the company's behalf that the company could perform if it were not in an administration.
The moratorium will expire when the creditors vote (at the ``watershed meeting'') to

<<<

 return the company to its directors, to appoint a liquidator or to execute a deed of company arrangement. The watershed meeting must be held within 25 working days after the commencement of the administration (or longer if the Court has approved

<<<

 an extension to the convening period). If a deed of company arrangement is
344

approved by a majority in number representing 75% by value of creditors it is binding on all unsecured creditors as well as secured creditors who have voted in

<<<

 favor of the deed of company arrangement.
L iq u id a tio n
Liquidation is a statutory winding up process which can be initiated by the company's shareholders, directors or by the Court (on the application by, among others, creditors if the

<<<

 Court is satisfied the company is unable to pay its debts). Liquidation involves the realisation and distribution of a company's assets. Liquidators are appointed and operate in accordance with Part 16 of the New Zealand Companies Act 1993

<<<

.
Once appointed, the liquidator takes over the management of the company, realises its assets, pays its creditors and distributes the balance (if any) to the company's shareholders. A liquidator has limited powers to carry on the business of

<<<

 the company. A liquidator is able to challenge insolvent transactions, or transactions at undervalue, terminate certain contracts, disclaim onerous property, compromise claims and sell the company's assets and/or business.
Secured creditors

<<<

 generally stand outside the liquidation process and separately realise their secured property. To the extent there is a shortfall, the secured creditor can claim in the liquidation as an unsecured creditor for that shortfall. Similarly, if

<<<

 there is a surplus after realisation the secured creditor must account to the liquidator for that surplus.
After realising the company's assets, the liquidator must apply the proceeds towards their own fees and expenses, followed by paying

<<<

 preferential creditors (generally in the nature of employee payments and taxes) and then general unsecured creditors. Each creditor will share in the proceeds proportionately.
R ece ivership
In New Zealand, receivership is the most common form

<<<

 of enforcement procedure in respect of insolvent companies who have granted security over their assets. Receivership is initiated by a secured party in relation to some or all of the assets of the company over which that secured party holds

<<<

 a security interest. The right to appoint receivers, and the scope of a receiver's powers, are generally a matter of contract under the terms of the relevant security agreement. The appointment and conduct of receivers is also regulated by

<<<

 the New Zealand Receiverships Act 1993 and the common law.
The appointment of a receiver does not create a moratorium in relation to the company or its assets and other creditors can continue to enforce their rights and remedies against the

<<<

 company or its assets subject to the prior ranking rights of the secured creditor.
A receiver is under a statutory duty to act: (i) in good faith and for a proper purpose; and (ii) must exercise his/her powers in the best interests of the appointing

<<<

 secured creditor. To the extent consistent with those duties, a receiver must exercise his/her powers with a reasonable regard to the insolvent company, others claiming an interest in the receivership property, unsecured creditors and guarantors

<<<

 of the insolvent company.
The receiver owes residual duties to the company, its sureties, unsecured creditors and shareholders to have reasonable regard to the interests of those persons.
S tatutory m an ag em en t
A statutory manager may be

<<<

 appointed to a New Zealand company pursuant to the New Zealand Corporations (Investigations and Management) Act 1989. Statutory managers are only rarely appointed in cases of corporate insolvency.
Statutory managers are appointed where it is

<<<

 considered by the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority that the company is acting fraudulently or recklessly or that it is necessary to protect the interests of shareholders or creditors or for any other reason in the public interest and

<<<

 such interests cannot be adequately protected in another way.
While a company is under statutory management, there is a moratorium which prevents any proceedings or enforcement action being taken or continued by any person (including secured

<<<

 creditors) against the corporation without the statutory manager's consent. There is also a prohibition on the transfer or removal of any assets of the company without the statutory manager's consent.
345

A statutory manager has broad powers

<<<

 to manage and carry on the business of the company, challenge insolvent transactions, terminate certain contracts, disclaim onerous property, compromise claims and sell its assets and/or business.
A statutory manager is also entitled to suspend

<<<

, in whole or in part, the payment of any debts or the discharge of any obligation. There is no limit on the period during which the moratorium or suspension may continue.
C re d ito rs ' co m p ro m ise s
A creditors' compromise is a binding

<<<

 arrangement between an insolvent company and its creditors concerning payment of the company's debts other than in accordance with the strict legal rights of those creditors. The compromise may involve the suspension or deferral of payments

<<<

, the acceptance of a lesser sum as full and final settlement or instalment arrangements, or the conversion of debt into equity.
Compromise arrangements are made under Part 14 of the New Zealand Companies Act 1993. The directors, a receiver

<<<

 or a liquidator may propose a compromise as of right, and a creditor or a shareholder may propose a compromise with the leave of the Court. Part 14 requires a distinction to be made between classes of creditors. Although each class of creditors

<<<

 vote on the proposal separately, the resolution must be the same for each class. Each class must approve the proposal by a majority by number and by 75% in value of creditors who voted in that class. Unless a proposal provides otherwise, the

<<<

 approval of the compromise is conditional upon all classes voting in favor of the proposal.
A compromise once approved by the required majority of creditors, will bind all creditors to whom notice of the compromise proposal was given, including

<<<

 even those that do not agree with it. However, a creditor who voted against the compromise may challenge the compromise by applying to the Court within 10 working days after notice of the result of the voting was given to the creditor. If the

<<<

 Court is satisfied that the compromise is unfairly prejudicial to that creditor or the class of creditors to which that creditor belongs, the Court may make an order that the creditor is not bound by the compromise.
Until the compromise is

<<<

 approved, there is no moratorium on creditors taking enforcement steps against the company.
C o u rt-a pp rove d sch e m e s o f a rran ge m en t a n d co m p ro m ise s
A rarely used process in the insolvency of companies is a Court-approved

<<<

 compromise, a scheme of arrangement or an amalgamation under Part 15 of the New Zealand Companies Act 1993. Part 15 allows a compromise to be approved by the Court outside of the Part 14 process discussed under ``Creditors' Compromises'' section

<<<

 above.
A Court may, on the application of a company or any of its shareholders or creditors, order that a compromise, arrangement or amalgamation be binding on the company and on such other persons or classes of persons including creditors

<<<

 as the Court may specify. Any order may be made on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit. However, as the Court has a duty to ensure that the rights of affected creditors are adequately protected, the Court is likely to order that

<<<

 the creditors vote on the proposed compromise before it considers whether to approve it.
Limitations on enforcement under insolvency legislation
L iq u id a tio n
A liquidator must ascertain and realise the company's assets. Where a company

<<<

 is placed in liquidation its recent transactions will in the normal course be placed under scrutiny by the liquidator. A liquidator has wide statutory powers to do this. As an example, and as discussed in more detail below, a liquidator has

<<<

 the power to void certain insolvent transactions between the company and a creditor, void certain security granted by a company in favor of a creditor, recover any excess paid by a company to a creditor in a transaction at an undervalue and

<<<

 make a claim against a director who has breached his or her duties under the Companies Act.
Upon liquidation, existing court proceedings are automatically stayed, and proceedings against the company cannot be commenced or continued without

<<<

 leave of the court or the liquidator's consent.
346

V oidable tran sactio n s
The liquidator has the ability to set aside insolvent transactions entered into during the specified period. An insolvent transaction is one entered into when the

<<<

 company is unable to pay its due debts and which enables a person to receive more than would have been likely in liquidation. The specified period is two years before the date of commencement of the liquidation (``specified period''). In respect

<<<

 of transactions occurring within the six months prior to the commencement of the liquidation (the ``restricted period''), there is a presumption that the company was insolvent at the time the transaction occurred.
V oidable ch a rg e s
The

<<<

 liquidator has the ability to set aside a charge or security interest entered into during the specified period if immediately after the charge or security interest was granted, the company was unable to pay its due debts (except to the extent

<<<

 of valuable consideration given at or after the time of the granting of the charge or security interest). In respect of a charge or security interest created within the restricted period (as defined above), there is a presumption that the company

<<<

 was insolvent at the time the charge or security interest was granted.
P ro ce ss fo r s e ttin g a sid e v o id a b le tra n sa ctio n s o r ch a rg e s
A liquidator must give notice to a recipient creditor of its challenge to a transaction

<<<

 or charge, and a creditor must object to the liquidator's notice within 20 working days. A creditor can oppose a liquidator's challenge on limited bases, such as that the creditor gave value and acted in good faith, or that the company and

<<<

 the creditor had a continuing business relationship which operates to set-off value given and received over the course of the relationship.
T ransactions a t an u nd ervalu e
A liquidator may recover any excess paid by a company to a creditor

<<<

 in a transaction at an undervalue during the specified period, in circumstances where the value received by the company was less than the value received by the person, and the company was unable to pay its due debts when it entered the transaction

<<<

 (or become unable to pay its due debts as a result of entering into the transaction).
O ther g ro u n d s
A guarantee or security interest granted by a company may also be set aside on other grounds under New Zealand law. For instance a guarantee

<<<

 may be unenforceable against the guaranteeing company if the directors of the guarantor did not comply with their duties to act in good faith for the benefit of the guaranteeing company (or where permitted by its constitution, its holding company

<<<

) and for a proper purpose in giving the guarantee, in circumstances where the party relying on the guarantee knew of or suspected (or ought to have known or suspected) the breach. In addition, if the granting of a guarantee or security interest

<<<

 is a major transaction or involves financial assistance and there has been a failure to obtain shareholder or entitled person approval/agreement as required by the New Zealand Companies Act 1993 (or the company's constitution), it may be set

<<<

 aside on the basis that the action taken by the company or the board (in breach of the Companies Act or constitution) is unfairly prejudicial to the relevant shareholder or entitled person applying to the Court.

With respect to the New Zealand Guarantor, Noteholders will need to be particularly mindful of the following risks given these aspects of New Zealand law and the risk factors identified earlier

<<<

 in these listing particulars:
 the Guarantee and the security given by the New Zealand Guarantor will be at risk of being set aside if the New Zealand Guarantor is placed in liquidation within the specified period (as defined above). This

<<<

 risk will be greater if the liquidation occurs during the restricted period (as defined above), as there will be a presumption that the New Zealand Guarantor was unable to pay its debts at the time of issue of the Notes; and
 if the Guarantee

<<<

 from the New Zealand Guarantor is set aside, Noteholders may be left without a claim on the New Zealand Guarantor and will have to rely solely on a claim against the Issuer and the other Subsidiary Guarantors, and any payments received from

<<<

 the New Zealand Guarantor may have to be repaid.

SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES
The Issuers are private limited companies incorporated under the laws of Norway. The Guarantors are incorporated in Norway, Australia

<<<

, Austria, France, Germany and New Zealand.
Many of our directors, officers and other executives are neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, most of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it

<<<

 may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons or us or to enforce against them or us judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state

<<<

 securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we and the Guarantors have appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process

<<<

 within Norway and Guarantor jurisdictions upon those persons or us or over our subsidiaries provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 196

<<<

5 is complied with.
If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against any of the Issuers, us, any Guarantor or any security provider, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though

<<<

 the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which we, the Issuer and the Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed

<<<

 to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.
Norway
Norwegian courts will, as a general rule, not recognize or enforce judgments rendered by a foreign court unless provided by Norwegian law Norway has entered

<<<

 into a bilateral or multilateral treaty with the relevant country or countries regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments and subject to the provisions of Section 19-16 of the Norwegian Dispute Act of 2005 No. 90 (T v is te lo v

<<<

 e n ), (the ``Dispute Act''). Pursuant to the Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the ``Lugano Convention''), which is incorporated into Norwegian national law, Norwegian courts will recognize

<<<

 as a valid judgment, and enforce, any final civil judgment obtained in a foreign court in a state that is a party to the Lugano Convention, without a further examination of the merits of the case. The exceptions stated in the Lugano Convention

<<<

 itself will apply.
If there is no treaty between Norway and the relevant jurisdiction regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments, or the relevant treaty is not applicable, a judgment rendered by a foreign court (e.g., the courts

<<<

 of United States) may nevertheless be recognized and enforced in Norway without further examination of the merits of the case, provided that the foreign proceedings and the judgment itself fulfil the conditions stated in the Norwegian Enforcement

<<<

 Act of 1992 No. 86 (T v a n g s fu llb y rd e ls e s lo v e n ) and the Dispute Act. Where a Norwegian party has accepted the jurisdiction of a foreign court in a written agreement, any judgment rendered pursuant to that agreement will be enforceable

<<<

 in Norway in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4-6 and 19-16 of the Dispute Act. However, a judgment will not be recognized in Norway if such recognition would be contrary to mandatory laws or to Norwegian public policy considerations

<<<

.
Australia
The United States and Australia do not have a treaty which provides for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil matters. Further, United States courts are not listed in the Foreign Judgments Regulations 

<<<

1992 made under the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 of Australia. Therefore, there is no statutory recognition or statutory enforcement in Australia of any judgment obtained in a court in the United States. Instead, a judgment made by a U.S. court

<<<

 can only be enforced in Australia under the common law regime.
Under that regime, any final, conclusive and unsatisfied judgment in p e rs o n a m (that is, that imposes a personal obligation on the defendant) of a U.S. court which has jurisdiction

<<<

 as determined under the rules of private international law of Australia, and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty), and is between the

<<<

 same parties, may be enforceable by the judgment creditor against the judgment debtor by action in
348

the Australian courts (without re-examination of the merits of the issues determined by the proceedings in the U.S. court) unless certain

<<<

 circumstances apply, including:
 the proceeding in the U.S. court involved a denial of the principles of natural justice recognized by the courts of Australia;
 the U.S. judgment is contrary to the public policy of Australia;
 the U.S. judgment

<<<

 was obtained by fraud; or
 the U.S. judgment includes multiple or punitive damages or where the proceedings in such court were of a penal nature.
Austria
According to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 79/1896 as last amended

<<<

 by Federal Law Gazette No. 69/2014; E x e k u tio n s o rd n u n g ), foreign judgments are only enforceable in Austria if the reciprocity is warranted by a bilateral or multilateral treaty between the countries involved or by a respective

<<<

 directive (V e ro rd n u n g ) of the Austrian government. The Republic of Austria and the United States have not entered into a treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered in either courts civil and commercial

<<<

 matters. In this regard, there is also no directive of the Austrian government in place. Therefore, the courts of Austria will not recognize and/or enforce a judgment obtained in the courts of the United States, be it a judgment rendered by

<<<

 a United States federal or state court. Accordingly, the subject matter upon which a judgment has been obtained in a United States federal or state court must be re-litigated before Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian Civil

<<<

 Procedure Laws (Z iv ilp ro z e s s v e rfa h re n ). A judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by an Austrian court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates, and an Austrian

<<<

 court has to re-hear the dispute. Only after having obtained a final judgment before an Austrian court can enforcement procedures be initiated under the Austrian Enforcement Act.
France
We have been advised by our French counsel that the United

<<<

 States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or

<<<

 state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, and which is enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.
A party in whose favor

<<<

 such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (e x e q u a tu r) in France before the relevant civil court (T rib u n a l d e G ra n d e In s ta n c e ) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.
Enforcement in France

<<<

 of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review

<<<

 by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment):
 such U.S. judgment was issued by a court that had jurisdiction over the case;
 such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules (o rd re p u b lic

<<<

 in te rn a tio n a l), both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights;
 such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law (i.e., the parties did not submit the dispute to a foreign court

<<<

 in order to maliciously avoid the application of French law);
 such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France; and
 in addition, please note that a clear position has

<<<

 not yet been established in French case law as to whether proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the foreign judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as this judgment may have an impact on

<<<

 enforcement in France of the foreign judgment.
349

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and

<<<

 will thus be declared enforceable in France after all remedies have been exhausted. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.
In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely

<<<

 affected under certain circumstances by French criminal law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French ordinance No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents

<<<

 and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or

<<<

 administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France

<<<

 or from French persons.
Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as most recently modified by law No. 2014-344 of March 17, 2014) can limit under certain

<<<

 circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.
Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts

<<<

 may refuse to apply foreign law or part of foreign law designated by the applicable French rule of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to

<<<

 contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts) or in case of overriding mandatory rules. Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws

<<<

, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.
Pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts

<<<

 in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French persons (article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection

<<<

 with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant

<<<

 or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to recent case law, the French courts' jurisdiction over French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an

<<<

 action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to this recent case law, a French defendant can no longer

<<<

 challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal on the basis of article 15 of the French civil code in circumstances where the foreign tribunal has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and foreign claimants may waive their rights respectively

<<<

 to benefit from the provisions of articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.
Our French counsel has also advised us that the French Supreme Court (C o u r d e

<<<

 c a s s a tio n ) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid on the ground

<<<

 that it was discretionary (p o te s ta tiv e ). Accordingly any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing

<<<

 an action before the French courts. However this decision was rendered on the basis of the Brussels Regulation and as such would not apply to non-intra-EU disputes.
Germany
The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing

<<<

 for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final and conclusive judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment based on civil liability

<<<

, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action

<<<

 of exequatur before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Z iv ilp ro z e s s o rd n u n g ). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate

<<<

 and review
350

the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including but not limited

<<<

 to the following:
 the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law;
 the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;
 the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against

<<<

 an unduly or untimely served complaint;
 the judgment was not given in default of appearance and the defendant invokes such default or the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings properly or within sufficient

<<<

 time to enable him to arrange for his or her defence;
 the judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment given in Germany or a previous, recognizable foreign judgment recognition in Germany or the proceedings leading to such judgment are

<<<

 irreconcilable with proceedings that were filed (re c h ts h a n g ig ) in Germany previously;
 the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down

<<<

 before the judgment of the U.S. court;
 the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial foundations of German law (e.g. o rd re p u b lic ) , including without limitation, fundamental rights (G ru n

<<<

 d re c h te ) guaranteed by virtue of the German Basic Law (G ru n d g e s e tz ); and
 generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.
Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received

<<<

 an enforcement or exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U

<<<

.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful under all circumstances. In particular, the remedies need to be of a specific kind and type for which an

<<<

 enforcement procedure exists under German law. Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date on which such foreign judgment became res judicata, a defence against execution may arise.
If an original action is brought before a German court

<<<

, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S.

<<<

 law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German public policy.
In particular, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages is usually denied by German courts as incompatible

<<<

 with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.
Enforcement

<<<

 is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally.
German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil

<<<

 procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties

<<<

 to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery

<<<

 process exists under German law.
New Zealand
There is doubt as to the enforceability in New Zealand courts of judgments of U.S. courts, obtained in actions predicated upon the liability provisions of the United States federal or state securities

<<<

 laws where the action is not in respect of purely civil liability, i.e. it is, instead, in respect of a penalty or tax. More generally, however, it is not contrary to public policy to enforce a judgment merely because the cause of action on

<<<

 which it was obtained is not known to New Zealand law.
351

The New Zealand Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1934 provides the primary statutory basis for the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements in New Zealand. However

<<<

, neither the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1934 nor any other legislation provides for the recognition and enforcement in New Zealand of judgements of a New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting

<<<

 in New York City (or any appellate court with jurisdiction over any such court) as New Zealand and the US have no formal arrangements for enforcing judgments.
Accordingly, whether a judgment of such a court would be recognised and given effect

<<<

 to by a New Zealand court, following the commencement of a new action in the courts of New Zealand but without any re-trial or re-examination of the merits of the action, would be determined by applicable common law principles. Under those

<<<

 principles this would depend upon a number of factors, including whether:
(iv) the relevant New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City (or any appellate court with jurisdiction over any such

<<<

 court) (as the case may be) had jurisdiction over the defendant, determined in accordance with the rules of private international law applied by the New Zealand courts (broadly, if the defendant has submitted or agreed to submit to the jurisdiction

<<<

 of the courts or is resident or present in that jurisdiction);
(v) the judgment of such court was (1) final and conclusive; (2) for a debt or definite sum of money; (3) not in respect of taxes, fines or penalties; (4) not obtained by fraud

<<<

 or in a manner contrary to natural justice; and (5) not contrary to New Zealand public policy; and
(vi) service of process in relation to the proceedings in the relevant U.S. court were properly effected in accordance with New Zealand law.

<<<


In addition, subject to certain exceptions, enforcement in New Zealand courts of a U.S. court judgment must be sought within six years of the date the U.S. court judgment became enforceable in the United States.
Luxembourg
Although there is

<<<

 no treaty between Luxembourg and the United States regarding the reciprocal enforcement of judgments, a valid, final and conclusive judgment against the Temporary Notes Issuer, obtained from a state or federal court of the United States, which

<<<

 judgment remains in full force and effect, may be enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction in Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (e x e q u a tu r) as set out in the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg

<<<

 New Civil Procedure Code. Pursuant to Luxembourg case law, the granting of e x e q u a tu r is subject to the following requirements:
(a) the U.S. judgment must be enforceable in the United States;
(b) the U.S. court awarding the judgment must

<<<

 have had jurisdiction both according to its own laws and to the Luxembourg conflict of jurisdictions rules;
(c) the U.S. court procedure must have been regular according to the laws of the United States and must not violate the rights of defence

<<<

;
(d) the U.S. court must have applied the law which is designated by Luxembourg conflict of law rules, or, at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying these rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain

<<<

 that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court);
(e) the U.S. judgment must not contravene Luxembourg international public policy or must not have been given in proceedings of a tax or criminal

<<<

 nature; and
(f) the U.S. judgment must not have been rendered subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg law
(fra u de a la lo i).
Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts do currently not review the merits of a foreign judgment even

<<<

 though there is no statutory prohibition for such review.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Norske

<<<

 Skogindustrier ASA (``the company'') and its subsidiaries (``the group'') manufacture, distribute and sell publication paper. This includes newsprint and magazine paper.
The interim financial statements were authorised for issue by the board

<<<

 of directors in Norske Skogindustrier ASA on 22 April 2015.
Norske Skog's accounting treatment of embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway has been changed with effect from 1 January 2015.
All amounts in the interim financial statements

<<<

 are presented in NOK million unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding, there may be differences in the summation of columns and rows.
The table below shows the applied average (un-weighted monthly) quarterly foreign exchange rates (Q1 2015

<<<

 and Q4 2014) and the closing exchange rate (31 March 2015, 31 December 2015 and 1 January 2014) for the most important currencies for the Norske Skog group.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The interim financial statements of Norske Skog have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 In te rim F in a n c ia l R e p o rtin g . The interim

<<<

 financial statements do not include all information required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for 2014. The interim financial statements are unaudited.
The accounting

<<<

 policies applied in the preparation of the interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, except for the adaptation of amended standards

<<<

 and new interpretations, which are mandatory from 1 January 2015. These changes are described in the annual financial statements for 2014.
The group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is

<<<

 not yet mandatory.
From the first quarter of 2015, Norske Skog has changed its accounting practice for embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway. The new accounting policy is assessed to result in financial reporting that is more aligned

<<<

 to the rationale for requiring separation of embedded derivatives and will accordingly result in more relevant and less volatile information being presented to the users of the financial statements. In accordance with IAS 8 A c c o u n tin

<<<

 g P o lic ie s , C h a n g e s in A c c o u n tin g E s tim a te s , 2014 figures in the condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated

<<<

 statement of cash flows have been restated. The implementation effects of the amended practices are further described in Note 7.

3. ESTIMATES, JUDGEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Preparation of interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS implies

<<<

 use of estimates, which are based on judgements and assumptions that affect the application of accounting principles and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual amounts might differ from such estimates.

 a n d e q u ip m e n t
Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life and goodwill are not subject to amortisation, but are tested annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets that are subject to amortisation

<<<

 are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in

<<<

 use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) model for calculating the present value of future cash flows. Calculation of

<<<

 value in use requires use of estimates. There was no indication that further impairments or reversals of previous impairments should be made at 31 March 2015.

 sheet and valued at fair value. Fair values of commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity contracts which are not traded in an active marked, are assessed through valuation techniques. Norske Skog has one long-term energy contract

<<<

 in New Zealand. The electricity prices for long-term electricity contracts in New Zealand are not directly observable in the market for the whole contract length. Price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used in the estimation

<<<

 of fair value. The group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. See Note 9 in the annual financial statements for 2014 for more

<<<

 information regarding the calculation of fair value of derivatives.
P ro visio n s
Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive

<<<

 obligation as a result of past events; an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions for future environmental and dismantling liabilities are based

<<<

 on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment. See Note 2 in the annual financial statements for 2014 for a more thorough description of important accounting estimates and assumptions impacting the preparation of financial

<<<

 statements.
C o n tin g e n t lia b ilitie s
Norske Skog is an international company that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and contracting parties as well as assessments

<<<

 from public authorities in each country it operates. Norske Skog has continued the process related to simplification of the group's corporate structure in 2015. The simplification of the group's corporate structure in combination with changes

<<<

 in individual countries' tax laws could increase the group's tax exposure. However, due to completed reorganisations and tax assessments, the overall tax exposure has decreased during the last years.

 The remaining existing are structurally junior to the SSN and exchange notes.
More than 75% of the existing bond holders consented to the transactions, and approximately 45% of the existing bonds participated in the exchange offer. Norske Skog

 recognised a net gain in connection with the refinancing of NOK 869 million in first quarter 2015, included in Other financial items in the table above.
In January, prior to the offering of the SSN and the exchange offer, several changes in

<<<

 the Norske Skog corporate structure were made. Norske Skog AS was established as the issuer of the SSN, while Norske Skog Holding AS was established as the offeror of the exchange notes.

NET INTEREST-BEARING DEBT
Norske Skog has recognised

<<<

 an amount in the balance sheet as a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the first half of 2009. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 78 million is included in interest-bearing debt at

<<<

 31 March 2015. The corresponding figure at 31 December 2014 was NOK 174 million.
The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the lifetime of the debt that has

<<<

 been hedged. The change in the hedge reserve this quarter is due to realisation of a part of the hedge reserve as a consequence of the exchange offer.

Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists primarily of physical energy contracts. The fair value of commodity contracts is particularly sensitive to future fluctuations

<<<

 in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations.

Higher energy prices have a positive impact on fair value. Energy prices in New Zealand have increased in the

<<<

 short end of the price curve while the prices in the long end are virtually unchanged compared with the previous quarter.

Changes in the value of energy-/commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in contracts are presented in the income

<<<

 statement line Other gains and losses. Realised effects from financial energy contracts are also included in this accounting line.

Gains and losses on level 3 financial instruments recognised in the income statement, line item Other gains

<<<

 and losses, amounted to NOK 117 million in the first quarter of 2015 (NOK -1 8 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014).

Norske Skog has changed its accounting principle for embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway with effect from

 1 January 2015, with full retrospective application. Comparable figures for 2014

<<<

 AT FAIR VALUE (Continued)
have been restated. Since the change in accounting principle is applied retrospectively, the balance sheet at 1 January 2014 has been included in the interim financial statements for the first quarter of 2015.
The

<<<

 change in accounting principle regards which economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives that are considered closely related to a power purchase or sale contract between buyers and sellers in Norway. An embedded foreign currency

<<<

 derivative is closely related, and shall accordingly not be accounted for separately, if it is commonly used in the economic environment in which the transaction takes place. As of 1 January 2015, Norske Skog has changed its interpretation

<<<

 of what is considered an economic environment for the purpose of separation of embedded foreign currency derivatives in non-financial contracts, so that the Norwegian and Nordic power market is considered an economic environment for these purposes

<<<

. Norske Skog has assessed EUR to be a commonly used currency in the Norwegian and Nordic power market, including in long-term contracts to buy or sell physical power between buyers and sellers in this market. The energy market in Europe is

<<<

 further assessed to be an integrated economic environment where contracts to buy and sell power are commonly denominated in EUR. In addition, Norske Skog has reassessed and concluded that general inflation indexes in long-term physical energy

<<<

 purchase contracts may be considered closely related, and accordingly not required to be accounted for separately, when the purpose and effect of including them is to ensure that the prices in the contracts are adjusted to the general price

<<<

 level where the transaction takes place.
The comparable figures for 2014 in the condensed consolidated balance sheet have been restated. The following line items have been impacted in the condensed consolidated balance sheet: Deferred tax asset

<<<

, Retained earnings and other reserves, Other non-current liabilities and Other current liabilities. Retained earnings and other reserves were increased by NOK 185 million at 1 January 2014 (increased by NOK 130 million at 31 March 2014 and

<<<

 increased by NOK 212 million at 31 December 2014).

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal

<<<

 accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Norske Skogindustrier ASA are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated

<<<

 financial statements are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations from the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as adopted by the European Union (EU). They have been prepared under

<<<

 the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of biological assets, available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

Consolidation
a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities

<<<

 over which the group is deemed to have control. The group will have control if it has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, and has exposure to and the power to affect variable returns. Control is generally accompanying

<<<

 a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date at which control is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from the date on which such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions

<<<

, balances, income and expenses on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have

<<<

 been amended where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

b) Change in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of

<<<

 control are accounted for as equity transactions. Upon further acquisition of shares in subsidiaries from non-controlling interests, the

2. ACCOUNTING

<<<

 POLICIES (Continued) difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary, is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests

<<<

 are also recorded in equity.
c) Disposal of subsidiaries When the group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised

<<<

 in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other

<<<

 comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to

<<<

 profit or loss where appropriate.
d) Associates Associates are all entities over which the group exercises significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% to 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates

<<<

 are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date

<<<

 of acquisition. The group's share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as Share of profit in associated companies and is assigned to the carrying value of the investment, together with the group's share of

<<<

 other comprehensive income in the associated company. When the group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses,

<<<

 unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and its associates are recognised in the consolidated financial statements only to the extent of

<<<

 unrelated investors' interests in the associates. At each reporting date, the group determines whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the group calculates the amount of

<<<

 impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognises the amount as Share of profit in associated companies. Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised

<<<

 in the income statement. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or

<<<

 loss where appropriate.
Segment reporting Reportable segments The activities in the group are divided into two operating segments: publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia. The segment structure is in line with the group's

<<<

 operating model implemented in 2014. The operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating

<<<

 resources, making strategic decisions and assessing performance of the group's mills, has been identified as corporate management. The mills have a direct reporting line to corporate management.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Accounting policies applied in the segment reporting Recognition, measurement and classification applied in the segment reporting are consistent with the accounting

<<<

 principles applied for the consolidated income statement and balance sheet. The option in IFRS 8 allowing different accounting policies to be applied in the segment reporting and group reporting is, for transparency reasons, not applied in

<<<

 Norske Skog.
Performance measurement
The group assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of gross operating earnings. These items exclude the effects of expenditure not deemed to be part of the regular operating

<<<

 activities of the segment, such as restructuring expenses, impairments, gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in fair value of certain energy contracts, embedded derivatives in energy contracts and biological assets

<<<

.
Intercompany transactions The revenue reported per operating segment includes both sales to external parties and sales to other segments. Intra-segment sales are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. All sales transactions between

<<<

 operating segments are carried out at arm's length prices as if sold or transferred to independent third parties.
Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the

<<<

 group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic location in which the entity operates (the ``functional currency''). The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK, which is both the functional and presentational

<<<

 currency of the parent company.
b) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the entity's functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses

<<<

 resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses subject to

<<<

 hedge accounting and relating to currency positions qualifying as net investment hedges and which are hedge accounted, are booked as part of comprehensive income. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of accounts receivable/payable

<<<

 and unrealised gains/ losses on the same positions are recognised in Operating revenue/Cost of materials respectively. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of other items are recognised within Financial items. Foreign exchange gains

<<<

 and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement as Financial items.
c) Group companies The results and financial position of all group entities which have a functional currency different

<<<

 from the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
i. Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet,
ii. Income and expenses

<<<

 for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates, iii. All resulting exchange differences are booked to comprehensive income and presented in other
equity reserves.

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as

<<<

 hedges of such investments, are booked as part of comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves. When a foreign operation is fully or partially sold, such exchange differences are booked out of comprehensive income and recognised

<<<

 in the income statement line Other gains and losses as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings comprise mainly mills, machinery and office premises. All property, plant and equipment (PPE) is shown

<<<

 at historical cost less subsequent depreciation and impairments. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. The residual value of production equipment is defined as the realisable value after

<<<

 deduction of the estimated cost of dismantling and removal of the asset. If the estimated cost exceeds the estimated value, the net liability is added to the cost of the related asset, and a provision is recognised as a liability in the balance

<<<

 sheet. Borrowing costs, which are directly related to qualifying assets, are recognised as part of the acquisition cost for the qualifying asset. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset

<<<

, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repair

<<<

 and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued

<<<

 amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. The residual value and useful life of property, plant and equipment are reviewed and adjusted. Impairment test of property, plant and equipment are performed annually or more

<<<

 frequently if indicators of impairment are identified. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals

<<<

 are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount, and included in the income statement line Other gains and losses.
Biological assets Biological assets are measured upon initial recognition and at the end of each reporting

<<<

 period at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs, unless fair value cannot be reliably measured. A gain or loss arising on initial recognition, and from changes in fair value during a period, is reported in net profit or loss for the

<<<

 period in which it arises. When fair value cannot be reliably estimated, the asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of

<<<

 the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is

<<<

 tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made

<<<

 to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
F-28

)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
b) Patents and licenses
Patents and licenses have a finite useful life and are recognised at historical cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate

<<<

 the cost of patents and licences over their estimated useful lives.
c) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire the specific software and bring it into use, and amortised

<<<

 over their estimated useful lives. Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as they are incurred. Costs which are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products

<<<

 controlled by the group, and which are likely to generate economic benefits exceeding the costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of software development personnel and an appropriate portion

<<<

 of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets, which have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill

<<<

, are not subject to amortisation, but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable

<<<

. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purpose of

<<<

 assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable (cash-generating units). At each balance sheet date, the possibility of reversing impairment losses in prior periods is evaluated

<<<

 (except for goodwill).
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction

<<<

 and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Financial assets
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit

<<<

 or loss, loans and receivables, and available for sale. This classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re

<<<

-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss

<<<

 at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired principally for the purpose of short-term sale or if so designated by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless designated as hedges

<<<

. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they either are held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Non-financial commodity contracts where the relevant commodity is readily

<<<

 convertible to cash, and where the contracts are not for own use, fall within the scope of IAS 39 F in a n c ia l In s tru m e n ts -- re c o g n itio n a n d m e a s u re m e n t. Such contracts are treated as derivatives in accordance with

<<<

 IAS 39. Norske Skog has a long-term energy contract in New Zealand that is treated as a derivative and measured at fair value through profit or loss. Furthermore, the energy contracts in Norway are nominated in EUR and contain embedded derivatives

<<<

 that are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. See
F-29

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Notes 7, 8 and 9 for more information. Commodity contracts

<<<

 within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as current assets, unless they are expected to be realised more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. In that case, they are classified as non-current assets.
b) Loans and receivables Loans and

<<<

 receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments, which are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables maturing less than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as current assets

<<<

 and presented as Trade and other receivables or Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. Items maturing later than 12 months after the balance sheet date are presented within Other non-current assets.
c) Available-for-sale financial

<<<

 assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives, which are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the

<<<

 investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Derivatives and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method

<<<

 of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates derivatives as either: a) Hedging of a net investment in

<<<

 a foreign operation (net investment hedge), b) Derivatives at fair value through profit or loss. Upon inception of a transaction, the group documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk

<<<

 management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The group also documents its assessment of whether the derivatives that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged

<<<

 items. This assessment is documented both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis through the hedging period. Accounting for derivatives follows the intentions underlying the associated contract. At the time a contract is entered into, it

<<<

 is defined as either a hedging or a trading contract.
a) Net investment hedge Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss

<<<

 relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement line Financial items. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of or sold.
b) Derivatives

<<<

 at fair value through profit or loss Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any of these derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement. The fair value of quoted investments

<<<

 is based on the current market price. If the market for a financial asset is not active, the group applies valuation techniques to establish the fair value. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments

<<<

 which are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analyses defined to reflect the issuer's specific circumstances. Fair value includes the impact of credit risk and the adjustment for credit risk is dependent on whether the derivative

<<<

 is in the money (asset) or out of the money (liability) (see also Note 9).

 sheet.
Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or average purchase price. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw

<<<

 materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable

<<<

 variable selling expenses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently

<<<

 measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when objective evidence exists that the group will be unable to collect the entire

<<<

 amount due in accordance with the original terms of each receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that

<<<

 the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
Trade payables Trade payables

<<<

 are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest

<<<

 method.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and redemption value

<<<

 is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowing, using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable

<<<

 that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised

<<<

 as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities, unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for

<<<

 at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Interest costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

 POLICIES (Continued)
Bond loans
The value of bond loans in the balance sheet is reduced by holdings of Norske Skog bonds. Amounts above or below amortised costs upon buy-back are recognised in the income statement in the same period the buy

<<<

-back occurs.
Current and deferred income tax
The group's income tax expense includes current tax based on taxable profit in group companies, change of deferred income taxes for the financial period and adjustments to previous periods. Tax is

<<<

 recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,

<<<

 respectively.
The tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred

<<<

 tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their tax bases.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to

<<<

 the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities when the deferred

<<<

 tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current deferred tax liabilities.
Pension obligations, bonus arrangements

<<<

 and other employee benefits
a) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes. These are generally funded through payments to insurance companies, as determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The group has both defined

<<<

 benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is one which defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation

<<<

.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is

<<<

 calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate

<<<

 bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability, or alternatively a government bond interest rate if such bonds do

<<<

 not exist.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognised

<<<

 immediately in income.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. These contributions are made to publicly- or privately-administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory

<<<

, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made. These contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the period the contribution is related to. Prepaid contributions

<<<

 are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

) Share-based remuneration
Up to and including 2012, the group had a long-term incentive plan where the allocation of synthetic options to members of corporate management was based on the development of the company's share price in relation

<<<

 to a defined group of listed paper producers. The programme resulted in a cash payout if the options were exercised. The fair value of the liability was measured at each balance sheet date and on the settlement date. The plan was discontinued

<<<

 from 2013.
A revised long-term incentive plan was launched in 2014. The plan targets a positive share price development over a three-year period from 2014 to 2017 and allows the board to grant synthetic share options to the corporate management

<<<

 and other key employees, including managing directors of the Norwegian business units. During the vesting period, the liability recognised at each reporting date is the IFRS 2 fair value of the award at that date multiplied by the expired portion

<<<

 of the vesting period. See also Note 12.
c) Bonus arrangements
The group accrues for bonus arrangements when there exists a contractual obligation, or past practice has created a constructive obligation.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental

<<<

 restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required

<<<

 to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise mainly employee termination payments. Restructuring costs are costs which are not related to the ongoing operations. This includes for example

<<<

 severance (redundancy) payments, early retirement or other arrangements for employees leaving the company, external costs relating to coaching, counselling and assistance finding new jobs, or external costs to lawyers and legal advisors in

<<<

 relation to the de-manning process, and lease termination penalties. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Salary which is earned while the employee contributes to the ongoing operations is not classified as restructuring

<<<

 costs. This includes for example salary in the notice period when the employee is working during the notice period, or bonuses earned whilst the employee contributes to the normal operations. These are booked as normal employee benefit expenses

<<<

. Costs for projects related to improvements are generally ordinary operating costs.
Where a number of similar obligations exist, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations

<<<

 as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure

<<<

 required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised

<<<

 within Financial items.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the group's activities. Revenue is shown net of value

<<<

 added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group. The group's revenue consists almost exclusively of the sale of goods, and the principle for recognition of revenue is the same for newsprint and magazine

<<<

 paper.
F-33

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred

<<<

 to the buyer. This will depend upon the buyer's delivery terms and will be in the range from the finalisation of the production to delivery of the goods to the buyer.
The group's terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2010, which are the

<<<

 official rules for the interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Chamber of Commerce. The timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on these delivery terms. The group's sales are covered by the following main categories

<<<

 of terms:
 ``D'' terms, where the group delivers the goods to the purchaser at the agreed destination, usually the purchaser's premises. The point of sale is when the goods are delivered to the purchaser. If the customer is invoiced before

<<<

 delivery of the goods purchased, revenue is only recognised if the customer has taken over a significant part of the gain and loss potential related to those goods,
 ``C'' terms, where the group arranges and pays for the external transport

<<<

 of the goods, but the group no longer bears any responsibility for the goods once they have been handed over to the transporter in accordance with the terms of the contract. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter

<<<

 contracted by the seller,
 ``F'' terms, where the purchaser arranges and pays for the transport. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the purchaser.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised

<<<

 when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. This is the interest rate that gives a net present value of the cash flow from the loan that is equal to its

<<<

 carrying value.
Leases
Leases in which the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis

<<<

 over the period of the lease.
Leases relating to property and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet to the lower

<<<

 of the fair value of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charge and reduction of the outstanding liability, giving a constant periodic rate of interest on the

<<<

 remaining balance of the liability. The leased property is depreciated according to the same principles applied for other non-current assets. The corresponding rental obligation, net of finance charges, is included in other long-term payables

<<<

. If the leasing period is shorter than the useful life of the asset and it is unlikely that the group will purchase the asset at the end of the leasing period, the asset is depreciated over the leasing period.
Government grants
Government grants

<<<

 (except for emission rights, described below) are recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grants on a systematic basis to the costs that they are intended to compensate for. Government grants in the form of compensation

<<<

 for losses which have already been incurred, or in the form of direct financial support which is not directly related to future costs, are recognised as income in the same period as they are awarded.
Government grants related to assets are

<<<

 presented in the balance sheet as deferred income or as a reduction of the cost price of the assets the grant relates to. The grant is then recognised in the income

Emission Rights There is no accounting standard or interpretation in IFRS regarding

<<<

 the accounting treatment for emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. Received allowances are recognised in the balance sheet as intangible assets at the market value on the date the rights are granted. The difference between fair

<<<

 value and the nominal amount paid for the rights is recognised in the balance as a government grant (deferred income). Emissions are recognised in the income statement as Cost of materials, and the government grant (deferred revenue) is recognised

<<<

 concurrently with emission costs. Unused credits (deferred income) and used allowances are netted against the carrying amount of intangible asset recognised in the balance sheet, when the individual contracts for emission allowances fall due

<<<

 for settlement. If the received allowances are sufficient to cover the company's emissions, there will be no net cost or net income in gross operating earnings. If it is necessary to acquire additional allowances on the open market, a provision

<<<

 is made based on actual emissions. If the number of allowances received exceeds actual consumption, the surplus is sold in the market. The gain/loss from the sale is presented as Other gains and losses.

IFRS 11 removes the option for jointly controlled entities to use proportionate consolidation. Instead, the equity method of accounting must be used. The standard specifies two main categories of joint control: joint ventures and joint operations

<<<

. For joint ventures, joint control is recognised in accordance with the equity method, but for joint operations, the parties shall recognise their rights in the assets and liabilities included in the collaboration. The standard has been adopted

<<<

 with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities
The standard contains disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities

<<<

, including joint ventures, associated companies, special purpose entities and other off balance sheet entities. The standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.

<<<


IAS 27 Separate financial statements (revised) The rules for consolidated financial statements are replaced by the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12. What remains of IAS 27 is limited to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates

 significant impact on the financial statements.
IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures (revised) As a consequence of the new IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, IAS 28 has been renamed, and the standard now describes the application of the equity

<<<

 method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates. The standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IAS 32-- Financial instruments: presentation

<<<

 (amendment) The amendments clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities in the balance sheet. The standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on

<<<

 the financial statements.
IFRIC 21-- Levies The group has adopted IFRIC 21 Levies with a date of initial application of 1 January 2014. The group operates in a number of countries where it is subject to government levies. The interpretation

<<<

 clarifies that a levy is not recognised until the obligation event specified in the legislation occurs, even if there is no realistic opportunity to avoid the obligation. The standard has not had a significant impact on the financial statements

<<<

.
New standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2015. None of these has been early adopted

<<<

 in 2014. New standards and amendments that are expected to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements are listed below:
IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition

<<<

 and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting

<<<

 requirements. IT also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. The standard is mandatory for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 or later. The group has not fully assessed the impact

<<<

 of the adoption of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including

<<<

 IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes. The standard is mandatory for annual periods beginning 1 January 2017 or later. A final analysis of the consequences of IFRS 15 has not yet been completed

<<<

. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations, not yet effective, that are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Important accounting estimates and assumptions The preparation of consolidated financial statements

<<<

 in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions for the future. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the group's accounting policies. Estimates and assumptions, which

<<<


F-36

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) represent a substantial risk for significant changes in the capitalised value of assets and liabilities during the

<<<

 coming financial year, are discussed below.
a) Critical judgment in applying the group's accounting policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions

<<<

 that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosures of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Norske Skog has for instance applied judgment when identifying and recognising

<<<

 embedded derivatives, when choosing to present certain items as ``Other gains and losses ``as separate line items and presenting profit or loss from associated companies after operating earnings. It is important to note that the use of a different

<<<

 set of assumptions for the presentation of the consolidated financial statements could have resulted in significant changes in the line items presented.
b) Estimated decline in value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (PPE

<<<

) The group performs impairment tests to assess whether there has been a decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE. These are written down to their recoverable amount when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the

<<<

 asset. The recoverable amount from assets or cash-generating units is determined by calculating the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived

<<<

 from an asset or cash-generating unit. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates. See Note 4 for further information.
c) Annual assessment of the remaining economic life of PPE
The group conducts annual reviews of the remaining

<<<

 economic life of PPE. An increase or decrease in the remaining economic life will have an impact on future depreciation, as well as affect the cash flow horizon for calculating value in use. Economic life is estimated by considering the expected

<<<

 usage, physical wear and tear, as well as technical and commercial development. Assessment of future developments in demand in the markets Norske Skog's products are sold is central to the assessment of the economic life of the group's mills

<<<

. Expected future demand, together with the competitiveness of Norske Skog's mills, is crucial for the determination of economic life. In addition, legal or other restrictions relating to usage could affect the economic life of the mills in

<<<

 the group.
d) Provision for future environmental obligations The group's provision for future environmental obligations is based on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment. Changes in any of these assumptions could have

<<<

 an impact on the group's provision and group costs. See Note 20 for further information.
e) Residual value and dismantling provision The residual value of the group's production equipment is valued as the anticipated realisable value on the

<<<

 balance sheet date, after deducting the estimated costs relating to asset dismantling, removal and restoration. If the estimated costs exceed the estimated residual values, the net liability is added to the fixed asset cost in the balance sheet

<<<

 and a provision is recognised as a liability. The group performs a review of the residual value of its production equipment at the end of each accounting year. Residual value is affected by short-term changes in the underlying assumptions,

<<<

 for example scrap metal prices. A change in the residual value could have an impact on future depreciation costs. The provision for dismantling costs is based on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment. See Note 20 for

<<<

 further information.
F-37

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
f) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments

<<<

 that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date

<<<

. See Note 9 for more information.
g) Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the tax assets will be realised. Significant judgment is required to determine the amount that can be recognised

<<<

. The recognised amount depends foremost on the expected timing and level of future taxable profits. The judgments relate primarily to tax losses carried forward in Norske Skog's Norwegian operations. When an entity has a history of recent losses

<<<

, the deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses is recognised only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable profit will be generated. Estimated future taxable profit is not considered as convincing

<<<

 evidence unless the entity demonstrates the ability of generating significant taxable profit in the near future accounting periods or there are certain other events providing sufficient evidence of future taxable profit. The recognition of

<<<

 deferred tax assets is based on a number of assumptions based on management's best judgments. See Note 17 for further information.
h) Pensions
The present value of the pension obligation depends on several input factors that are determined

<<<

 by means of a number of actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the net pension expense (income) include the discount rate and salary adjustment. Changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying value of the pension

<<<

 obligation. See Note 13 for further information.
3. OPERATING SEGMENTS
Reportable segments
Norske Skog is a producer of publication paper. Publication paper includes newsprint and magazine paper. Newsprint encompasses standard newsprint and

<<<

 other paper qualities used in newspapers, inserts, catalogues, etc. These paper qualities, measured in grammes per square meter, will normally be in the range 40-57 g/m2. Magazine paper encompasses the paper qualities super calendered (SC)

<<<

, machine finished coated (MFC) and light weight coated (LWC). These paper qualities are used in magazines, periodicals, catalogues and brochures.
At the end of 2014, Norske Skog had nine fully or partly owned paper mills in seven countries

<<<

. Two of the mills produce only magazine paper, one produces both magazine paper and newsprint and six mills produce newsprint only.
The composition of Norske Skog's operating segments was changed with effect from 1 January 2014. The activities

<<<

 of the Norske Skog group are now focused on two business systems, namely Europe and Australasia. The segment structure is in line with how the group is managed internally. Norske Skog's chief operating decision maker is corporate management

<<<

, who distribute resources and assess performance of the group's operating segments. According to the operating model, all mills have a direct reporting line to corporate management. The mills have been aggregated into two operating segments

<<<

, publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia, based on geographical location. Norske Skog has an integrated strategy in Europe and Australasia to maximize the profit in each region. The optimisation is carried out through coordinated

<<<

 sales- and operational planning. The regional planning, in combination with structured sales and operational processes, ensures maximisation of profit.
The comparative figures for 2013 have been restated in accordance with the new segment structure

<<<

.

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. OPERATING SEGMENTS (Continued)
Publication paper Europe
The publication paper Europe segment encompasses production and sale of newsprint and magazine

<<<

 paper in Europe. All the five European mills and the regional sales organization are included in the operating segment publication paper Europe.

Publication paper Australasia
The publication paper Australasia segment encompasses production

<<<

 and sale of newsprint and magazine paper in Australasia. All the three mills in Australasia and the regional sales organization are included in the operating segment publication paper Australasia.

Other activities
Activities in the group that

<<<

 do not fall into the operating segments publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia are presented under other activities. This includes corporate functions, real estate activities, energy (commodity contracts and embedded derivatives

<<<

 in commodity contracts) and other holding company activities.

Revenues and expenses not allocated to operating segments
Norske Skog manages non-current debt, taxes and cash positions on a group basis. Consequently, financial items and tax

<<<

 expenses are presented only for the group as a whole.
The group's investment in associated companies accounted for in accordance with the equity method is primarily related to its 33.7% share in Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd., which

<<<

 is described in more detail in Note 19 Investments in associated companies.

Major customers
Norske Skog had a total sales volume of newsprint and magazine paper of 2 616 000 tonnes in 2014, of which sales to the group's largest customer constituted

<<<

 approximately 300 000 tonnes. Total sales volume in 2014 of newsprint and magazine paper to the five largest customers in Europe and Australasia amounted to approximately 300 000 and 390 000 tonnes respectively.

 unit publication paper Australasia consists of Norske Skog Albury (Australia), Norske Skog Boyer (Australia) and Norske Skog Tasman (New Zealand). Each of the two cash-generating units consists of several mills that together are creating a

<<<

 business system. Production can be moved between the mills, based on what gives best profitability for the group as a whole.
Cash flow is calculated individually for each business unit, based on the estimated useful life. The paper industry

<<<

 is a capital-intensive industry where investment decisions are made based on projects with a long time horizon. The production machines have a long technical life, while useful lives are linked to industry cost curves and the size of the market

<<<

. The estimated remaining useful life of the individual paper machines forms the basis for determining the length of the cash flow period. Estimated useful life for the individual paper machines in the group varies from two to 20 years. For

<<<

 the majority of the paper machines, including those with the highest carrying value, the expected useful life varies from 12 to 20 years. Technical and commercial obsolescence are the main input factors when expected usage of the different

<<<

 paper machines are assessed. Sales volumes develop in accordance with the useful lives of the different paper machines in the group.
Nominal cash flow is estimated in the currency in which it will be generated. The value is calculated by discounting

<<<

 based on a required rate of return on capital that is relevant for the cash-generating unit or the individual asset. The required rate of return is based on the interest rate on ten-year government bonds in the currency of the cash flow estimate

<<<

, an industry debt yield premium, industry beta and an equity risk premium. A country-specific risk premium relevant to the cash-generating unit or individual asset is also included in the required rate of return on capital.
When calculating

<<<

 value in use at the end of 2014, the discount rate after tax was in the interval from 6.2% to 8.9% (6.1% to 8.1% in 2013). The applied discount rate after tax for publication paper Europe was in the interval from 6.2% to 7.5% and publication

<<<

 paper Australasia was in the interval from 8.4% to 8.9%. The discount rate before tax for publication paper Europe was in in the interval from 9.2% to 10.3% and publication paper Australasia was in the interval from 12% to 12.4%. The main reason

<<<

 for differences in discount rate is due to country specific interest rate levels.

)
Different conceptual industry scenarios is considered in the impairment testing. By interpolation between the different conceptual scenarios, all possible outcomes are implicitly considered. The different scenarios are weighted by an estimated

<<<

 probability assigned to each outcome. The impairment testing at 31 December 2014 was based on the operating plan for the group for 2015 as approved by the board of directors.

Sensitivity to estimates of recoverable amount
The estimation of

<<<

 recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty

<<<

 when it comes to the outcome of these calculations. Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations would influence recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made in the

<<<

 calculation of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate used. Assuming that the current profit level remains for the key assets

<<<

, there will be no impairment. A reduction in sales price and sales volumes for the whole group in the cash flow period of 5% will cause a reduction in recoverable amount in the order of NOK 3 200 million and NOK 1 300 million respectively.

<<<

 Correspondingly, a 1% increase in the discount rate will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 700 million. An appreciation of NOK of 1% against all other functional currencies in the Norske Skog group will cause a reduction in

<<<

 the recoverable amount of NOK 200 million.

Expected useful life
Norske Skog has conducted sensitivity analyses with respect to changes in expected useful life of the group's paper machines. If the expected useful life of all the group's paper machines is reduced by

<<<

 one year, the annual depreciation charge will increase by around NOK 70 million.
In connection with the year-end closing process for 2014, Norske Skog performed a review of the expected remaining useful lives of PPE. The expected useful life

<<<

 for the converted Paper Machine 2 at Norske Skog Boyer has been extended with effect from 1 January 2015, as the machine last year was converted to Magazine paper from Newsprint. In addition, a minor extension in the useful life of Paper Machine

<<<

 10 at Norske Skog Walsum has been made. No other changes in useful life will be made in 2015 compared to those applied in 2014. Because the level of depreciation in 2014 by far exceeded purchases of PPE and the mentioned extensions in useful

<<<

 life from 1 January 2015, the future annual depreciation amount is expected to decrease.

8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
Norske Skog is exposed to various financial risk factors through the group's operating activities, including market risk 

<<<

(interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. Norske Skog seeks to minimise losses and volatility on the group's earnings caused by adverse market movements. Moreover, Norske Skog monitors and manages

<<<

 financial risk based on internal policies and standards set forth by corporate management and approved by the board of directors. These written policies provide principles for the overall risk management as well as standards for managing currency

risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and the use of financial derivatives and

 non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and standards is continuously monitored. There were no breaches of these policies during 2014 or 2013.

Market Risk
a) Interest rate risk
The goal of interest rate risk management

<<<

 is to secure the lowest possible interest rate payments over time within acceptable risk limits. In the current challenging situation in the publication paper market, Norske Skog has secured most of the interest rate payments by primarily paying

 fixed interest rates on its loan obligations.

All amounts presented in the table are notional amounts. Total interest-bearing liabilities will therefore differ

<<<

 from booked amounts due to bond discounts/premiums, hedge reserve, and unrealised effects from fair value hedging (see Note 11 Interest-bearing liabilities). Floating rate exposure is calculated without accounting for potential future refinancing

<<<

.

In te re s t rate s e n s itiv ity analysis
In accordance with IFRS 7 F in a n c ia l in s tru m e n ts --d is c lo s u re s , an interest rate sensitivity analysis is presented showing the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest

<<<

 costs and interest income, as well as equity where applicable. The analysis is based on the following assumptions:
 Floating rate debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates, i.e. the interest costs or interest income associated with

<<<

 such instruments will fluctuate based on changes in market rates. These changes are accounted for in the sensitivity analysis. The result is based on the assumption that all other factors are kept constant.
 Changes in market rates on fixed

<<<

 rate debt will only affect the income statement if they are measured at fair value. Thus, fixed rate instruments recognised at amortised cost will not represent an interest rate risk as defined by IFRS 7. Such instruments will therefore not

<<<

 have any influence on the sensitivity analysis.
 Changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives that are not designated as a fair value hedge of the group's liabilities, and which are subsequently measured at fair value through profit

<<<

 or loss, are taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis.
 Currency derivatives will only affect the sensitivity analysis to a very limited extent upon changes in the discount rate.
 Results are presented net of tax, using the Norwegian

<<<

 statutory tax rate of 27%.
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on a parallel shift in the yield curve for each relevant currency to which Norske Skog is exposed. Following a 50 basis point downward/upward parallel shift in the yield

<<<

 curve in all interest rate markets to which Norske Skog is exposed, net earnings would have been NOK 1 million higher/lower at 31 December 2014 (NOK 2 million lower/higher at 31 December 2013). Change in net interest payments accounts for n

<<<

 Ok 1million, and the total change in market values of derivatives carried at fair value through profit or loss accounts for NOK 0 million.

b) Currency risk
Transaction r is k - c a s h flo w h e d g e
The group has revenues and expenses in various currencies. The major currencies are NOK, EUR, USD, GBR AUD and NZD. Transaction risk arises

<<<

 because the group has a different currency split on income and expenses. Norske Skog calculates a 12-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling basis. The result of the hedging is included in Financial items in the income

<<<

 statement. Norske Skog does not use hedge accounting for the rolling cash flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a gain of NOK 2 million in 2014 (loss of NOK 66 million in 2013). Over time, currency losses or earnings are expected

<<<

 to offset increased or reduced future gross operating earnings. The cash flow hedge program was closed during 2014.

T ranslation ris k -- n e t in v e s tm e n t h e d g e
The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK. Currency

<<<

 translation risk arises when the financial statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies, are translated into NOK. In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition to traditional

<<<

 debt instruments, all combined currency and interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are also used for hedging net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Norske Skog's net investment hedging is carried out in accordance with IAS 39

<<<

. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity and offset by translation differences from assets in subsidiaries. The gain or loss related to the ineffective portion is immediately

<<<

 recognised in the income statement. There was no ineffectiveness related to net investment hedge in 2014 or 2013. The effective portion recognised in equity was a loss of NOK 151million in 2014 (loss of NOK 243 million in 2013). The portion

 of the debt portfolio to which hedge accounting does not apply, was somewhat smaller in 2014 than in 2013. The Foreign exchange gains and losses from such liabilities are recognised in the income statement under Financial items.
Cumulative

The following foreign exchange sensitivity analysis calculates the sensitivity of derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments

<<<

 on net profit and equity, based on a defined appreciation/ depreciation of NOK against relevant currencies, keeping all other variables constant. The analysis is based on several assumptions, including:
 Norske Skog as a group comprises entities

<<<

 with different functional currencies. Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments of a monetary nature, denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity, create foreign exchange rate exposure on the consolidated

<<<

 income statement. Moreover, foreign currency risk will also affect equity.

F-49

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING (Continued)
 Financial instruments

<<<

 denominated in the functional currency of the entity have no currency risk and will therefore not be applicable to this analysis. Furthermore, the foreign currency exposure of translating financial accounts of subsidiaries into the group's

<<<

 presentational currency is not part of this analysis.
 Sensitivity on commodity contracts and embedded derivatives is presented separately under ``Commodity risk''.
 Currency derivatives and foreign currency debt that are designated as net

<<<

 investment hedges and qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39 will only affect equity.
 Other currency derivatives that are recognised at fair value through profit and loss will affect the income statement. These effects come mainly

<<<

 from currency derivatives and financial liabilities managed as economic net investment hedges which do not qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39.
 Other non-derivative financial instruments accounted for in the analysis comprise

<<<

 cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accounts receivable and borrowings denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity.
 Correlation effects between currencies are not taken into account. Figures are

<<<

 presented net of tax.
At 31 December 2014, if NOK had appreciated 10% against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 369 million higher (NOK 265 million

<<<

 higher at 31 December 2013). If NOK had depreciated by 10% at 31 December 2014 against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 369 million lower (NOK 2

<<<

85 million lower at 31 December 2013). Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner in 2013 due to changes in the fair value of options. The effect of the sensitivity analysis on the income statement is mainly caused by changes in

<<<

 fair value of derivatives designated as rolling cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange gains/losses on the translation of EUR and USD denominated debt for which there is no hedge accounting. Because the portion of debt has increased in relation

<<<

 to the portion of cash, the effect on the income statement is higher in 2014 compared to 2013.
Given a 10% appreciation/depreciation of NOK, equity would have been NOK 133 million higher/lower (NOK 189 million higher/lower at 31 December 2

<<<

013) as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. The sensitivity analysis on equity excludes the effects from the sensitivity analysis on the income statement, calculated above.

<<<


c) Commodity risk
A major part of Norske Skog's global commodity demand is secured through long-term contracts. Norske Skog only uses financial instruments to a limited extent to hedge these contracts. The hedging ratio represents a trade-off

<<<

 between risk exposure and the opportunity to take advantage of short-term price drops in the spot market. Hedging levels are regulated through mandates approved by the board of directors.
Some of Norske Skog's purchase and sales contracts are

<<<

 defined as financial instruments, or contain embedded derivatives, which fall within the scope of IAS 39. These financial instruments and embedded derivatives are measured in the balance sheet at fair value with value changes recognised through

<<<

 profit or loss. Commodity contracts are either financial contracts for the purpose of trading or hedging, or physical commodity contracts that are not for the purpose of own use. The embedded derivatives are common in physical commodity contracts

<<<

 and comprise a wide variety of derivative characteristics.
Changes in fair value of commodity contracts reflect unrealised gains or losses and are calculated as the difference between market price and contract price, discounted to present value

<<<

. Some commodity contracts are bilateral contracts or embedded derivatives in bilateral contracts, for which there exists no active market. Therefore, valuation techniques are used as much as possible, with the use of available

market information. Techniques that reflect how the market could be expected to price instruments are used in

<<<

 non-observable markets.
Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists mainly of physical energy contracts. Fair value of commodity contracts is especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives

<<<

 in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations. The energy contracts in Norway are nominated in EUR. These contracts contain embedded derivatives that are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. NOK weakened against

<<<

 EUR during 2014, which had a negative effect on the fair value of the embedded derivatives.
In April 2013, Norske Skog Saugbrugs signed a new long-term energy contract for the supply of electricity for the paper mill in Halden. The new energy

<<<

 contract secures an annual supply of 1.0 TWh up to 31 December 2020. The agreement entered into force on 1 May 2013. The contract ensures almost full energy coverage for Norske Skog Saugbrugs over the contract period. During 2013, Norske Skogindustrier

) securing available financing through committed credit facilities. Managing liquidity risk is centralised on a group level. In order to uncover future liquidity risk, Norske Skog forecasts both short- and long-term cash flows. Cash flow forecasts

<<<

 include cash flows stemming from operations, investments, financing activities and financial instruments. The group had current investments, cash and cash equivalents of NOK 710 million at 31 December 2014 (NOK 1 015 million at 31 December

<<<

 2013). None credit facility at 31 December 2014 (undrawn credit facility of NOK 250 million at 31 December 2013). See Note 11 for more information regarding the maturity of facilities. Restricted bank deposits amounted to NOK 322 million at

<<<

 31 December 2014 (NOK 258 million at 31 December 2013). The board of directors recognises the challenging markets that Norske Skog operates in with price and currency uncertainty. The board of directors will thus have a continuous focus on

<<<

 cash generation through 2015 to ensure sufficient liquidity for both debt maturities and the operations of Norske Skog. The ongoing initiatives to improve cash flow from operations and the significantly enhanced liquidity position of the group

<<<

 following the refinancing, should in the opinion of the board of directors provide prudent cash balances during 2015.Despite this leverage remains high and requires improved profitability, but the refinancing enables the group to focus on improving

<<<

 operations, cost initiatives and capital efficiency. In February 2015, Norske Skog completed the refinancing of a portion of its bond maturities. See Note 27 for further information. The following table shows the contractual maturities of non

<<<

-derivative financial liabilities and other derivative financial instruments. All amounts disclosed in the table are undiscounted cash flows. Furthermore, amounts denominated in foreign currency are translated to NOK using closing rates at 

<<<

31 December. These amounts consist of trade payables, interest payments and principal payments on derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Variable rate interest cash flows are calculated using the forward yield curve. Projected

<<<

 interest payments are based on the maturity schedule at 31 December without accounting for forecasted refinancing and/or other changes in the liability portfolio. All other cash flows are based on the group's positions held at 31 December

 ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING (Continued)
Credit risk
Norske Skog makes a credit evaluation of all financial trading counterparties. Based on the evaluation, a limit on

<<<

 credit exposure is established for each counterparty. These limits are monitored continuously in relation to unrealised profit on financial instruments and placements. The maximum credit risk arising from financial instruments is represented

<<<

 by the carrying amount of financial assets in the balance sheet. This includes derivatives with positive market value except for embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives are not subjected to credit risk, as there are no future cash flows

<<<

 associated with such derivatives.
Norske Skog trades with a group of large Nordic and international banks which are publicly rated in the interval from A A - to A - . The credit risk on deposits and derivative transactions is spread across

<<<

 these banks.
Norske Skog's procedures for credit management of European trade receivables, and the authority to approve credit lines to customers of European business units, are regulated by a policy drafted and maintained by a centralised

<<<

 credit management function at the head office. The operational responsibility to act within the guidelines as set out by this policy lies with each business unit. For operations outside of Europe, customer credit management is handled locally

<<<

.

9. DERIVATIVES
Fair value of derivatives
The table below classifies financial instruments measured in the balance sheet at fair value, by valuation method. The different valuation methods are described as levels and are defined as follows

<<<

:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or

<<<

 indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consist mainly of physical energy contracts. The commodity contracts classified as financial contracts

<<<

 are mainly related to energy contracts in Australia and New Zealand. Embedded derivatives are mainly related to energy contracts in Norway. Fair value of commodity contracts is sensitive to estimates of future energy prices. Fair value of embedded

<<<

 derivatives is sensitive to estimates of currency exchange rates and price indices.

The fair value of derivatives that are not traded in an active market (over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using various valuation techniques. Interest

<<<

 rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forward rate agreements and foreign currency forward contracts are all valued by estimating the present value of future cash flows. Currency options are valued using recognised option pricing models. Quoted

<<<

 cash and swap rates are used as input for calculating zero coupon curves used for discounting. The exchange rates used are the quoted closing rates at 31 December.

The fair value of commodity contracts recognised in the balance sheet is calculated

<<<

 by using quotes from actively traded markets when available. Otherwise, price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used. Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 are recognised in the balance

<<<

 sheet and valued on the same principle as financial contracts. Some of these are long-term energy contracts. In calculating the fair value of embedded derivatives, valuation techniques are used in the absence of observable market inputs. Embedded

<<<

 currency options are calculated using a Black 76 valuation model, where some input assumptions have been made in absence of an active long-term option market.

Fair value includes the impact of credit risk and the adjustment for credit risk

<<<

 is dependent on whether the derivative is in the money (asset) or out of the money (liability). Credit value adjustment is applied to assets positions based on credit risk associated with the counter-party. Debit value adjustment is (from 

<<<

2014) applied to liability positions, based on Norske Skog's own credit risk.

The electricity prices for long-term electricity contracts in New Zealand are not directly observable in the market for the whole contract length. A change in the forecast to a reasonably possible alternative would change

 the fair value. For the energy contracts in New Zealand, a reasonably possible alternative at 31 December 2014 would be a downwards parallel shift of the long end of the forward curve of 2% (downwards shift of 2% in 2013).

 (CEO) Sven Ombudstvedt at 31 December 2014 was NOK 4 360 000. Total salary and other benefits received by Ombudstvedt in 2014 amounted to NOK 6 554 313 (NOK 5 483 715 in 2013).

The CEO's retirement age is 64. Early retirement benefits and

<<<

 salary over 12 G (base amount in the Norwegian national insurance scheme) are covered by a supplementary agreement for corporate management. The CEO entered the company's defined contribution pension plan from 1 January 2011.

The mutual period

<<<

 of notice for the CEO is six months. If circumstances arise in which the company and the CEO, by mutual agreement, terminate the contract of employment in the best interests of the company, the CEO is entitled to severance pay equivalent to

<<<

 payment of base salary for 18 months after the end of the notice period. The amount receivable by other members of corporate management under the same circumstances is severance pay equivalent to payment of base salary for nine months.

The

<<<

 annual bonus agreements for the CEO and other members of corporate management specify a maximum payment of 50% of base salary. The basis for calculating this bonus is set annually by the board and CEO. No members of corporate management have

<<<

 been given loans or granted securities or guarantees from the employer.

The total remuneration to members of the board in 2014 was NOK 4 038 098 (NOK 4 513 660 in 2013), including remuneration to members of the audit, election- and remuneration

 incentive program issued in total 3 780 000 synthetic options. At the start of the program, (award date 17 July 2014) 2 250 000 synthetic options were awarded, leaving 1 530 000 synthetic options to be granted later. Each option carries the

<<<

 right to be paid an amount in cash equal to (a) the fair market value less (b) the exercise price, including any hurdle rate added to the exercise price as of the exercise date. Fair market value is the volume weighted average trading price

<<<

 of the shares on Oslo Stock Exchange over a period of five trading days starting on the exercise date. The exercise date is the latter of the date falling three years after the award date or the date of publication of the company's interim

<<<

 financial statements for the first six months of 2017. The initial exercise price (strike price) for the synthetic options was NOK 4.80. The exercise price shall be increased by 10 per cent pro anno (the hurdle rate). The hurdle rate shall

 be added to the exercise price annually in arrears as of each anniversary of the award date, and shall from then be included in the basis for the calculation of further hurdle rate.
The ultimate cost of a cash-settled share-based transaction

 is the actual cash paid to the counterparty, which will be the fair value at settlement date. The periodic determination of this liability is at each reporting date between grant and settlement the fair value of the award. The fair value of

 the award is determined in accordance with the specific requirements in IFRS 2. During the vesting period, the liability recognised at each reporting date is the fair value of the award at that date multiplied by the expired

The defined benefit schemes in Norway cover people between 56 and 67 years of age, who were employed before 1 January 2011. The defined benefit

<<<

 obligations in Norway only encompass active members (a small number of people in early retirement until the end of 2015), since they leave the defined benefit scheme (having a paid-up policy) when they retire.

Plan assets of the pension schemes

<<<

 in Norske Skogindustrier ASA, Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS and Norske Skog Skogn AS are managed by a life insurance company and invested in accordance with the general guidelines governing investments by life insurance companies in Norway. With

<<<

 effect from the beginning of 2011, a new defined contribution scheme was introduced in Norway, with a contribution of 4% for earnings between 1 and 6 G and 8% between 6 and 12 G. The defined benefit plan was closed and now only covers employees

<<<

 born before 1 January 1959 who were employed before the closure.

When evaluating plan assets, their estimated value at 31 December is used. This estimated value is corrected every year in accordance with the figures for the market value of

<<<

 the assets provided by the insurance company.

Expected return on plan assets is based on historical return and the investment profile of the plan assets.

When measuring incurred obligations, the estimated obligation at 31 December is used

<<<

. This estimated obligation is corrected every year in accordance with the figures for incurred pension obligations provided by the actuary.

In addition to the benefit obligation funded through insurance plans, the group has unfunded benefit

<<<

 obligations, of which Norske Skog Walsum GmbH is the largest. The defined benefit scheme at Norske Skog Walsum GmbH was curtailed at the level it had at 31 December 2010, meaning there is no increase in the obligation as a result of salary

<<<

 increases or the time worked for the company after this date. The majority of employees covered by the defined benefit scheme at Norske Skog Walsum are in their late fifties and sixties. Number of retired people is 183. The unfunded obligations

<<<

 also include estimated future obligations relating to the former Norwegian early retirement scheme, pensions to former owners of subsidiaries as well as pensions for senior management and directors. Obligations relating to senior management

<<<

 pensions are partly funded through a supplementary retirement plan with a life insurance company.

In addition to defined benefit plans, there are also various defined contribution plans.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses for the most important assumptions related to defined benefit schemes to predict how fluctuations will impact pension liabilities

<<<

 in the consolidated balance sheet. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of pension obligations the amount is most sensitive to changes in discount rate, salary adjustment and pension growth rate. The sensitivity of the pension

<<<

 obligation is shown in the table below:

SENSITIVITY
Discount rate- 0 . 5 % ........................................................................................... Salary adjustment-0 .5 % ..............................................

................................... Future national security - 1 .0 % .......................................................................... Future pension- 1 .0 % ........................................................................

<<<

.................

INCREASE
-6 9 -1 2 - 42 N/A

DECREASE
67 11 11 N/A

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in

<<<

 some of the assumptions may be correlated.

The net loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment in 2013 of NOK 178 million was primarily related to the divestments of Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in

<<<

 Brazil and Norske Skog (Thailand) Co. Ltd. in Thailand.
On 14 June 2013, Norske Skog signed an agreement for the sale of 51% of its shares in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil. The transaction was completed on 27 June 2013. The total loss of

<<<

 NOK218 million on the divestment consisted of NOK 95 million relating to the divestment of 51% of the shares, and NOK 123 million relating to the remaining 49% stake which was recognised in the balance sheet as an associated company in line

<<<

 with the equity method of accounting at 31 December 2013. The loss on the remaining 49% stake consisted of the difference between the book value of the net assets derecognised and the fair value of the investment in associated company. See

<<<

 Note 19 Investments in associated companies for more information. The loss on the divested 51% stake included NOK 12 million relating to currency translation differences and net investment hedge that were recognised directly in equity during

<<<

 the ownership period and reclassified to Other gains and losses upon loss of control.
On 5 October 2013, Norske Skog signed an agreement for the sale of its shares in the company that owns and operates the mill at Singburi in Thailand, Norske

<<<

 Skog (Thailand) Co. Ltd. The transaction was completed on 21 November 2013. Norske Skog Singburi was deconsolidated from this date and a gain of NOK 49 million was recognised. This amount included a gain of NOK 35 million related to currency

<<<

 translation differences that were recognised directly in equity during the ownership period and reclassified to Other gains and losses upon divestment.
The net loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment also included

<<<

 a loss of NOK 26 million in relation to input VAT on transaction costs incurred upon the divestments of mills in South Korea and China in previous years. The Norwegian VAT authorities claim that this amount is not deductible. However, Norske

<<<

 Skog does not agree with this claim and expects to take out legal proceedings. Norske Skog has no outstanding payments to the VAT authorities in relation to this amount and has expensed the full amount in 2013, due to uncertainty regarding

<<<

 the outcome of this case. The remaining amount included in the net loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment included a gain of NOK 23 million on divestments of non production related property.
Norske Skog's

<<<

 portfolio of commodity contracts consists mainly of physical energy contracts. The fair value of commodity contracts is especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts is

<<<

 influenced by currency and price index fluctuations. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on profit after tax of fluctuations in energy prices, currency and price indices is given in Note 8. The valuation techniques used are described in Note

<<<

 9. The gain on commodity contracts in 2014 were due to negative change in Producer price index in New Zealand. In 2013 the losses were due to lower expected future energy prices.
Other realised gains and losses of NOK 13 million in 2014 were

<<<

 primarily related financial hedging of energy and sale of emission rights. Other realised gains and losses of n Ok -1 0 2 million in 2013 were primarily related to the termination of the long-term group agreement from 1998 that applied to the

Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd. (MNI)
The company is incorporated in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

<<<

, and is a producer of newsprint. The carrying value of Norske Skog's investment in MNI was NOK 410 million at 31 December 2014, which corresponds to Norske Skog's share (33.7%) of the equity in MNI's company financial statements. Based on the

<<<

 company's financial statements, operating revenue in 2014 was NOK 837 million (NOK 946 million in 2013) and net profit was NOK 43 million (NOK 77 million in 2013). Total assets amounted to NOK 1 725 million at 31 December 2014 (NOK 1 579 million

 at 31 December 2013) and total liabilities were NOK 463 million at 31 December 2014 (NOK 765 million at 31 December 2013).

Norske Skog Pisa Ltda.
On 14 June 2013, Norske Skog signed an agreement for the sale of 51% of its shares in Norske

<<<

 Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil. The transaction was completed with effect from 27 June 2013. Following the transaction, Norske Skog was no longer the controlling owner of the mill, and Norske Skog Pisa was therefore deconsolidated from 27 June 

<<<

2013. At the time of the initial divestment, Norske Skog had also agreed upon the terms of sale for the remaining 49% of its shares in Norske Skog Pisa. In January 2014, Norske Skog renegotiated the terms of the sale of the remaining stake,

<<<

 with an accelerated timeline, and a sales price of USD 37 million. The value of the investment in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. at the end of December 2013 reflected the agreed sales price of USD 37 million (NOK 223 million). The sales proceeds was

Restructuring

<<<

 provision
The restructuring provision on NOK 17 million at 31 December 2014 is classified in the balance sheet line item Other current liabilities. The provision includes various restructuring activities included provision for severance payments

<<<

 and other costs at Norske Skog Bruck (NOK 5 million), Norske Skog Walsum (NOK 2 million) and Norske Skog Skogn (NOK 8 million).
The amount expensed in 2014 in relation to restructuring activities amounted to NOK 4 million. This relates mainly

<<<

 to the restructuring activities listed above. Total payments relating to restructuring activities in 2014 amounted to NOK 153 million. This relates mainly to the closure of PM4 at Norske Skog Walsum (NOK 127 million) and head office (NOK 1

<<<

2 million),
The restructuring provision at 31 December 2013 was NOK 166 million. NOK 138 million of this provision related to severance payments and other costs at Norske Skog Walsum, where it was decided during 2013 to permanently stop production

<<<

 at one paper machine (PM4). The machine ceased paper production in December 2013. Various other restructuring activities included provisions for severance payments and other costs of NOK 13 million as a result of the ongoing downsizing at head

<<<

 office and changes in corporate management, NOK 7 million at Norske Skog Bruck, and NOK 5 million at Norske Skog Boyer.
The amount expensed in 2013 in relation to restructuring activities amounted to NOK 145 million. This amount related mainly

<<<

 to the provisions listed above, offset by the recognition of NOK 10 million income due to the release of provisions expensed in 2012 at Norske Skog Tasman (NOK 6 million), Norske Skog Golbey (NOK 3 million) and Norske Skog Skogn (NOK 1 million

<<<

). Total cash flow relating to restructuring activities in 2013 amounted to NOK 122 million, and related mainly to Norske Skog Tasman (NOK 77 million), Norske Skog Walsum (NOK 20 million) and head office (NOK 13 million).
Dismantling provision

<<<


Provisions related to future dismantling costs arising from a future closing down of production facilities amounted to NOK 65 million at 31 December 2014, compared to NOK 56 million at 31 December 2013. The total amount is classified as non

<<<

-current and will only be realised at the time of a future shut down of any of the Norske Skog production units. The provision is the net present value of the future estimated costs, calculated using a long-term risk-free interest rate. The

<<<

 periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement line Financial items. The opposite entry for dismantling provision and change in provision estimates is Property, plant and equipment.
Discount rates and assumptions included

<<<

 as part of the best estimate will impact the future carrying value of the dismantling provision. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction in the future discount rate of one percentage point would increase the provision by approximately NOK

<<<

 9 million, with a corresponding increase in future depreciation on property, plant and equipment.
Environmental provision
The group's provision for environmental obligations is presented in the balance sheet as Other non-current liabilities

<<<

. The provision is related to estimated future costs for cleaning up any environmental pollution caused by Norske Skog production units. The provision will mainly be realised in a future period upon a potential shut down of the production activities

<<<

 of any of the Norske Skog production units. Increased environmental requirements from local governments may also lead to realisation of this provision at an earlier point in time.
Provisions for future environmental obligations amounted to

<<<

 NOK 211 million at 31 December 2014 compared to NOK 193 million at 31 December 2013. The increase is due to currency translation effects and lower discount rates. Resources spent on environmental activities during 2014 amounted to NOK 4 million

<<<

20. PROVISIONS (Continued)
The carrying value of the provision is the best estimate made by measuring the expected value of the specific obligations

<<<

, discounted to present value using a long-term risk-free interest rate when the time value of money is material. Changes in factors included in the expected value will impact the carrying value of the obligation. To illustrate the sensitivity

<<<

, a reduction in the future discount rate by one percentage point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 24 million. Changes in accounting estimates not related to assets are classified as operating items in the income statement,

 and the periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised within the income statement line Financial items.

24. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Norske Skog's objective when managing capital is to maximise return on equity within the limits set by the group's external debt financing.
In order to improve the capital

<<<

 structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
See Note 8 for further information on the debt maturity and Note 27 for further information

<<<

 on the refinancing of bonds after the balance sheet date.

25. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Norske Skog is an international company that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and

<<<

 contracting parties as well as assessments from public authorities in each country it operates.
Norske Skog has continued the process related to simplification of the group's corporate structure in 2014. The simplification of the group's corporate

<<<

 structure in combination with changes in individual countries' tax laws could increase the group's tax exposure. However, due to completed reorganisations and tax assessments, the overall tax exposure has decreased during the last years.

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
26. RELATED PARTIES
All transactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with the arm's length principle.
Some of Norske Skogindustrier ASA

<<<

's shareholders are forest owners delivering forestry products to the group's production units in Norway. One of the board members, Eilif Due, is a forest owner who supplies wood to the group on normal commercial terms. All contracts for supply

<<<

 of wood are entered into through forest owner associations or companies.
In 2013, Norske Skog entered into a contract with Fram Eiendom (Fram Realinvest AS, Sjlyststranda Nring AS, Fram Eiendomsdrift AS and Skyen Nringsbygg a S) for the

<<<

 lease of its head office at Skyen. Torstein I. Tvenge, together with close family members, controls 100% of Fram Eiendom. Tvenge is also a shareholder of Norske Skogindustrier ASA. The lease contract for the head office has been entered into

<<<

 on normal commercial terms. Lease payments to Fram Eiendom recognised as an expense in 2014 amounted to NOK 4.1 million.
Purchases of goods and services by associated company Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd. (MNI) from other companies

<<<

 in the Norske Skog group during 2014 amounted to NOK 0 million (NOK 10 million in 2013). There were no amounts payable by MNI to the Norske Skog group at 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013.
None of the board members receives remuneration

<<<

 for their work for the company from any source other than the company itself.
27. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
On 22 January 2015, Norske Skog launched two separate offers (i) an offering of EUR 290 million (EUR 179 million) Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes (SSN) due December 2019 to achieve a broader refinancing and debt extension of the group's capital structure and (ii) an exchange offer of existing notes.
On 24 February 2015, Norske Skog completed the refinancing of a portion of its

<<<

 bond maturities through the issuance of EUR 290 million senior secured notes (SSN) and the exchange of existing bonds into new bonds with longer maturities. Norske Skog has extended the maturities on a significant portion of its indebtedness

<<<

, with new notes maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2023. The new EUR 290 million s Sn mature in December 2019 and will be structurally senior to all remaining existing notes and notes issued in the exchange offer. The SSN is secured by among other

<<<

 things share pledge in operating subsidiaries, new intermediate holding companies, and in addition asset pledge in the Australasian business. The terms of the SSN include customary default and cross default terms, and the pool of security can

<<<

 be enforced upon in a continuing default scenario under the SSNs. The exchange notes will be structurally junior to the SSN, but structurally senior to remaining existing notes and mature in 2021 and 2023. The remaining existing notes will

<<<

 be structurally junior to the SSN and exchange notes.
More than 75% of the existing bond holders consented to the transactions, and approximately 45% of the existing bonds participated in the exchange offer. Immediate de-leveraging of around

<<<

A u d it o r 's r e s p o n s ib ilit y
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing

 standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether

 the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment

, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair

 presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes

<<<

 evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Norske Skogindustrier

<<<

 ASA (``the company'') and its subsidiaries (``the group'') manufacture, distribute and sell publication paper. This includes newsprint and magazine paper.
Norske Skog's segment structure has been changed with effect from 1 January 2014. See

<<<

 Note 6 Operating segments for more information.
All amounts in the interim financial statements are presented in NOK million unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding, there may be differences in the summation of columns and rows.
The interim

<<<

 financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors in Norske Skogindustrier ASA on 22 October 2014.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The interim financial statements of Norske Skog have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 In

<<<

 te rim F in a n c ia l R e p o rtin g . The interim financial statements do not include all information required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for 2013. The

<<<

 interim financial statements are unaudited.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements for the year ended 3

<<<

1 December 2013, except for the adaptation of amended standards and new interpretations, which are mandatory from 1 January 2014. These changes are described in the annual financial statements for 2013.
The group has not early adopted any standard

<<<

, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet mandatory.
3. ESTIMATES, JUDGEMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
Preparation of interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS implies use of estimates, which are based on judgements

<<<

 and assumptions that affect the application of accounting principles and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual amounts might differ from such estimates.

Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life and goodwill are not subject to amortisation, but are tested annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment, and

<<<

 intangible assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value

<<<

 less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) model for calculating the

<<<

 present value of future cash flows. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates.
There was no indication that further impairments or reversals of previous impairments should be made at 30 September 2014.

See Note 9 in the annual financial statements for 2013 for more information regarding the calculation

 of fair value of derivatives.

P ro visio ns
Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of

<<<

 past events; an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for future environmental and dismantling liabilities are based on a number of assumptions

 made using management's best judgment.
See Note 2 in the annual financial statements for 2013 for a more thorough description of important accounting estimates and assumptions impacting the preparation of financial statements.

Norske Skog is an international company that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and contracting parties.
Norske Skog has an ongoing process related

 to simplification of the group's corporate structure. This, in combination with changes in individual countries' tax laws, could increase the group's tax exposure.

5. DIVESTMENT OF OPERATIONS
In January 2014, the terms of sale for Norske Skog's remaining 49% stake in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil were renegotiated, with an accelerated timeline

<<<

 and a sales price of USD 37 million. The transaction was completed on 17 January. Following this, Norske Skog has no remaining interests in South America, and the investment in associated company in Pisa (NOK 223 million at the end of 2013

<<<

) has been derecognised from the balance sheet. The value at the end of 2013 reflected the agreed sales price, so the transaction did not result in any additional income statement impact in 2014. The sales proceeds from the transaction was received

<<<

 during the second quarter of 2014.
Norske Skog's share in the sales offices Norske Skog Czech & Slovak Republic spol.s r.o (Czech Republic) and Norske Skog Polska Sp.z o.o. (Poland) were sold in June 2014.

Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists primarily of physical energy contracts. The fair value

<<<

 of commodity contracts is particularly sensitive to future fluctuations in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations.

Higher energy prices have a positive impact

<<<

 on fair value. Energy prices in New Zealand are virtually unchanged compared with the previous quarter.

The energy contracts in Norway are nominated in EUR. These contracts contain embedded derivatives that are recognised at fair value in

<<<

 accordance with IAS 39 F in a n c ia l in s tru m e n ts -- re c o g n itio n a n d m e a s u re m e n t. NOK has strengthened against EUR during the quarter, which has had a positive effect on the fair value of the embedded derivatives.

A

<<<

 decrease in estimates of consumer price indices has a positive impact on fair value. Consumer price indices, which affect the fair value, show only small changes compared with the previous quarter.

Changes in the value of energy-/commodity

<<<

 contracts and embedded derivatives in contracts are presented in the income statement line Other gains and losses. Realised effects from financial energy contracts are also included in this accounting line.

Gains and losses on level 3 financial

<<<

 instruments recognised in the income statement, line item Other gains and losses, amounted to NOK 96 million in the third quarter (NOK - 2 7 million in the second quarter).

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Norske Skogindustrier

<<<

 ASA (``the company'') and its subsidiaries (together ``the group'') manufacture, distribute and sell publication paper. This includes newsprint and magazine paper. The group has nine fully and partly owned mills in seven countries.
Norske Skogindustrier

<<<

 ASA is incorporated in Norway and has its head office at Skyen outside of Oslo. The company is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors in Norske Skogindustrier

<<<

 ASA on 26 February 2014.
All amounts are presented in NOK million unless otherwise stated. There may be some small differences in the summation of columns due to rounding.
The annual financial statements are presented in English only.
Adoption

<<<

 of the amended IAS 19-- restatement of 2012 figures
Norske Skog implemented the amended accounting standard IAS 19 E m p lo y e e b e n e fits from 1 January 2013, with full retrospective application. Comparative figures for 2012 have been

<<<

 restated in accordance with the amended standard. Since the amendment has been applied retrospectively, the consolidated balance sheet at 1 January 2012 has been included in the consolidated financial statements. The implementation effects

<<<

 of the amended standard are further described in Note 13.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Norske Skogindustrier ASA are set out below. The policies

<<<

 have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations from the IFRS Interpretations

<<<

 Committee (IFRIC), as adopted by the European Union (EU). They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of biological assets, available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value

<<<

 through profit or loss.
Consolidation
a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights

<<<

.
The group also assesses whether control exists where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power, but is able to govern the financial and operating policies by virtue of de-facto control. Important factors when assessing de-facto control

<<<

 are whether or not the group can choose the board of directors and whether the group's voting rights give the group the power to govern the financial and operating policies etc.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date at which control

<<<

 is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from the date on which such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting

<<<

 from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been amended where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
b) Change in ownership

<<<

 interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Upon further acquisition of shares in subsidiaries from non-controlling

<<<

 interests, the difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the
F-100

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued

<<<

) carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary, is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
c) Disposal of subsidiaries When the group ceases to have control, any retained interest

<<<

 in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for

<<<

 the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related

<<<

 assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
d) Associates Associates are all entities over which the group exercises significant

<<<

 influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% to 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The investment is initially recognised at cost, and the

<<<

 carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The group's share of post acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as Share

<<<

 of profit in associated companies and is assigned to the carrying value of the investment, together with the group's share of other comprehensive income in the associated company. When the group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds

<<<

 its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Profits and losses resulting from transactions

<<<

 between the group and its associates are recognised in the consolidated financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the associates. At each reporting date, the group determines whether there is any objective

<<<

 evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognises the amount

<<<

 as Share of profit in associated companies. Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only

<<<

 a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
Segment reporting Reportable segments The activities in the group are divided into two operating segments

<<<

: newsprint and magazine paper. The newsprint segment is further segregated into two geographical regions, newsprint Europe and newsprint outside of Europe. The segment structure is in line with the group operating model implemented in 2011

<<<

. The operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources, making strategic decisions

<<<

 and assessing performance of the group's mills, has been identified as corporate management. The mills have a direct reporting line to corporate management.
F-101

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued

<<<

)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Accounting policies applied in the segment reporting Recognition, measurement and classification applied in the segment reporting are consistent with the accounting principles applied for the consolidated

<<<

 income statement and balance sheet. The option in IFRS 8 allowing different accounting policies to be applied in the segment reporting and group reporting is, for transparency reasons, not applied in Norske Skog.
Performance measurement
The

<<<

 group assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of gross operating earnings (adjusted EBITDA) and gross operating earnings after depreciation (adjusted EBIT). These items exclude the effects of expenditure not deemed

<<<

 to be part of the regular operating activities of the segment, such as restructuring expenses, impairments, gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in fair value of certain energy contracts and biological assets.
Intercompany

<<<

 transactions The revenue reported per operating segment includes both sales to external parties and sales to other segments. Intra-segment sales are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. All sales transactions between operating

<<<

 segments are carried out at arm's length prices as if sold or transferred to independent third parties.
Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's

<<<

 entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic location in which the entity operates (the ``functional currency''). The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK, which is both the functional and presentational

<<<

 currency of the parent company.
b) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the entity's functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses

<<<

 resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses subject to

<<<

 hedge accounting and relating to currency positions qualifying as net investment hedges and which are hedge accounted, are booked as part of comprehensive income. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of accounts receivable/payable

<<<

 and unrealised gains/ losses on the same positions are recognised in Operating revenue/Cost of materials respectively. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of other items are recognised within Financial items. Foreign exchange gains

<<<

 and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement as Financial items.
c) Group companies The results and financial position of all group entities which have a functional currency different

<<<

 from the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
i. Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet,
ii. Income and expenses

<<<

 for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates, iii. All resulting exchange differences are booked to comprehensive income and presented in other
equity reserves.
F-102

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

<<<

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as

<<<

 hedges of such investments, are booked as part of comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves. When a foreign operation is fully or partially sold, such exchange differences are booked out of comprehensive income and recognised

<<<

 in the income statement line Other gains and losses as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings comprise mainly mills, machinery and office premises. All property, plant and equipment (PPE) is shown

<<<

 at historical cost less subsequent depreciation and impairments. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. The residual value of production equipment is defined as the realisable value after

<<<

 deduction of the estimated cost of dismantling and removal of the asset. If the estimated cost exceeds the estimated value, the net liability is added to the cost of the related asset, and a provision is recognised as a liability in the balance

<<<

 sheet. Borrowing costs which are directly related to qualifying assets are recognised as part of the acquisition cost for the qualifying asset. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,

<<<

 as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repair

<<<

 and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued

<<<

 amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. The residual value and useful life of assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to

<<<

 its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount, and included in the income statement line

<<<

 Other gains and losses.
Biological assets Biological assets are measured upon initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs, unless fair value cannot be reliably measured. A gain

<<<

 or loss arising on initial recognition, and from changes in fair value during a period, is reported in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises. When fair value cannot be reliably estimated, the asset is measured at cost less any

<<<

 accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets a) Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired

<<<

 subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill

<<<

 are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business

<<<

 combination in which the goodwill arose.
F-103

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
b) Patents and licenses
Patents and licenses have a finite useful life

<<<

 and are recognised at historical cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of patents and licences over their estimated useful lives.
c) Computer software
Acquired computer

<<<

 software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire the specific software and bring it into use, and amortised over their estimated useful lives. Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised

<<<

 as an expense as they are incurred. Costs which are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group, and which are likely to generate economic benefits exceeding the costs beyond

<<<

 one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of software development personnel and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their

<<<

 estimated useful lives.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation, but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation

<<<

 are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount

<<<

. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable (cash-generating

<<<

 units). At each balance sheet date, the possibility of reversing impairment losses in prior periods is evaluated (except for goodwill).
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified

<<<

 as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Financial

<<<

 assets
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available for sale. This classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were

<<<

 acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub

<<<

-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired principally for the purpose of short-term sale or if

<<<

 so designated by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within

<<<

 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Non-financial commodity contracts where the relevant commodity is readily convertible to cash, and where the contracts are not for own use, fall within the scope of IAS 39 F in a n c ia l In s tru m e n

<<<

 ts -- re c o g n itio n a n d m e a s u re m e n t. Such contracts are treated as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39. Norske Skog has a long-term energy contract in New Zealand that is treated as a derivative and measured at fair value through

<<<

 profit or loss. Furthermore, the energy contracts in Norway are nominated in EUR and contain embedded derivatives that are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. See
F-104

Notes 7, 8 and 9 for more information. Commodity contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as current assets, unless they are expected to be realised more than 12 months after

<<<

 the balance sheet date. In that case, they are classified as non-current assets.
b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments which are not quoted in an active market

<<<

. Loans and receivables maturing less than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as current assets and presented as Trade and other receivables or Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. Items maturing later than 12 months

<<<

 after the balance sheet date are presented within Other non-current assets.
c) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives which are either designated in this category or not classified in any

<<<

 of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless managem ent intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Derivatives and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value

<<<

 on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so

<<<

, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates derivatives as either:
a) Hedges of the fair value of fixed interest loans (fair value hedge),
b) Hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge),
c) Derivatives

<<<

 at fair value through profit or loss. Upon inception of a transaction, the group documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk managem ent objectives and strategy for undertaking various

<<<

 hedging transactions. The group also documents its assessment of whether the derivatives that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. This assessment is documented both at hedge inception

<<<

 and on an ongoing basis through the hedging period.
Accounting for derivatives follows the intentions underlying the associated contract. At the time a contract is entered into, it is defined as either a hedging or a trading contract. Norske

<<<

 Skog uses hedge accounting for a large amount of its economic hedging portfolio.
a) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as hedging and which are effective, are recorded in the income statement, together with

<<<

 any changes in the fair value of the of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The ineffective part of the hedging relationship is booked as an interest cost within Financial items. If the hedge no longer meets

<<<

 the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for which the effective interest method is used, is amortised over the period to maturity. Hedging instruments that are terminated prior to maturity

<<<

 will be treated in the same way. If the underlying hedged item is realised or repurchased prior to maturity, any associated hedging reserve/amortised cost is recognised in the income statement on a one-to-one basis.
b) Net investment hedge

<<<


Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) immediately in the income statement line Financial items. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the

<<<

 foreign operation is disposed of or sold.
c) Derivatives at fair value over profit or loss Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any of these derivative instruments are recognised in

<<<

 the income statement. The fair value of quoted investments is based on the current market price. If the market for a financial asset is not active, the group applies valuation techniques to establish the fair value. These include the use of

<<<

 recent arm 's length transactions, reference to other instruments which are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analyses defined to reflect the issuer's specific circumstances (see also Note 9).
Shares, bonds, certificates, bills

<<<

, etc. Shares, bonds and certificates classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are valued at market value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents

<<<

 include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Drawn bank overdrafts are shown as Interest-bearing current liabilities in the balance

<<<

 sheet.
Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or average purchase price. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw

<<<

 materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable

<<<

 variable selling expenses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently

<<<

 measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when objective evidence exists that the group will be unable to collect the entire

<<<

 amount due in accordance with the original terms of each receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that

<<<

 the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
Trade payables Trade payables

<<<

 are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest

<<<

 method.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and redemption value

<<<

 is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowing, using the effective interest method.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Fees

<<<

 paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs

<<<

. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings

<<<

 are classified as current liabilities, unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Interest costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which

<<<

 they are incurred.
Bond loans
The value of bond loans in the balance sheet is reduced by holdings of Norske Skog bonds. Amounts above or below amortised costs upon buy-back are recognised in the income statement in the same period the buy-back

<<<

 occurs.
Current and deferred income tax
The group's income tax expense includes current tax based on taxable profit in group companies, change of deferred income taxes for the financial period and adjustments to previous periods. Tax is recognised

<<<

 in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively

<<<

.
The tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the com pany's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax is provided

<<<

 in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their tax bases.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that

<<<

 it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities when the deferred tax assets

<<<

 and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current deferred tax liabilities.
Pension obligations, bonus arrangements and other

<<<

 employee benefits a) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes. These are generally funded through payments to insurance companies, as determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The group has both defined benefit

<<<

 and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is one which defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The

<<<

 liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated

<<<

 annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds

<<<

 which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability, or alternatively a government bond interest rate if such bonds do not exist

<<<

.
F-107

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged

<<<

 or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into

<<<

 a separate entity. These contributions are made to publicly- or privately-administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made

<<<

. These contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the period the contribution relates to. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available

<<<

.
b) Share-based remuneration Up to and including 2012, the group had a long-term incentive plan where the allocation of synthetic options to members of corporate managem ent was based on the development of the com pany's share price in relation

<<<

 to a defined group of listed paper producers. The programme resulted in a cash payout if the options were exercised. The fair value of the liability was measured at each balance sheet date and on the settlement date. The plan was discontinued

<<<

 from 2013. See also Note 12.
c) Bonus arrangements The group accrues for bonus arrangements when there exists a contractual obligation, or past practice has created a constructive obligation.
Provisions Provisions for environmental restoration

<<<

, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle

<<<

 the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise mainly employee termination payments. Restructuring costs are costs which are not related to the ongoing operations. This includes for example severance

<<<

 (redundancy) payments, early retirement or other arrangements for employees leaving the company, external costs relating to coaching, counselling and assistance finding new jobs, or external costs to lawyers and legal advisors in relation to

<<<

 the de-manning process, and lease termination penalties. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Salary which is earned while the employee contributes to the ongoing operations is not classified as restructuring costs. This

<<<

 includes for example salary in the notice period when the employee is working during the notice period, or bonuses earned whilst the employee contributes to the normal operations. These are booked as normal employee benefit expenses. Costs

<<<

 for projects related to improvements are generally ordinary operating costs. W here a number of similar obligations exist, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as

<<<

 a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure

<<<

 required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised

<<<

 within Financial items.

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received

<<<

 or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the group's activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group. The group's revenue consists

<<<

 almost exclusively of the sale of goods, and the principle for recognition of revenue is the same for newsprint and magazine paper. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred

<<<

 to the buyer. This will depend upon the buyer's delivery terms and will be in the range from the finalisation of the production to delivery of the goods to the buyer. The group's terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2010, which are the

<<<

 official rules for the interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Cham ber of Commerce. The timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on these delivery terms. The group's sales are covered by the following main categories

<<<

 of terms:  ``D'' terms, where the group delivers the goods to the purchaser at the agreed destination, usually
the purchaser's premises. The point of sale is when the goods are delivered to the purchaser. If the customer is invoiced before

<<<

 delivery of the goods purchased, revenue is only recognised if the customer has taken over a significant part of the gain and loss potential related to those goods,  ``C '' terms, where the group arranges and pays for the external transport

<<<

 of the goods, but the group no longer bears any responsibility for the goods once they have been handed over to the transporter in accordance with the terms of the contract. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter

<<<

 contracted by the seller,  ``F'' terms, where the purchaser arranges and pays for the transport. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the purchaser.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised

<<<

 when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. This is the interest rate that gives a net present value of the cash flow from the loan that is equal to its

<<<

 carrying value.
Leases Leases in which the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis

<<<

 over the period of the lease. Leases relating to property and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet to the lower

<<<

 of the fair value of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charge and reduction of the outstanding liability, giving a constant periodic rate of interest on the

<<<

 remaining balance of the liability. The leased property is depreciated according to the same principles applied for other non-current assets. The corresponding rental obligation, net of finance charges, is included in other long-term payables

<<<

. If the leasing period is shorter than the economic life of the asset and it is unlikely that the group will purchase the asset at the end of the leasing period, the asset is depreciated over the leasing period.

 ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Government grants Government grants (except for emission rights, described below) are recognised as income over the period necessary to match

<<<

 the grants on a systematic basis to the costs that they are intended to compensate for. Government grants in the form of compensation for losses which have already been incurred, or in the form of direct financial support which is not directly

<<<

 related to future costs, are recognised as income in the same period as they are awarded. Government grants related to assets are presented in the balance sheet as deferred income or as a reduction of the cost price of the assets the grant

<<<

 relates to. The grant is then recognised in the income statement either through future periodic income recognition or as a future reduction in the depreciation charge.
Emission Rights There is no accounting standard or interpretation in IFRS

<<<

 regarding the accounting treatment for emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. Received allowances are recognised in the balance sheet as intangible assets at the market value on the date the rights are granted. The difference

<<<

 between fair value and the nominal amount paid for the rights is recognised in the balance as a government grant (deferred income). Emissions are recognised in the income statement as Cost of materials, and the government grant (deferred revenue

<<<

) is recognised concurrently with emission costs. Unused credits (deferred income) and used allowances are netted against the carrying amount of intangible asset recognised in the balance sheet, when the individual contracts for emission allowances

<<<

 fall due for settlement. If the received allowances are sufficient to cover the com pany's emissions, there will be no net cost or net income in gross operating earnings. If it is necessary to acquire additional allowances on the open market

<<<

, a provision is made based on actual emissions. If the number of allowances received exceeds actual consumption, the surplus is sold in the market. The gain/loss from the sale is presented as Other gains and losses.
New and amended interpretations

<<<

 and standards adopted by the group The following standards are mandatory for the first time for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013:
IAS 1 Financial statement presentation (amendment) The main change resulting from the am endm

<<<

 ent is that items in the statement of other comprehensive income that will be reclassified to profit or loss at a future point in time are now presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The standard has been adopted with

<<<

 effect from 1 January 2013, and presentation in the statement of other comprehensive income has been updated in line with the amendment.
IAS 19 Employee benefits (revised) The revised standard requires that all actuarial gains and losses shall

<<<

 be recognised in other comprehensive income as they occur (i.e. elimination of the corridor approach), all past service costs shall be recognised immediately, and interest cost and expected return on plan assets shall be replaced with a net

<<<

 interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability (asset). The net interest element is classified within Financial items. The revised standard was implemented by Norske Skog from 1 January

<<<

 2013, with full retrospective application. See Note 13 for more information regarding the impact of the revised standard.

<<<

) IFRS 13 Fair value measurement The standard provides a precise definition of fair value and a gives a unified description of how fair value should be determined by IFRS, and defines what additional information should be provided when fair

<<<

 value is used. The standard does not extend the use of fair value accounting, but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards. The standard has been adopted with effect from

<<<

 1 January 2013, and note disclosure for items that are measured at fair value has been updated in line with the standard.
IFRS 7-- Financial instruments: disclosures (amendment) The amendments require an entity to disclose information regarding

<<<

 the effect of netting arrangements on an entity's financial position. The am endm ent has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment (amendment) The am endm ent clarifies that major spare

<<<

 parts and servicing equipment that meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are not inventory. This has not had an impact on the financial statements as the changes had already been implemented.
New standards, interpretations and

<<<

 amendments to existing standards A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2014. None of these have been early adopted in 2013. New standards and amendments

<<<

 that are expected to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements are listed below:
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 10 builds on the existing principles that define the concept of control as the determining factor

<<<

 in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control. The standard is mandatory for annual periods beginning

<<<

 1 January 2014 or later. It is not expected that the standard will have a material impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 11 removes the option for jointly controlled entities to use proportionate consolidation

<<<

. Instead, the equity method of accounting must be used. The standard specifies two main categories of joint control: joint ventures and joint operations. For joint ventures, joint control is recognised in accordance with the equity method,

<<<

 but for joint operations, the parties shall recognise their rights in the assets and liabilities included in the collaboration. The standard is mandatory for annual periods beginning 1 January 2014 or later. It is not expected that the standard

<<<

 will have a material impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities The standard contains disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint ventures, associated companies

<<<

, special purpose entities and other off balance sheet entities. The standard is mandatory for annual periods beginning 1 January 2014 or later. It is not expected that it will have a material impact on presentation in the financial statements

<<<

.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments

<<<

. The new standard requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement
F-111

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
categories: those measured at

<<<

 fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is m ade at initial recognition, and depends on the entity's business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial

<<<

 assets. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The group has not fully assessed the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9.
IAS 27 Separate financial statements

<<<

 (revised)
The rules for consolidated financial statements are replaced by the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12. What remains of IAS 27 is limited to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in separate financial statements

<<<

. The changes are mandatory for annual periods beginning 1 January 2014 or later. The changes are not expected to have a significant impact on the separate financial statements.
IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures (revised)
As

<<<

 a consequence of the new IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, IAS 28 has been renamed, and the standard now describes the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates. The change is mandatory for annual periods

<<<

 beginning 1 January 2014 or later. It is not expected that the change will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
IAS 32-- Financial instruments: presentation (amendment)
The amendments clarify some of the requirements for offsetting

<<<

 financial assets and financial liabilities in the balance sheet. The changes are effective for annual periods beginning on 1 January 2014 or later. It is not expected that the changes will have a significant impact on the financial statements

<<<

.
Important accounting estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions for the future. It also requires managem ent to exercise its judgem ent

<<<

 in the process of applying the group's accounting policies. Estimates and assumptions which represent a substantial risk for significant changes in the capitalised value of assets and liabilities during the coming fiscal year are discussed

<<<

 below.
a) Estimated decline in value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (PPE)
The group performs periodic tests to assess whether there has been a decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE. These are written down

<<<

 to their recoverable amount when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount from assets or cash-generating units is determined by calculating the higher of fair value less costs to sell and

<<<

 value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates.
The group's cash-generating units are Europe newsprint

<<<

, Australasia newsprint, Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) and Norske Skog Saugbrugs (Norway) magazine paper (supercalendered (SC)). The cash-generating unit Europe newsprint consists of Norske Skog Golbey (France), Norske Skog

<<<

 Bruck Paper Machine 3 (Austria) and Norske Skog Skogn (Norway). The cash-generating unit Australasia newsprint consists of Norske Skog Albury (Australia), Norske Skog Boyer (Australia) and Norske Skog Tasman (New Zealand). The cash-generating

<<<

 unit Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) consists of Norske Skog Walsum (Germany) and Norske Skog Bruck Paper Machine 4 (Austria). In cases where several mills are part of a cash-generating unit, this is because production can

<<<

 be moved between the mills, based on what gives best profitability for the group as a whole.
The capitalised value of intangible assets and PPE within the cash-generating units is measured against the value in use of intangible assets and PPE

<<<

 within these units. A possible future change in the composition of the group's cash-generating units could lead to changes in the value in use within these
F-112

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued

<<<

)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
cash-generating units, which could in turn mean a future decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
Calculating the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within the cash-generating units is based

<<<

 on estimated discounted cash flows. The cash flow horizon in the impairment model is consistent with the useful life of each paper machine in the group. The board-approved operating plan for the next year forms the basis for calculating expected

<<<

 future cash flows. In the impairment testing, sales prices are assumed to exhibit a decline in real terms and variable costs are assumed to decline in real terms, with lower demand for input factors due to a shrinking industry.
The estimation

<<<

 of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty

<<<

 when it comes to the outcome of the calculations. Norske Skog performs sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations will impact recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation

<<<

 of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate used. Changes in these factors will have the effect of altering the value of cash flows

<<<

 and thereby also the value in use within the cash-generating units. Significant changes in prognoses and long-term prices could accordingly mean a future fall in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
The required rate of return applied when

<<<

 discounting future cash flows is crucial for the calculated value of intangible assets and PPE. A future increase in the required rate of return when discounting future cash flows will reduce value in use and could in turn mean a future decline

<<<

 in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
b) Annual assessment of the remaining economic life of PPE
The group conducts annual reviews of the remaining economic life of PPE. An increase or decrease in the remaining economic life will have

<<<

 an impact on future depreciation, as well as affect the cash flow horizon for calculating value in use. Economic life is estimated by considering the expected usage, physical wear and tear, as well as technical and commercial development. Assessment

<<<

 of future developments in demand in the markets Norske Skog's products are sold is central to the assessment of the economic life of the group's mills. Expected future dem and, together with the competitiveness of Norske Skog's mills, is crucial

<<<

 for the determination of economic life. In addition, legal or other restrictions relating to usage could affect the economic life of the mills in the group.
c) Provision for future environmental obligations
The group's provision for future

<<<

 environmental obligations is based on a number of assumptions made using m anagem ent's best judgment. Changes in any of these assumptions could have an impact on the group's provision and group costs. See Note 20 for further information.
d

<<<

) Residual value and dismantling provision
The residual value of the group's production equipment is valued as the anticipated realisable value on the balance sheet date, after deducting the estimated costs relating to asset dismantling, removal

<<<

 and restoration. If the estimated costs exceed the estimated residual values, the net liability is added to the fixed asset cost in the balance sheet and a provision is recognised as a liability. The group performs a review of the residual

<<<

 value of its production equipment at the end of each accounting year. Residual value is affected by short-term changes in the underlying assumptions, for example scrap metal prices. A change in the residual value could have an impact on future

<<<

 depreciation costs. The provision for dismantling costs is based on a number of assumptions made using m anagem ent's best judgment. See Note 20 for further information.

 STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) e) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques

<<<

. The group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. See Note 9 for more information.
f) Pensions The present value of the pension

<<<

 obligation depends on several input factors that are determined by means of a number of actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the net pension expense (income) include the discount rate, salary adjustment and pension increase

<<<

. Changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying value of the pension obligation.
3. OPERATING SEGMENTS Reportable segments The group is divided into two operating segments: newsprint and magazine paper. The segment selection is based

<<<

 on the products manufactured and on the organisational structure used in the group's internal performance measurement and resource allocation. The newsprint segment is further divided into two geographical regions, newsprint Europe and newsprint

<<<

 outside Europe. At the end of 2013, Norske Skog had ten fully or partly owned paper mills in eight countries. Two of the mills produce only magazine paper, one produces both magazine paper and newsprint and seven produce newsprint only. Both

<<<

 the newsprint and the magazine paper segment represent an aggregation of the paper machines in the group producing the two paper qualities.
Newsprint The newsprint segment encompasses production and sale of standard newsprint and other paper

<<<

 qualities used in newspapers, inserts, catalogs, etc. These paper qualities, measured in grammes per square meter, will normally be in the range 40-57 g/m 2.
Magazine paper The magazine paper segment encompasses production and sale of the paper

<<<

 qualities super calendered (SC), machine finished coated (MFC) and light weight coated (LWC). These paper qualities are used in magazines, periodicals, catalogs and brochures.
Other activities Activities in the group that do not fall into the

<<<

 operating segments newsprint or magazine paper are presented under other activities. This includes purchase and resale of energy to the group's mills, corporate functions, real estate activities and the purchase and resale of wood. Following

<<<

 the divestment of the global recovered paper business Reparco in 2012, the group no longer has operating revenue or gross operating earnings related to recovered paper. Amounts relating to recovered paper in 2012 are included within other activities

<<<

.
Revenues and expenses not allocated to operating segments Norske Skog manages non-current debt, taxes and cash positions on a group basis. Consequently, financial items and tax expenses are presented only for the group as a whole. The group

<<<

's investment in associated companies accounted for in accordance with the equity method is primarily related to its 33.7% share in Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd., which is described in more detail in Note 19 Investments in associated

Norske Skog owns forests in Australia. These assets are valued at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs. Changes in value are reported in the income statement line Other gains and losses. Machinery and equipment

<<<

 is depreciated over a period from ten to 25 years. Buildings and other property are depreciated over a period from ten to 40 years. Fixtures and fittings are depreciated over a period from three to ten years. Land and plant under construction

<<<

 are not depreciated.

The difference between total additions and purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets in the consolidated statement of cash flows is due to capitalised allocated emission allowances, finance leases,

<<<

 capitalised borrowing costs and accruals for payments. Capitalised borrowing costs in 2013 amounted to NOK 14 million, and the interest rate used was 8%. There were no capitalised borrowing costs in 2012.

Disposals in 2013 were primarily related

<<<

 to the divestments of Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil and Norske Skog (Thailand) Com pany Ltd. in Thailand, as well as scrapping of fully depreciated assets that no longer have any technical value. Disposals in 2012 were primarily related

<<<

 to the divestments of Papeles Norske Skog Bio Bio S.A. in Chile, Norske Skog Follum AS in Norway, Norske Skog Parenco B.V. in the Netherlands and the global recovered paper business, Reparco.

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued)
Assumptions

<<<

 applied when calculating the recoverable amount
PPE and intangible non-current assets are written down to their recoverable amount when this is lower than the carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating

<<<

 unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from an asset or cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies the value in use approach when

<<<

 calculating recoverable amount for its cash-generating units.
When calculating value in use, the group is divided into the following cash-generating units: Europe newsprint, Australasia newsprint, Europe magazine paper (light weight coated

<<<

 (LWC)) and Norske Skog Saugbrugs (Norway) magazine paper (super-calendered (SC)). The cash-generating unit Europe newsprint consists of Norske Skog Golbey (France), Norske Skog Bruck Paper Machine 3 (Austria) and Norske Skog Skogn (Norway)

<<<

. The cash-generating unit Australasia newsprint consists of Norske Skog Albury (Australia), Norske Skog Boyer (Australia) and Norske Skog Tasman (New Zealand). The cash-generating unit Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) consists

<<<

 of Norske Skog Walsum (Germany) and Norske Skog Bruck Paper Machine 4 (Austria). In cases where several mills are part of a cash-generating unit, this is because production can be moved between the mills, based on what gives best profitability

<<<

 for the group as a whole.
Norske Skog calculates the value in use in the impairment testing by using a weighted average cost of capital model (WACC).
Nominal cash flow is estimated in the currency in which it will be generated. The value is

<<<

 calculated by discounting based on a required rate of return on capital that is relevant for the cash-generating unit or the individual asset. The required rate of return is based on the interest rate on ten year government bonds in the currency

<<<

 of the cash flow estimate, an industry debt yield premium, industry beta and an equity risk premium. In certain instances, a country-specific risk premium relevant to the cash-generating unit or individual asset has been added.
W hen calculating

<<<

 value in use at the end of 2013, the discount rate after tax was in the interval from 6.1% to 8.1% (6.3% to 14.6% in 2012). The applied discount rate for Europe newsprint was in the interval from 6.5% to 6.9% , Australasia newsprint was in

<<<

 the interval from 7.9% to 8.1% , Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) was in the interval from 6.1% to 6.5% and Norske Skog Saugbrugs (Norway) magazine paper (super-calendered (SC)) was 6.9%.
Cash flow is calculated individually

<<<

 for each business unit, based on the estimated useful life. The paper industry is a capital intensive industry where investment decisions are made based on projects with a long time horizon. The production machines have a long technical life

<<<

, while useful lives are linked to industry cost curves and the size of the market. The estimated remaining useful life of the individual paper machines forms the basis for determining the length of the cash flow period. For both sales prices

<<<

 and input prices, a continued decline in real terms is expected, as historically observed. Sales volumes develop in accordance with the useful lives of the different paper machines in the group. Projections of these assumptions result in a

<<<

 gradual improvement in margins, from depressed levels at the current point in the business cycle to a normalisation with economic activity. The impairment testing at 31 Decem ber 2013 was based on the operating plan for the group for 2014 as

<<<

 approved by the board of directors.
The cash flow decreases gradually over time as the capacity of the group declines, reflecting assumed closures of machines as they reach the end of their useful lives.
Sensitivity to estimates of recoverable

<<<

 amount
The estimation of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there

<<<

 will be uncertainty when it comes to the outcome of these calculations. Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations will impact recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions

<<<

 made in the
F-119

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Continued)
calculation of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable

<<<

 amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate used. A reduction in sales price and sales volumes for the whole group in the cash flow period of 5% will cause a reduction in recoverable

<<<

 amount in the order of NOK 3 200 million and NOK 1 500 million respectively. Correspondingly, a 1% increase in the discount rate will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 1 000 million. An appreciation of NOK of 1% against all

<<<

 other functional currencies in the Norske Skog group will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 400 million.

Expected useful life
Norske Skog has conducted sensitivity analyses with respect

<<<

 to changes in expected useful life of the group's paper machines. If the expected useful life of all the group's paper machines is reduced by one year, the annual depreciation charge will increase by around NOK 100 million.
In connection with

<<<

 the year-end closing process for 2013, Norske Skog performed a review of the expected remaining useful lives of PPE. No changes in useful life will be made in 2014 compared to those applied in 2013. Due to the fact that the level of depreciation

<<<

 in 2013 exceeded purchases of PPE, the future annual depreciation amount is expected to decrease.

(2) The fair value of current borrowings equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not considered to be significant.
There is some uncertainty associated with

<<<

 the calculated fair value of interest-bearing liabilities. The fair value calculation is based on acknowledged valuation principles according to IFRS, but is not necessarily an estimate of the amount the group would have to cover if it were

<<<

 to repay all its debt to all lenders.

8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
Norske Skog is exposed to various financial risk factors through the group's operating activities, including market risk (interest rate risk

<<<

, currency risk and commodity risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. Norske Skog seeks to minimise losses and volatility on the group's earnings caused by adverse market movements. Moreover, Norske Skog monitors and manages financial risk based

<<<

 on internal policies and standards set forth by corporate management and approved by the board of directors. These written policies provide principles for the overall risk management as well as standards for managing currency risk, interest

<<<

 rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and standards is continuously monitored. There were no breaches of these policies during 2013 or

<<<

 2012.

Market Risk
a) Interest rate risk
The goal of interest rate risk management is to secure the lowest possible interest rate payments over time within acceptable risk limits. In the current challenging situation in the publication paper

<<<

 market, Norske Skog has secured most of the interest rate payments by primarily paying fixed interest rates on its loan obligations.

The interest rate swap in the fair value hedge portfolio was terminated in 2012.

In te re s t rate s e n s itiv ity analysis
In accordance with IFRS

<<<

 7 F in a n c ia l in s tru m e n ts --d is c lo s u re s , an interest rate sensitivity analysis is presented showing the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest costs and interest income, as well as equity where applicable

<<<

. The analysis is based on the following assumptions:
 Floating rate debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates, i.e. the interest costs or interest income associated with such instruments will fluctuate based on changes in market

<<<

 rates. These changes are accounted for in the sensitivity analysis. The result is based on the assumption that all other factors are kept constant.
 Changes in market rates on fixed rate debt will only affect the income statement if they are

<<<

 measured at fair value. Thus, fixed rate instruments recognised at amortised cost will not represent an interest rate risk as defined by IFRS 7. Such instruments will therefore not have any influence on the sensitivity analysis.

group

<<<

's liabilities, and which are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, are taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis.  Currency derivatives will only affect the sensitivity analysis to a very limited extent upon

<<<

 changes in the discount rate.  Results are presented net of tax, using the Norwegian statutory tax rate of 28%. The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on a parallel shift in the yield curve for each relevant currency to which Norske

<<<

 Skog is exposed. Following a 50 basis point downward/upward parallel shift in the yield curve in all interest rate markets to which Norske Skog is exposed, net earnings would have been NOK 2 million higher/lower at 31 Decem ber 2013 (NOK 3

<<<

 million lower/higher at 31 Decem ber 2012). Change in net interest payments accounts for n Ok 1 million, and the total change in market values of derivatives carried at fair value through profit or loss accounts for NOK 1 million. Floating

b) Currency risk
Transaction r is k - c a s h flo w h e d g e The group has revenues and expenses in various currencies. The major currencies are NOK, EUR, USD, GBR AUD and NZD. Transaction

<<<

 risk arises because the group has a different currency split on income and expenses. Norske Skog calculates a 12-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling basis. The result of the hedging is included in Financial items in

<<<

 the income statement. Norske Skog does not use hedge accounting for the rolling cash flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a loss of NOK 66 million in 2013 (gain of NOK 149 million in 2012). Over time, currency losses or earnings

<<<

 are expected to offset increased or reduced future gross operating earnings.
T ranslation ris k -- n e t in v e s tm e n t h e d g e The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK. Currency translation risk arises when the financial

<<<

 statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies, are translated into NOK. In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition to traditional debt instruments, all combined currency

<<<

 and interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are also used for hedging net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Norske Skog's net investment hedging is carried out in accordance with IAS 39. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument

<<<

 relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity and offset by translation differences from assets in subsidiaries. The gain or loss related to the ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement

<<<

. There was no ineffectiveness related to net investment hedge in 2013 or 2012. The effective portion recognised in equity was a loss of NOK 243 million in 2013 (gain of NOK 2 million in 2012). Hedge accounting of USD loans was stopped in 2

The following foreign exchange sensitivity analysis calculates the sensitivity of derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments on net profit

<<<

 and equity, based on a defined appreciation/ depreciation of NOK against relevant currencies, keeping all other variables constant. The analysis is based on several assumptions, including:
 Norske Skog as a group comprises entities with different

<<<

 functional currencies. Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments of a monetary nature, denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity, create foreign exchange rate exposure on the consolidated income

<<<

 statement. Moreover, foreign currency risk will also affect equity.
 Financial instruments denominated in the functional currency of the entity have no currency risk and will therefore not be applicable to this analysis. Furthermore, the foreign

<<<

 currency exposure of translating financial accounts of subsidiaries into the group's presentational currency is not part of this analysis.
 Sensitivity on commodity contracts and embedded derivatives is presented separately under ``Commodity

<<<

 risk''.
 Currency derivatives and foreign currency debt that are designated as net investment hedges and qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39 will only affect equity.
 Other currency derivatives that are recognised at fair value

<<<

 through profit and loss will affect the income statement. These effects come mainly from currency derivatives designated as hedging of the group's 12-month rolling cash flow exposure, and financial liabilities managed as economic net investment

<<<

 hedges which do not qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39.
 Other non-derivative financial instruments accounted for in the analysis comprise cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accounts receivable and borrowings denominated

<<<

 in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity.
 Correlation effects between currencies are not taken into account. Figures are presented net of tax.
At 31 December 2013, if NOK had appreciated 10% against all currencies

<<<

 to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 265 million higher (NOK 292 million higher at 31 December 2012). If NOK had depreciated by 10% at 31 December 2013 against all

<<<

 currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 285 million lower (NOK 292 million lower at 31 December 2012). Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner

<<<

 due to changes in the fair value of options. The effect of the sensitivity analysis on the income statement is mainly caused by changes in fair value of derivatives designated as rolling cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange gains/losses on

<<<

 the translation of EUR and USD denominated debt for which there is no hedge accounting. Due to the fact that the portion of debt has decreased in relation to the portion of cash, the effect on the income statement is lower in 2013 compared

<<<

 to 2012.
Given a 10% appreciation/depreciation of NOK, equity would have been NOK 189 million higher/lower (NOK 180 million higher/lower at 31 December 2012) as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on

 analysis on the income statement, calculated above.
c) Commodity risk
A major part of Norske Skog's global commodity dem and is secured through long-term contracts. Norske Skog only uses financial instruments to a limited extent to hedge these

<<<

 contracts. The hedging ratio represents a trade-off between risk exposure and the opportunity to take advantage of short-term price drops in the spot market. Hedging levels are regulated through mandates approved by the board of directors.

<<<


Some of Norske Skog's purchase and sales contracts are defined as financial instruments, or contain em bedded derivatives, which fall within the scope of IAS 39. These financial instruments and em bedded derivatives are measured in the balance

<<<

 sheet at fair value with value changes recognised through profit or loss. Commodity contracts are either financial contracts for the purpose of trading or hedging, or physical commodity contracts that are not for the purpose of own use. The

<<<

 em bedded derivatives are common in physical commodity contracts and comprise a wide variety of derivative characteristics.
Changes in fair value of commodity contracts reflect unrealised gains or losses and are calculated as the difference

<<<

 between market price and contract price, discounted to present value. Some commodity contracts are bilateral contracts or em bedded derivatives in bilateral contracts, for which there exists no active market. Therefore, valuation techniques

<<<

 are used as much as possible, with the use of available market information. Techniques that reflect how the market could be expected to price instruments are used in non-observable markets.
Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists

<<<

 mainly of physical energy contracts. Fair value of commodity contracts is especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of em bedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations

<<<

. The energy contracts in Norway are nominated in EUR. These contracts contain em bedded derivatives that are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. NOK weakened against EUR during 2013, which had a negative effect on the fair value of the

<<<

 em bedded derivatives.
In April 2013, Norske Skog Saugbrugs signed a new long-term energy contract for the supply of electricity for the paper mill in Halden. The new energy contract secures an annual supply of 1.0 TWh up to 31 Decem ber 2

<<<

020. The agreem ent entered into force on 1 May 2013. The contract ensures almost full energy coverage for Norske Skog Saugbrugs over the contract period. During 2013, Norske Skogindustrier ASA also terminated its long-term group energy contract

<<<

 from 1998 that applied for energy supply in Southern Norway.
In March 2012, Norske Skog sold long-term excess energy in Norway for NOK 170 million.

S e nsitivity a na lysis fo r c o m m o d ity c o n tra c ts
Trading and hedging mandates have

<<<

 been established for energy activity. Financial trading and hedging activities are carried out bilaterally with banks and trading companies.
W hen calculating fair value of future and forward contracts, cash flows are by principle assumed to

<<<

 occur in the middle of the period. Currency effects arise when contract values nominated in foreign currencies are translated into the reporting currency. Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner due to changes in the fair value

Liquidity risk
Norske Skog

<<<

 is exposed to liquidity risk in a scenario when the group's cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to cover payments of financial liabilities. In order to effectively mitigate liquidity risk, Norske Skog's liquidity risk managem

<<<

 ent strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient cash, as well as securing available financing through committed credit facilities. Managing liquidity risk is centralised on a group level.
In order to uncover future liquidity risk, Norske Skog

<<<

 forecasts both short- and long-term cash flows. Cash flow forecasts include cash flows stemming from operations, investments, financing activities and financial instruments. The group had current investments, cash and cash equivalents of NOK

<<<

 1 015 million at 31 Decem ber 2013 (NOK 1 194 million at 31 Decem ber 2012) and an undrawn credit facility of NOK 250 million at 31 Decem ber 2013 (undrawn credit facility of n Ok 1 028 million at 31 Decem ber 2012). See Note 11 for more information

<<<

 regarding the maturity of facilities. Restricted bank deposits amounted to NOK 258 million at 31 Decem ber 2013 (NOK 211 million at 31 Decem ber 2012).
At the end of 2013, Norske Skog had cash holdings and credit lines that provided sufficient

<<<

 liquidity to meet debt maturities in 2014. However, the board of directors recognises the challenging markets that Norske Skog operates in, and the seasonally lower cash flow in the first half of the year. As a consequence, the board of directors

<<<

 has continuous focus on having sufficient cash flow for operations throughout 2014. To ensure sufficient liquidity for both debt maturities and operations Norske Skog has, in addition to improving cash flow from operations, a number of ongoing

<<<

 and possible initiatives that, in the opinion of the board of directors, should in total provide sufficient cash flows during 2014.
The following table shows the contractual maturities of non-derivative financial liabilities and other derivative

<<<

 financial instruments. All amounts disclosed in the table are undiscounted cash flows. Furthermore, amounts denominated in foreign currency are translated to NOK using closing rates at 31 December. These amounts consist of trade payables, interest

<<<

 payments and principal payments on derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Variable rate interest cash flows are calculated using the forward yield curve. Projected interest payments are based on the maturity schedule at 31 Decem

<<<

 ber without accounting for forecasted refinancing and/or other changes in the liability portfolio. All other cash flows are based on the group's positions held at 31 Decem ber 2013.

 evaluation of all financial trading counterparties. Based on the evaluation, a limit on credit exposure is established for each counterparty. These limits are monitored continuously in relation to unrealised profit on financial instruments

 and placements. The maximum credit risk arising from financial instruments is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets in the balance sheet. This includes derivatives with positive market value except for embedded derivatives

. Embedded derivatives are not subjected to credit risk, as there are no future cash flows associated with such derivatives.
Norske Skog trades with a group of large Nordic and international banks which are publicly rated in the interval from

Norske Skog's procedures for credit management of European trade receivables, and the authority to approve credit lines to customers of European

 is calculated by using quotes from actively traded markets when available. Otherwise, price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used. Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 are recognised

<<<

 in the balance sheet and valued on the same principle as financial contracts. Some of these are long-term energy contracts. In calculating the fair value of embedded derivatives, valuation techniques are used in the absence of observable market

<<<

 inputs. Embedded currency options are calculated using a Black 76 valuation model, where some input assumptions have been made in absence of an active long-term option market.
The following table is presented in accordance with IFRS 7.27, showing

 the fair value of commodity contracts in level 3 given a change in assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative.

NET INTEREST-BEARING DEBT

As a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the beginning of 2009, an amount was reclassified in the balance sheet. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting

 to NOK 185 million is included in interest-bearing debt as at 31 Decem ber 2013 (NOK 196 million at 31 Decem ber 2012). The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement

 over the term of the debt that has been hedged (i.e. until 2033).
At 31 Decem ber 2013, the group's holding of own bonds amounted to NOK 170 million of Norwegian bonds (NOK 163 million at 31 Decem ber 2012). The group's holding of own bonds

 in foreign currency amounted to USD 42 million and EUR 132 million at 31 Decem ber 2013 (USD 42 million and EUR 132 million at 31 Decem ber 2012). These holdings are deducted from interest-bearing debt in NOK.

 each year. This scheme involves no dilution effect.
The programme was continued for 2010 with some changes: the maximum annual bonus from the programme was set to NOK 4 million for the CEO and NOK 2 million for other members of corporate managem

The defined benefit schemes in Norway cover people between

<<<

 55 and 67 years of age, who were employed before 1 January 2011. The defined benefit obligations in Norway only encompass active members (a small number of people in early retirement until the end of 2015), since they leave the defined benefit

<<<

 scheme (having a paid-up policy) when they retire.

Plan assets of the pension schemes in Norske Skogindustrier ASA, Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS and Norske Skog Skogn AS are managed by a life insurance com pany and invested in accordance with

<<<

 the general guidelines governing investments by life insurance companies in Norway. With effect from the beginning of 2011, a new defined contribution scheme was introduced in Norway, with a contribution of 4% for earnings between 1 and 6 G

<<<

 and 8% between 6 and 12 G. The defined benefit plan was closed and now only covers employees born before 1 January 1959 who were employed before the closure.

W hen evaluating plan assets, their estimated value at 31 Decem ber is used. This

<<<

 estimated value is corrected every year in accordance with the figures for the market value of the assets provided by the insurance company.

Expected return on plan assets is based on historical return and the investment profile of the plan

<<<

 assets.

W hen measuring incurred obligations, the estimated obligation at 31 Decem ber is used. This estimated obligation is corrected every year in accordance with the figures for incurred pension obligations provided by the actuary.

In

<<<

 addition to the benefit obligation funded through insurance plans, the group has unfunded benefit obligations, of which Norske Skog Walsum GmbH is the largest. The defined benefit scheme at Norske Skog Walsum GmbH was curtailed at the level

<<<

 it had at 31 Decem ber 2010, meaning there is no increase in the obligation as a result of salary increases or the time worked for the com pany after this date. The majority of employees covered by the defined benefit scheme at Norske Skog

<<<

 Walsum are in their late fifties and sixties. The unfunded obligations also include estimated future obligations relating to the former Norwegian early retirement scheme, pensions to former owners of subsidiaries as well as pensions for senior

<<<

 managem ent and directors. Obligations relating to senior managem ent pensions are partly funded through a supplementary retirement plan with a life insurance company.

In addition to defined benefit plans, there are also various defined contribution

<<<

 plans.

ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED IAS 19-- RESTATEMENT OF 2012 FIGURES
Norske Skog implemented the amended standard IAS 19 E m p lo y e e b e n e fits from 1 January 2013, with full retrospective application

<<<

. Comparable figures for 2012 have been restated, except for changes to the carrying value of assets that include employee benefit costs in the carrying value (property, plant and equipment and inventories).
The most significant change in the

<<<

 amended IAS 19 is the removal of the corridor approach for actuarial gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses are now recognised in the balance sheet immediately, with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income (OCI) in the periods

<<<

 in which they occur. These are not reclassified to profit or loss in later periods.
In accordance with the amended standard, the interest expense (income) is calculated on the net defined benefit liability (asset) by applying the discount rate

<<<

 to the net defined benefit liability (asset). The net interest element is classified within Financial items. The comparable figures for 2012 in the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet have been restated.

SENSITIVITY

<<<

 ANALYSIS
Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses for the most important assumptions related to defined benefit schemes to predict how fluctuations will impact pension liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. In relation to the

<<<

 assumptions made in the calculation of pension obligations the amount is most

The net loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment in 2013 of NOK 178 million was primarily related to the divestments of Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil and Norske Skog (Thailand

<<<

) Co. Ltd. in Thailand.
On 14 June 2013, Norske Skog signed an agreem ent for the sale of 51% of its shares in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil. The transaction was completed on 27 June 2013. The total loss of NOK 218 million on the divestment

<<<

 consisted of NOK 95 million relating to the divestment of 51% of the shares, and NOK 123 million relating to the remaining 49% stake which was recognised in the balance sheet as an associated com pany in line with the equity method of accounting

<<<

 at 31 Decem ber 2013. The loss on the remaining 49% stake consisted of the difference between the book value of the net assets derecognised and the fair value of the investment in associated company. See Note 19 Investments in associated companies

<<<

 for more information. The loss on the divested 51% stake included NOK 12 million relating to currency translation differences and net investment hedge that were recognised directly in equity during the ownership period and reclassified to Other

 gains and losses upon loss of control.
On 5 October 2013, Norske Skog signed an agreem ent for the sale of its shares in the com pany that owns and operates the mill at Singburi in Thailand, Norske Skog (Thailand) Co. Ltd. The transaction was

<<<

 completed on 21 November 2013. Norske Skog Singburi was deconsolidated from this date and a gain of NOK 49 million was recognised. This amount included a gain of NOK 35 million related to currency translation differences that were recognised

)
The net loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment also included a loss of NOK 26 million in relation to input VAT on transaction costs incurred upon the divestments of mills in South Korea and China in previous

<<<

 years. The Norwegian VAT authorities claim that this amount is not deductible. However, Norske Skog does not agree with this claim and expects to take out legal proceedings. Norske Skog has no outstanding payments to the VAT authorities in

<<<

 relation to this amount and has expensed the full amount in 2013, due to uncertainty regarding the outcome of this case. The remaining amount included in the net loss on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment included

<<<

 a gain of NOK 23 million on divestments of non production related property.
The gain on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment in 2012 of NOK 39 million was primarily related to the divestments of Papeles Norske Skog

<<<

 Bio Bio S.A. in Chile, Norske Skog Follum AS in Norway, Norske Skog Parenco B.V, in the Netherlands and the global recovered paper business, Reparco (in total NOK 38 million). The remaining amount was mainly related to the sale of non-production

<<<

 related property.
Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists mainly of physical energy contracts. The fair value of commodity contracts is especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives

<<<

 in physical contracts is influenced by currency and price index fluctuations. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on profit after tax of fluctuations in energy prices, currency and price indices is given in Note 8. The valuation techniques

<<<

 used are described in Note 9. The losses on commodity contracts in 2013 and 2012 were due to lower expected future energy prices, and volumes utilised during 2013 and 2012. The gains and losses on embedded derivatives in 2013 and 2012 were

<<<

 mainly driven by currency fluctuations.
Other realised gains and losses of NOK -1 0 2 million in 2013 were primarily related to the termination of the long-term group agreement from1998 that applied to the supply of energy in Southern Norway

<<<

. Other realised gains and losses of NOK -1 5 2 million in 2012 were primarily related to the sale of 680 GWh of excess energy in Southern Norway. The sale generated a loss of NOK 153 million.

 jurisdictions. The table above summarises from which geographical areas the losses arose, as well as the portion of the losses that are not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
(1) In 2013, the amount was related to tax exemption on the divestment

 temporary differences.
(3) In 2012, an amount of NOK 5 956 million was added to tax losses to carry forward in Norway. This was a result of tax deductible losses that arose following a legal restructuring of the company structure. Deferred

 from 27 June 2013. Following the transaction, Norske Skog was no longer the controlling owner of the mill, and Norske Skog Pisa was therefore deconsolidated from 27 June 2013. Norske Skog's remaining share of 49% has been accounted for as an

 the terms of the sale of the remaining stake, with an accelerated timeline, and a sales price of USD 37 million. The value of the investment in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. at the end of December reflects the agreed sales price of USD 37 million

13 to permanently stop production at one paper machine (PM4). The machine ceased paper production in December 2013. Various other restructuring activities included provisions for severance payments and other costs of NOK 13 million as a result

<<<

 of the ongoing downsizing at head office and changes in corporate management, NOK 7 million at Norske Skog Bruck, and NOK 5 million at Norske Skog Boyer.
The amount expensed in 2013 in relation to restructuring activities amounted to NOK 1

due to the release of provisions expensed in 2012 at Norske Skog Tasman (NOK 6 million), Norske Skog Golbey (NOK 3 million) and Norske Skog Skogn (NOK 1 million). Total cash flow relating to restructuring activities in 2013 amounted to NOK

<<<

 122 million, and related mainly to Norske Skog Tasman (NOK 77 million), Norske Skog Walsum (NOK 20 million) and head office (NOK 13 million).
The restructuring provision at 31 Decem ber 2012 was NOK 140 million. The largest item in this provision

<<<

 (NOK 81 million) related to the decision to permanently close 160 000 tonnes of newsprint capacity at Norske Skog Tasman in New Zealand. Other provisions included NOK 28 million in relation to a cost reduction programme at Norske Skog Walsum

<<<

, NOK 12 million in relation to severance payments and other costs as a result of the ongoing downsizing at head office, NOK 6 million in relation to redundancies at Norske Skog Golbey and NOK 6 million in relation to redundancies at Norske

<<<

 Skog Skogn.
The amount expensed in 2012 in relation to restructuring activities amounted to NOK 118 million. This related mainly to the restructuring activities mentioned above (NOK 105 million at Norske Skog Tasman, NOK 17 million at head

<<<

 office, NOK 8 million at Norske Skog Golbey, and NOK 4 million at Norske Skog Skogn), as well as NOK 11 million related to severance payments and other costs following the closure of Norske Skog's shared service centre located in Antwerp in

<<<

 Belgium. These amounts were offset by the recognition of NOK 24 million income due to the release of provisions expensed in 2011 at Norske Skog Walsum (NOK 21 million) and Norske Skog Bruck (NOK 3 million), as a result of more employees working

<<<

 during the notice period than anticipated. Total cash flow relating to restructuring activities in 2012 amounted to NOK 182 million. This amount related mainly to Norske Skog Follum and Norske Skog Tasman.
Dismantling provision
Provisions related

<<<

 to future dismantling costs arising from a future closing down of production facilities amounted to NOK 56 million at 31 Decem ber 2013, compared to NOK 92 million at 31 Decem ber 2012. The total amount is classified as non-current and will

<<<

 only be realised at the time of a future shut down of any of the Norske Skog production units. The provision is the net present value of the future estimated costs, calculated using a long-term risk-free interest rate. The periodic unwinding

<<<

 of the discount is recognised in the income statement line Financial items. The opposite entry for dismantling provision and change in provision estimates is Property, plant and equipment.
Discount rates and assumptions included as part of

<<<

 the best estimate will impact the future carrying value of the dismantling provision. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction in the future discount rate of one percentage point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 4 million

<<<

, with a corresponding increase in future depreciation on property, plant and equipment.
Environmental provision
The group's provision for environmental obligations is presented in the balance sheet as Other non-current liabilities. The provision

<<<

 is related to estimated future costs for cleaning up any environmental pollution caused by Norske Skog production units. The provision will mainly be realised in a future period upon a potential shut down of the production activities of any

<<<

 of the Norske Skog production units. Increased environmental requirements from local governments may also lead to realisation of this provision at an earlier point in time.
Provisions for future environmental obligations amounted to NOK 19

<<<

3 million at 31 Decem ber 2013 compared to NOK 250 at 31 Decem ber 2012. The decrease in provision was mainly a result of a downwards revision of the environmental provision at the mills in Australasia and lower discount rates. Resources spent

<<<

 on environmental activities during 2013 amounted to NOK 4 million.
The carrying value of the provision is the best estimate made by measuring the expected value of the specific obligations, discounted to present value using a long-term risk

<<<

-free interest rate when the time value of money is material. Changes in factors included in the expected value will impact the carrying

24. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Norske Skog's objective when managing capital is to maximise return on equity within the limits set by the group's external debt financing

<<<

.
In order to improve the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

25. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Norske Skog is an international

<<<

 com pany that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and contracting parties. Norske Skog has an ongoing process related to simplification of the group's corporate structure

<<<

. This, in combination with changes in individual countries' tax laws, could increase the group's tax exposure. The group's assessment is that sufficient provisions have been made for the aforementioned conditions.

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<<<


1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Norske Skogindustrier ASA (``the com pany'') and its subsidiaries (together ``the group'') manufacture, distribute and sell publication paper. This includes newsprint and magazine paper. The group has 11 fully and partly

<<<

 owned mills on four continents.
Norske Skogindustrier ASA is incorporated in Norway and has its head office at Lysaker outside of Oslo. The com pany is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements were authorised

<<<

 for issue by the board of directors in Norske Skogindustrier ASA on 1 March 2013.
All amounts are presented in NOK million unless otherwise stated. There may be some small differences in the summation of columns due to rounding.
With effect

<<<

 from 2012, the annual financial statements will only be presented in English.
Reclassification in the balance sheet
A review of the classification of balance sheet items was performed during 2012. This resulted in reclassification of restructuring

<<<

 liabilities in the balance sheet from Trade and other payables to Other current liabilities. The modified classification is applied retrospectively, and comparative figures in the balance sheet have been restated. The change had an impact of

<<<

 NOK 140 million at 31 Decem ber 2012 and NOK 363 million at 31 Decem ber 2011.
2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Norske Skogindustrier ASA are set

<<<

 out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations

<<<

 from the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as adopted by the European Union (EU). They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of biological assets, available-for-sale financial assets and

<<<

 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Consolidation
a) S u b sid ia rie s
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding

<<<

 of more than half of the voting rights.
The group also assesses whether control exists where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power, but is able to govern the financial and operating policies by virtue of de-facto control. Important

<<<

 factors when assessing de-facto control are whether or not the group can choose the board of directors and whether the group's voting rights give the group the power to govern the financial and operating policies etc.
Subsidiaries are fully

<<<

 consolidated from the date at which control is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from the date on which such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between group companies are

<<<

 eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been am ended where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted

<<<

 by the group.
b) C ha ng e in o w n e rsh ip interests in s u b s id ia rie s w ith o u t lo ss o f c o n tro l
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Upon

<<<

 further acquisition of shares in subsidiaries from non-controlling interests, the difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the
F-159

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

<<<

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued) carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary, is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
c) D isp o sa

<<<

 l o f su bsid ia rie s W hen the group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair

<<<

 value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other com prehensive income in respect

<<<

 of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate

<<<

.
d) A ssociates Associates are all entities over which the group exercises significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% to 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the

<<<

 equity method of accounting. The investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The group

<<<

's share of post acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as Share of profit in associated companies and is assigned to the carrying value of the investment, together with the group's share of other comprehensive income

<<<

 in the associated company. W hen the group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations

<<<

 or made payments on behalf of the associate. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and its associates are recognised in the consolidated financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in

<<<

 the associates. At each reporting date, the group determines whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between

<<<

 the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and recognises the amount as Share of profit in associated companies. Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement. If

<<<

 the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
Segment

<<<

 reporting
R e p o rta b le se g m e n ts The activities in the group are divided into two operating segments: newsprint and magazine paper. The newsprint segment is further segregated into two geographical regions, newsprint Europe and newsprint

<<<

 outside of Europe. The segment structure is in line with the group operating model implemented in 2011. The operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The

<<<

 chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources, making strategic decisions and assessing performance of the group's mills, has been identified as corporate management. The mills have a direct reporting line to corporate

<<<

 management.

2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
A c c o u n tin g p o lic ie s a p p lie d in the s e g m e n t re p o rtin g Recognition, measurement

<<<

 and classification applied in the segment reporting are consistent with the accounting principles applied for the consolidated income statement and balance sheet. The option in IFRS 8 allowing different accounting policies to be applied in

<<<

 the segment reporting and group reporting is, for transparency reasons, not applied in Norske Skog.
P erform ance m easurem ent
The group assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of gross operating earnings (adjusted

<<<

 EBITDA) and gross operating earnings after depreciation (adjusted EBIT). These items exclude the effects of expenditure not deem ed to be part of the regular operating activities of the segment, such as restructuring expenses, impairments,

<<<

 gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in fair value of certain energy contracts and biological assets.
In te rc o m p a n y tran sactio n s The revenue reported per operating segment includes both sales to external parties

<<<

 and sales to other segments. Intra-segment sales are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. All sales transactions between operating segments are carried out at arm 's length prices as if sold or transferred to independent third

<<<

 parties.
Foreign currency translation
a) F u n ctio n a l a n d p re s e n ta tio n a l cu rre n c y Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic location

<<<

 in which the entity operates (the ``functional currency''). Functional currency for the group's activities in Brazil was changed from USD to BRL with effect from 2012, in order to more accurately reflect the primary economic environment in

<<<

 which the Pisa mill operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK, which is both the functional and presentational currency of the parent company.
b ) T ransactions a n d b a la n ce s Foreign currency transactions are

<<<

 translated into the entity's functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets

<<<

 and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses subject to hedge accounting and relating to currency positions qualifying as net investment hedges and which

<<<

 are hedge accounted, are booked as part of comprehensive income. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of accounts receivable/payable and unrealised gains/ losses on the same positions are recognised in Operating revenue/Cost of

<<<

 materials respectively. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of other items are recognised within Financial items. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income

<<<

 statement as Financial items.
c ) G rou p co m p an ies The results and financial position of all group entities which have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as

<<<

 follows:
i. Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet,
ii. Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates,

 SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
iii. All resulting exchange differences are booked to comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves.
On consolidation

<<<

, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are booked as part of comprehensive income and presented

<<<

 in other equity reserves. When a foreign operation is fully or partially sold, such exchange differences are booked out of comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value

<<<

 adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity, and translated at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings comprise mainly mills, machinery and

<<<

 office premises. All property, plant and equipment (PPE) is shown at historical cost less subsequent depreciation and impairments. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. The residual value

<<<

 of production equipment is defined as the realisable value after deduction of the estimated cost of dismantling and removal of the asset. If the estimated cost exceeds the estimated value, the net liability is added to the cost of the related

<<<

 asset, and a provision is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
Borrowing costs which are directly related to qualifying assets are recognised as part of the acquisition cost for the qualifying asset. Cost may also include transfers

<<<

 from equity of any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of PPE.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that

<<<

 future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repair and maintenance costs are charged to the

<<<

 income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values

<<<

 over their estimated useful lives.
The residual value and useful life of assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset

<<<

's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount, and included in the income statement line Other gains and losses.
Biological

<<<

 assets
Biological assets are measured upon initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs, unless fair value cannot be reliably measured. A gain or loss arising on initial recognition

<<<

, and from changes in fair value during a period, is reported in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises. When fair value cannot be reliably estimated, the asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated

<<<

 impairment losses.
Intangible assets
a) G o o d w ill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition

<<<

. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses

<<<

 on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
F-162

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued) Goodwill is

<<<

 allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is m ade to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill

<<<

 arose.
b) P atents a n d lice n se s
Patents and licenses have a finite useful life and are recognised at historical cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of patents

<<<

 and licences over their estimated useful lives.
c) C o m p u te r softw are
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire the specific software and bring it into use, and amortised over their

<<<

 estimated useful lives. Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as they are incurred. Costs which are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled

<<<

 by the group, and which are likely to generate economic benefits exceeding the costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of software development personnel and an appropriate portion of relevant

<<<

 overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment of non-financial assets Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject

<<<

 to amortisation, and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss

<<<

 is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment

<<<

, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable (cash-generating units). At each balance sheet date, the possibility of reversing impairment losses in prior periods is evaluated (except for goodwill

<<<

).
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered

<<<

 highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Financial assets
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables

<<<

, and available for sale. This classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. M anagem ent determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at

<<<

 every reporting date.
a) F in a n c ia l a ssets a t fa ir va lu e th ro u g h p ro fit o r lo ss
This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception

<<<

. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired principally for the purpose of short-term sale or if so designated by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless designated as hedges. Assets

<<<

 in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Non-financial commodity contracts where the relevant commodity is readily convertible

<<<

 to cash, and where the contracts are not for own use, fall within the scope of IAS 39 F in a n c ia l In s tru m e n ts --
F-163

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

<<<

 (Continued) r e c o g n itio n a n d m e a s u r e m e n t. Such contracts are treated as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39. Norske Skog currently has energy contracts in Norway that do not meet the own use criteria according to IAS 39

<<<

.5. The contracts must therefore be treated as derivatives and are booked to fair value through profit or loss (see also Notes 7, 8 and 9). Commodity contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as current assets, unless they are expected

<<<

 to be realised more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. In that case, they are classified as non-current assets.
b) L oa ns a n d re ce iva b le s
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable

<<<

 payments which are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables maturing less than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as current assets and presented as Trade and other receivables or Cash and cash equivalents in

<<<

 the balance sheet. Items maturing later than 12 months after the balance sheet date are presented within Other non-current assets.
c) A va ila b le -fo r-sa le fin a n c ia l assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives which

<<<

 are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless managem ent intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Derivatives

<<<

 and hedging Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the

<<<

 derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates derivatives as either:
a) Hedges of the fair value of fixed interest loans (fair value hedge),
b) Hedging of a net investment

<<<

 in a foreign operation (net investment hedge),
c) Derivatives at fair value through profit or loss. Upon inception of a transaction, the group documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk

<<<

 managem ent objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The group also documents its assessment of whether the derivatives that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged

<<<

 items. This assessment is documented both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis through the hedging period.
Accounting for derivatives follows the intentions underlying the associated contract. At the time a contract is entered into, it

<<<

 is defined as either a hedging or a trading contract. Norske Skog uses hedge accounting for a large amount of its economic hedging portfolio.
a) F air value h e d g e
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as hedging and which

<<<

 are effective, are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The ineffective part of the hedging relationship is booked as

<<<

 an interest cost within Financial items. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for which the effective interest method is used, is amortised over the period

<<<

 to maturity. Hedging instruments that are terminated prior to maturity will be treated in the same way. If the underlying hedged item is realised or repurchased prior to maturity, any associated hedging reserve/amortised cost is recognised

<<<

 in the income statement on a one-to-one basis.
F-164

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
b) N e t in ve stm e n t h e d g e Gains and losses on the hedging

<<<

 instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement line Financial items. Gains

<<<

 and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of or sold.
c ) D erivative s a t fa ir va lue o v e r p ro fit o r lo ss Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting

<<<

. Changes in the fair value of any of these derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement. The fair value of quoted investments is based on the current market price. If the market for a financial asset is not active, the group

<<<

 applies valuation techniques to establish the fair value. These include the use of recent arm 's length transactions, reference to other instruments which are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analyses defined to reflect the

<<<

 issuer's specific circumstances (see also Note 9).
Shares, bonds, certificates, bills, etc. Shares, bonds and certificates classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are valued at market value, with changes in fair

<<<

 value recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or

<<<

 less. Drawn bank overdrafts are shown as Interest-bearing current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method

<<<

, or average purchase price. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable

<<<

 value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary

<<<

 course of business. Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is

<<<

 established when objective evidence exists that the group will be unable to collect the entire amount due in accordance with the original terms of each receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor

<<<

 will enter bankruptcy, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated

<<<

 future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are recognised

<<<

 initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
F-165

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued) Borrowings

<<<


Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and redemption value is recognised in the

<<<

 income statement over the period of the borrowing, using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of

<<<

 the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment

<<<

 for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities, unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months

<<<

 after the balance sheet date. Interest costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Bond loans
The value of bond loans in the balance sheet is reduced by holdings of Norske Skog bonds. Amounts above or below

<<<

 amortised costs upon buy-back are recognised in the income statement in the same period the buy-back occurs.
Current and deferred income tax
The group's income tax expense includes current tax based on taxable profit in group companies, change

<<<

 of deferred income taxes for the financial period and adjustments to previous periods. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

<<<

 In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries

<<<

 where the com pany's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the

<<<

 consolidated financial statements and their tax bases.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses

<<<

 can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current

<<<

 tax assets against current deferred tax liabilities.
Pension obligations, bonus arrangements and other employee benefits
a) P e nsio n o b lig a tio n s
Group companies operate various pension schemes. These are generally funded through payments

<<<

 to insurance companies, as determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is one which defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive

<<<

 on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation

<<<

 at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and unrecognised past service

2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined

<<<

 by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of

<<<

 the related pension liability, or alternatively a government bond interest rate if such bonds do not exist.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions in excess of the greater

<<<

 of 10% of the value of plan assets or 10% of the defined benefit obligation are allocated to income over the em ployees' expected average remaining working lives.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless changes to the

<<<

 pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
A defined contribution

<<<

 plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. These contributions are m ade to publicly- or privately-administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group

<<<

 has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made. These contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the period the contribution relates to. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent

<<<

 that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b) S h are -b ase d rem un era tion
The group has a long-term incentive plan where the allocation of synthetic options to members of corporate m anagem ent is based on the

<<<

 development of the com pany's share price in relation to a defined group of listed paper producers. The programme results in a cash payout if the options are exercised. The fair value of the liability is measured at each balance sheet date

<<<

 and on the settlement date. See also Note 12.
c) B o nu s arrangem ents
The group accrues for bonus arrangements when there exists a contractual obligation, or past practice has created a constructive obligation.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental

<<<

 restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required

<<<

 to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise mainly employee termination payments. Restructuring costs are costs which are not related to the ongoing operations. This includes for example

<<<

 severance (redundancy) payments, early retirement or other arrangements for employees leaving the company, external costs relating to coaching, counselling and assistance finding new jobs, or external costs to lawyers and legal advisors in

<<<

 relation to the de-manning process, and lease termination penalties. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Salary which is earned while the employee contributes to the ongoing operations is not classified as restructuring

<<<

 costs. This includes for example salary in the notice period when the employee is working during the notice period, or bonuses earned whilst the employee contributes to the normal operations. These are booked as normal employee benefit expenses

<<<

. Costs for projects related to improvements are generally ordinary operating costs.
W here a number of similar obligations exist, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations

<<<

 as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included

<<<

 in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the

<<<

 time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised within Financial items.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received

<<<

 or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the group's activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group. The group's revenue consists

<<<

 almost exclusively of the sale of goods, and the principle for recognition of revenue is the same for newsprint and magazine paper.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred

<<<

 to the buyer. This will depend upon the buyer's delivery terms and will be in the range from the finalisation of the production to delivery of the goods to the buyer.
The group's terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2010, which are the

<<<

 official rules for the interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Cham ber of Commerce. The timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on these delivery terms. The group's sales are covered by the following main categories

<<<

 of terms:
 ``D'' terms, where the group delivers the goods to the purchaser at the agreed destination, usually the purchaser's premises. The point of sale is when the goods are delivered to the purchaser. If the customer is invoiced before

<<<

 delivery of the goods purchased, revenue is only recognised if the customer has taken over a significant part of the gain and loss potential related to those goods,
 ``C '' terms, where the group arranges and pays for the external transport

<<<

 of the goods, but the group no longer bears any responsibility for the goods once they have been handed over to the transporter in accordance with the terms of the contract. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter

<<<

 contracted by the seller,
 ``F'' terms, where the purchaser arranges and pays for the transport. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the purchaser.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised

<<<

 when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. This is the interest rate that gives a net present value of the cash flow from the loan that is equal to its

<<<

 carrying value.
Leases
Leases in which the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis

<<<

 over the period of the lease.
Leases relating to property and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet to the lower

<<<

 of the fair value of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charge and reduction of the outstanding liability, giving a constant periodic rate of interest on the

<<<

 remaining balance of the liability. The leased property is
F-168

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued) depreciated according to the same principles applied

<<<

 for other non-current assets. The corresponding rental obligation, net of finance charges, is included in other long-term payables. If the leasing period is shorter than the economic life of the asset and it is unlikely that the group will

<<<

 purchase the asset at the end of the leasing period, the asset is depreciated over the leasing period.
Government grants Government grants (except for emission rights, described below) are recognised as income over the period necessary to match

<<<

 the grants on a systematic basis to the costs that they are intended to compensate for. Government grants in the form of compensation for losses which have already been incurred, or in the form of direct financial support which is not directly

<<<

 related to future costs, are recognised as income in the same period as they are awarded. Government grants related to assets are presented in the balance sheet as deferred income or as a reduction of the cost price of the assets the grant

<<<

 relates to. The grant is then recognised in the income statement either through future periodic income recognition or as a future reduction in the depreciation charge.
Emission Rights There is no accounting standard or interpretation in IFRS

<<<

 regarding the accounting treatment for emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. Received allowances are recognised in the balance sheet as intangible assets at the market value on the date the rights are granted. The difference

<<<

 between fair value and the nominal amount paid for the rights is recognised in the balance as a government grant (deferred income). Emissions are recognised in the income statement as Cost of materials, and the government grant (deferred revenue

<<<

) is recognised concurrently with emission costs. Unused credits (deferred income) and used allowances are netted against the carrying amount of intangible asset recognised in the balance sheet, when the individual contracts for emission allowances

<<<

 fall due for settlement. If the received allowances are sufficient to cover the com pany's emissions, there will be no net cost or net income in gross operating earnings. If it is necessary to acquire additional allowances on the open market

<<<

, a provision is made based on actual emissions. If the number of allowances received exceeds actual consumption, the surplus is sold in the market. The gain/loss from the sale is presented as Other gains and losses.
Dividend distribution Dividend

<<<

 distribution to the com pany's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved in the general meeting.
New and am ended interpretations and standards adopted

<<<

 profit or loss at a future point in time must be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The am endm ent is effective for annual periods beginning 1 July 2012 or later.
IAS 19 E m p lo ye e b e n e fits (re vised) The

<<<

 revised standard requires that all actuarial gains and losses shall be recognised in other comprehensive income as they occur (i.e. elimination of the corridor approach), all past service costs shall be recognised immediately, and that interest

<<<

 cost and expected return on plan assets shall be replaced with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability (asset). The am endm ent is effective for annual periods beginning 1

<<<

 January 2013 or later. See Note 13 for more information regarding the impact of the revised standard.
IAS 2 7 S e pa rate fin a n c ia l sta te m e n ts (re vised) The rules for consolidated financial statements are replaced by the new IFRS

 changes are not expected to have a significant impact on the separate financial statements.
IAS 32-- F in a n cia l in stru m e n ts: p re s e n ta tio n (am e n d m e n t) The amendments clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial

 of the new IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, IAS 28 has been renamed, and the standard now describes the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates. The change is effective for annual periods beginning 1

 January 2014 or later. It is not expected that the change will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 9 F in a n c ia l In stru m e n ts IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets

 and financial liabilities and replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The new standard requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured

<<<

 at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition, and depends on the entity's business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial

<<<

 assets. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2015 or later. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The group has not fully

for significant changes in the capitalised value of assets and liabilities during the coming fiscal year are discussed below.
a) E s tim a te d d e c lin e in va lue o f in ta n g

<<<

 ib le a sse ts a n d p ro p e rty, p la n t a n d e q u ip m e n t (PPE)
The group performs periodic tests to assess whether there has been a decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE. These are written down to their recoverable amount

<<<

 when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount from assets or cash-generating units is determined by calculating the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is

<<<

 the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates.
The group's cash-generating units are Europe newsprint, Australasia newsprint, Norske

<<<

 Skog Pisa (Brazil) newsprint, Norske Skog Singburi (Thailand) newsprint, Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) and Norske Skog Saugbrugs (Norway) magazine paper (super-calendered (SC)). The cash-generating unit Europe newsprint

<<<

 consists of Norske Skog Golbey (France), Norske Skog Bruck Paper Machine 3 (Austria) and Norske Skog Skogn (Norway). The cash-generating unit Australasia newsprint consists of Norske Skog Albury (Australia), Norske Skog Boyer (Australia) and

<<<

 Norske Skog Tasman (New Zealand). The cash-generating unit Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) consists of Norske Skog Walsum (Germany) and Norske Skog Bruck Paper Machine 4 (Austria). In cases where several mills are part of

<<<

 a cash-generating unit, this is because production can be moved between the mills, based on what gives best profitability for the group as a whole.
The capitalised value of intangible assets and PPE within the cash-generating units is measured

<<<

 against the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within these units. A possible future change in the composition of the group's cash-generating units could lead to changes in the value in use within these cash-generating units, which could

<<<

 in turn mean a future decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
Calculating the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within the cash-generating units is based on estimated discounted cash flows. The cash flow horizon in the impairment

<<<

 model is consistent with the useful life of each paper machine in the group. The board-approved operating plan for the next year forms the basis for calculating expected future cash flows. In the impairment testing, sales prices are assumed

<<<

 to exhibit a decline in real terms and variable costs are assumed to decline in real terms, with lower demand for input factors due to a shrinking industry.
The estimation of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development

<<<

 of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty when it comes to the outcome of the calculations. Norske Skog performs sensitivity

<<<

 analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations will impact recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive

<<<

 to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate used. Changes in these factors will have the effect of altering the value of cash flows and thereby also the value in use within the cash-generating units. Significant

<<<

 changes in prognoses and long-term prices could accordingly mean a future fall in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
The required rate of return applied when discounting future cash flows is crucial for the calculated value of intangible

<<<

 assets and PPE. A future increase in the required rate of return when discounting future cash flows will reduce value in use and could in turn mean a future decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE.

, physical wear and tear, as well as technical and commercial development. Assessment of future developments in demand in the markets Norske Skog's products are sold is central to the assessment of the economic life of the group's mills. Expected

<<<

 future dem and, together with the competitiveness of Norske Skog's mills, is crucial for the determination of economic life. In addition, legal or other restrictions relating to usage could affect the economic life of the mills in the group

<<<

.
c) P ro visio n fo r future e n viro n m e n ta l o b lig a tio n s
The group's provision for future environmental obligations is based on a number of assumptions made using m anagem ent's best judgment. Changes in any of these assumptions

<<<

 could have an impact on the group's provision and group costs. See Note 21 for further information.
d) R e s id u a l va lue a n d d is m a n tlin g p ro v is io n
The residual value of the group's production equipment is valued as the anticipated

<<<

 realisable value on the balance sheet date, after deducting the estimated costs relating to asset dismantling, removal and restoration. If the estimated costs exceed the estimated residual values, the net liability is added to the fixed asset

<<<

 cost in the balance sheet and a provision is recognised as a liability. The group performs a review of the residual value of its production equipment at the end of each accounting year. Residual value is affected by short-term changes in the

<<<

 underlying assumptions, for example scrap metal prices. A change in the residual value could have an impact on future depreciation costs. The provision for dismantling costs is based on a number of assumptions made using m anagem ent's best

<<<

 judgment. See Note 21 for further information.
e) F a ir value o f d e riva tive s a n d o th e r fin a n c ia l in s tru m e n ts
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation

<<<

 techniques. The group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. See Note 9 for more information.
f) P e n s io n s
The present value

<<<

 of the pension obligation depends on several input factors that are determined by means of a number of actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the net pension expense (income) include the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions

<<<

 will affect the carrying value of the pension obligation.
3. OPERATING SEGMENTS
Reportable segments
The group is divided into two operating segments: newsprint and magazine paper. The segment selection is based on the products manufactured

<<<

 and on the organisational structure used in the group's internal performance measurement and resource allocation. The newsprint segment is further divided into two geographical regions, newsprint Europe and newsprint outside Europe. The composition

<<<

 of Norske Skog's operating segments was changed with effect from 1 January 2012. Activities relating to energy, which were previously included in a separate segment, are now included within other activities. This is because there is no longer

<<<

 a central unit within the group for monitoring and controlling activities related to energy. The group still has operating revenue and operating expenses relating to energy, but the bulk of the revenue is from units within the group. The activities

<<<

 related to energy therefore have little importance for Norske Skog's ongoing operations. The comparative figures for 2011 have been restated in accordance with the new segment structure.
At the end of 2012, Norske Skog had 11 fully or partly

<<<

 owned paper mills on four continents. Two of the mills produce only magazine paper, one produces both magazine paper and newsprint and eight produce newsprint only. Both the newsprint and the magazine paper segment represent an aggregation

<<<

 of the paper machines in the group producing the two paper qualities.

 production and sale of standard newsprint and other paper qualities used in newspapers, inserts, catalogs, etc. These paper qualities, measured in grammes per square meter, will normally be in the range 40-57 g/m2.

M agazine p a p e r
The

<<<

 magazine paper segment encompasses production and sale of the paper qualities super calendered (SC), machine finished coated (MFC) and light weight coated (LWC). These paper qualities are used in magazines, periodicals, catalogs and brochures

.

O th e r activitie s
Activities in the group that do not fall into the operating segments newsprint or magazine paper are presented under other activities. This includes purchase and resale of energy to the group's mills, corporate functions

<<<

, real estate activities, trading and sorting of recovered paper and purchase and resale of wood.

Revenues and expenses not allocated to operating segments
Norske Skog manages non-current debt, taxes and cash positions on a group basis. Consequently

<<<

, financial items and tax expenses are presented only for the group as a whole.
The group's investment in associated companies accounted for in accordance with the equity method is primarily related to its 33.7% share in Malaysian Newsprint

<<<

 Industries Sdn. Bhd., which is described in more detail in Note 20 Investments in associated companies.

Major customers
Norske Skog had a total sales volume of newsprint and magazine paper of 3 588 000 tonnes in 2012, of which sales to the

<<<

 group's largest customer constituted approximately 401 000 tonnes.

Disposals in 2012 were primarily related to the divestments

<<<

 of Papeles Norske Skog Bio Bio S.A. in Chile, Norske Skog Follum AS in Norway, Norske Skog Parenco B.V. in the Netherlands and the global recovered paper business, Reparco. Disposals in 2011 were primarily related to the sale of Norske Skog

<<<

 Florestal Ltda. in Brazil and scrapping of fully depreciated assets that no longer have any technical value.
Non-current assets held for sale
Norske Skog did not have any non-current assets held for sale per 31 Decem ber 2012.
Assumptions applied

<<<

 when calculating the recoverable amount
PPE and intangible non-current assets are written down to their recoverable amount when this is lower than the carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is

<<<

 the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from an asset or cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies the value in use approach when calculating

<<<

 recoverable amount for its cash-generating units.
When calculating value in use, the group is divided into the following cash-generating units: Europe newsprint, Australasia newsprint, Norske Skog Pisa (Brazil) newsprint, Norske Skog Singburi

<<<

 (Thailand) newsprint, Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) and Norske Skog Saugbrugs (Norway) magazine paper (super-calendered (SC)). The cash-generating unit Europe newsprint consists of Norske Skog Golbey (France), Norske Skog

<<<

 Bruck Paper Machine 3 (Austria) and Norske Skog Skogn (Norway). The cash-generating unit Australasia newsprint consists of Norske Skog Albury (Australia), Norske Skog Boyer (Australia) and Norske Skog Tasman (New Zealand). The cash-generating

<<<

 unit Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) consists of Norske Skog Walsum (Germany) and Norske Skog Bruck Paper Machine 4 (Austria). In cases where several mills are part of a cash-generating unit, this is because production can

<<<

 be moved between the mills, based on what gives best profitability for the group as a whole.
Norske Skog has made some changes with respect to how value in use is calculated in the impairment testing performed at 31 Decem ber 2012. From the

<<<

 fourth quarter of 2012, the adjusted present value model (APV) for calculating the present value of future cash flows has been replaced by a weighted average cost of capital model (Wa CC).
Nominal cash flow is estimated in the currency in which

<<<

 it will be generated. The value is calculated by discounting based on a required rate of return on capital that is relevant for the cash-generating unit or the individual asset. The required rate of return is based on the interest rate on ten

<<<

 year government bonds in the currency of the cash flow estimate, an industry debt yield premium, industry beta and an equity risk premium. In certain instances, a country-specific risk premium relevant to the cash-generating unit or individual

<<<

 asset has been added.
When calculating value in use at the end of 2012, the discount rate after tax was in the interval from 6.3% to 14.6% (8.6% to 12.4% in 2011, but then calculated as adjusted present value (APV) and hence not directly comparable

<<<

). The calculations are based on cash flow and the required rate of return after tax. The applied discount rate for Europe newsprint was in the interval from 6.9% to 7.1%, Australasia newsprint was in the interval from 7.9% to 8.3%, Norske Skog

<<<

 Pisa (Brazil) newsprint was 14.6%, Norske Skog Singburi (Thailand) newsprint was 10.1%, Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)) was in the interval from 6.3% to 6.9% and Norske Skog Saugbrugs (Norway) magazine paper (super-calendered

<<<

 (SC)) was 7.1%.
F-179

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPM ENT (Continued)
Cash flow is calculated individually for each business unit, based

<<<

 on the estimated useful life. The paper industry is a capital intensive industry where investment decisions are made based on projects with a long time horizon. The production machines have a long technical life. The estimated remaining useful

<<<

 life of the individual paper machines forms the basis for determining the length of the cash flow period. For both sales prices and input prices, a continued decline in real terms is expected, as historically observed. In the impairment testing

<<<

 at 31 Decem ber 2012, real term sales prices are assumed to decline by approximately 10% during the next ten year period, while sales volumes are expected to develop in accordance with the useful lives of the different paper machines in the

<<<

 group. Projection of these assumptions will result in a gradual improvement in margins, from levels at the bottom of the business cycle to a normalisation with return to trend economic growth. The impairment testing at 31 Decem ber 2012 was

<<<

 based on the operating plan for the group for 2013 as approved by the board of directors.
The cash flow decreases gradually over time as the capacity of the group declines, reflecting assumed closures of machines as they reach the end of their

<<<

 useful lives.

Sensitivity to estimates of recoverable amount
The estimation of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes

<<<

, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty when it comes to the outcome of these calculations. Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations

<<<

 will impact recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate

<<<

 used. A reduction in sales price and sales volumes for the whole group in the cash flow period of 5% will cause a reduction in recoverable amount in the order of NOK 4 800 million and NOK 1 700 million respectively. Correspondingly, a 1% increase

<<<

 in the discount rate will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 800 million. An appreciation of NOK of 1% against all other functional currencies in the Norske Skog group will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK

<<<

 300 million.

Im pairm ent losses recognised in 2012
Norske Skog assessed the recoverable amount at each quarter-end during 2012. Total impairments recognised in 2012 amounted to NOK 2 086 million. These impairments consisted of NOK 1 338 million

<<<

 in the operating segment newsprint outside Europe, NOK 694 million in the operating segment magazine paper and NOK 54 in other activities. The impairments arose mainly as a result of lower sales price expectations and reduced cash flow horizon

<<<

.

Expected useful life
Norske Skog has conducted

<<<

 sensitivity analyses with respect to changes in expected useful life of the group's paper machines. If the expected useful life of all the group's paper machines is reduced by one year, the annual depreciation charge will increase by around

<<<

 NOK 150 million.
In connection with the year-end closing process for 2012, Norske Skog performed a review of the expected remaining useful lives of PPE. The outcome of the review was that the lifetimes of some of the group's paper machines

<<<

 were reduced with effect from 1 January 2013. The reduced useful lives were reflected in the cash flow horizon, resulting in impairments in the operating segments newsprint and magazine paper. Due to impairment losses recognised in 2012, the

8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCO UNTING
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
Norske Skog is exposed to various financial risk factors through the group's operating activities, including market risk (interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity risk

<<<

), liquidity risk and credit risk. Norske Skog seeks to minimise losses and volatility on the group's earnings caused by adverse market movements. Moreover, Norske Skog monitors and manages financial risk based on internal policies and standards

<<<

 set forth by corporate management and approved by the board of directors. These written policies provide principles for the overall risk management as well as standards for managing currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity

<<<

 risk and the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and standards is continuously monitored. There were no breaches of these policies during 2012 or 2011.

M arket Risk
a) Interest rate

<<<

 risk
The goal of interest rate risk management is to secure the lowest possible interest rate payments over time within acceptable risk limits. In the current challenging situation in the publication paper market, Norske Skog has secured most

In te re s t rate s e n s itiv ity analysis
In accordance with IFRS 7 F in a n c ia l in s

<<<

 tru m e n ts -- d is c lo s u r e s , an interest rate sensitivity analysis is presented showing the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest costs and interest income, as well as equity where applicable. The analysis is based

<<<

 on the following assumptions:
 Floating rate debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates, i.e. the interest costs or interest income associated with such instruments will fluctuate based on changes in market rates. These changes are

<<<

 accounted for in the sensitivity analysis. The result is based on the assumption that all other factors are kept constant.
 Changes in market rates on fixed rate debt will only affect the income statement if they are measured at fair value

<<<

. Thus, fixed rate instruments recognised at amortised cost will not represent an interest rate risk as defined by IFRS 7. Such instruments will therefore not have any influence on the sensitivity analysis.
 Change in fair value of interest

<<<

 rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedge on the group's fixed rate bonds will not influence the sensitivity calculation of either the income statement or equity. As a result of fair value hedge accounting, the changes in fair value

<<<

 of interest rate swaps recognised in the income statement are, to a large extent, offset by opposite changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item. Potential ineffectiveness stemming from retrospective effectiveness testing of the hedging

<<<

 relationship is regarded as insignificant to this analysis.
 Changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives that are not designated as a fair value hedge of the group's liabilities, and which are subsequently measured at fair value through

<<<

 profit or loss, are taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis.
 Currency derivatives will only affect the sensitivity analysis to a very limited extent upon changes in the discount rate.
 Results are presented net of tax, using

<<<

 the Norwegian statutory tax rate of 28%.
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on a parallel shift in the yield curve for each relevant currency to which Norske Skog is exposed. Following a 50 basis point downward/upward parallel

<<<

 shift in the yield curve in all interest rate markets to which Norske Skog is exposed, net earnings would have been NOK 3 million higher/lower at 31 Decem ber 2012 (NOK 2 million lower/higher at 31 Decem ber 2011). Change in net interest payments

<<<

 accounts for n Ok 1 million, and the total change in market values of derivatives carried at fair value through profit or loss accounts for NOK 2 million. Floating rate debt has decreased in 2012 due to repayments.
b) Currency risk
T ransaction

<<<

 risk-- c a sh flo w h e d g e
The group has revenues and expenses in various currencies. The major currencies are NOK, EUR, USD, GBP! AUD and NZD. Transaction risk arises because the group has a different currency split on income and expenses

<<<

. Norske Skog calculates a 12-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling basis. The result of the hedging is included in Financial items in the income statement. Norske Skog does not use hedge accounting for the rolling cash

<<<

 flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a gain of NOK 149 million in 2012 (loss of NOK 13 million in 2011). Over time, currency losses or earnings are expected to offset increased or reduced future gross operating earnings.
T ranslation

<<<

 ris k -- n e t in v e s tm e n t h e d g e
The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK. Currency translation risk arises when the financial statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies, are translated into NOK.

 In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition to traditional

 ACCO UNTING (Continued)
debt instruments, all combined currency and interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are also used for hedging net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Norske Skog's net investment hedging is carried out in

<<<

 accordance with IAS 39. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity and offset by translation differences from assets in subsidiaries. The gain or loss related to the ineffective

<<<

 portion is immediately recognised in the income statement. There was no ineffectiveness related to net investment hedge in 2012 or 2011. The effective portion recognised in equity was a gain of NOK 2 million in 2012 (gain of NOK 19 million

<<<

 in 2011). The portion of the debt portfolio to which hedge accounting does not apply was somewhat smaller in 2012 than in 2011. Hedge accounting of USD loans was stopped in the first quarter of 2012 due to the divestment of Papeles Norske Skog

 Bio Bio S.A. in Chile and change of functional currency from USD to BRL for Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil. Foreign exchange gains and losses from such liabilities are recognised in the income statement under Financial items. Cumulative currency

The following foreign exchange sensitivity analysis calculates the sensitivity of derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments on net profit

<<<

 and equity, based on a defined appreciation/ depreciation of NOK against relevant currencies, keeping all other variables constant. The analysis is based on several assumptions, including:
 Norske Skog as a group comprises entities with different

<<<

 functional currencies. Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments of a monetary nature, denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity, create foreign exchange rate exposure on the consolidated income

<<<

 statement. Moreover, foreign currency risk will also affect equity.
 Financial instruments denominated in the functional currency of the entity have no currency risk and will therefore not be applicable to this analysis. Furthermore, the foreign

<<<

 currency exposure of translating financial accounts of subsidiaries into the group's presentational currency is not part of this analysis.
 Sensitivity on commodity contracts and embedded derivatives is presented separately under ``Commodity

<<<

 risk''.
 Currency derivatives and foreign currency debt that are designated as net investment hedges and qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39 will only affect equity.
 Other currency derivatives that are recognised at fair value

<<<

 through profit and loss will affect the income statement. These effects come mainly from currency derivatives designated as hedging of the group's 12-month rolling cash flow exposure, and financial liabilities managed as economic net investment

<<<

 hedges which do not qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39.

F-186

NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCO UNTING (Continued)
 Other non-derivative financial

<<<

 instruments accounted for in the analysis comprise cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accounts receivable and borrowings denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity.
 Correlation effects between

<<<

 currencies are not taken into account. Figures are presented net of tax.
At 31 Decem ber 2012, if NOK had appreciated 10% against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would

<<<

 have been NOK 292 million higher (NOK 464 million higher at 31 Decem ber 2011). If NOK had depreciated by 10% at 31 Decem ber 2012 against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments

<<<

 would have been NOK 292 million lower (NOK 503 million lower at 31 Decem ber 2011). Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner due to changes in the fair value of options. The effect of the sensitivity analysis on the income statement

<<<

 is mainly caused by changes in fair value of derivatives designated as rolling cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange gains/losses on the translation of EUR and USD denominated debt for which there is no hedge accounting. Due to the fact that

<<<

 the portion of debt has decreased in relation to the portion of cash, the effect on the income statement is lower in 2012 compared to 2011. Given a 10% appreciation/depreciation of NOK, equity would have been NOK 180 million higher/lower (NOK

<<<

 378 million higher/lower at 31 Decem ber 2011) as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. The sensitivity analysis on equity excludes the effects from the sensitivity analysis

<<<

 on the income statement, calculated above.
c) Com m odity risk
A major part of Norske Skog's global commodity dem and is secured through long-term contracts. Norske Skog only uses financial instruments to a limited extent to hedge these contracts

<<<

. The hedging ratio represents a trade-off between risk exposure and the opportunity to take advantage of short-term price drops in the spot market. Hedging levels are regulated through mandates approved by the board of directors.
Some of Norske

<<<

 Skog's purchase and sales contracts are defined as financial instruments, or contain em bedded derivatives, which fall within the scope of IAS 39. These financial instruments and em bedded derivatives are measured in the balance sheet at fair

<<<

 value with value changes recognised through profit or loss. Commodity contracts are either financial contracts for the purpose of trading or hedging, or physical commodity contracts that are not for the purpose of own use. The em bedded derivatives

<<<

 are common in physical commodity contracts and comprise a wide variety of derivative characteristics.
Changes in fair value of commodity contracts reflect unrealised gains or losses and are calculated as the difference between market price

<<<

 and contract price, discounted to present value. Some commodity contracts are bilateral contracts or em bedded derivatives in bilateral contracts, for which there exists no active market. Hence, valuation techniques, with the use of available

<<<

 market information, are used as much as possible. Techniques that reflect how the market could be expected to price instruments are used in non-observable markets.
Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists mostly of physical energy

<<<

 contracts. Fair value of commodity contracts is therefore especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of em bedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations. In March 201

<<<

2, Norske Skog sold long-term excess energy in Norway for NOK 170 million and in May 2011, Norske Skog sold the energy com pany Enerpar-Energias do Parana Ltda. in Brazil for NOK 410 million.

Liquidity risk
Norske Skog is exposed to liquidity risk in a scenario when the group's cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to cover payments of

<<<

 financial liabilities. In order to effectively mitigate liquidity risk, Norske Skog's liquidity risk managem ent strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient cash, as well as securing available financing through committed credit facilities. Managing

<<<

 liquidity risk is centralised on a group level.
In order to uncover future liquidity risk, Norske Skog forecasts both short- and long-term cash flows. Cash flow forecasts include cash flows stemming from operations, investments, financing activities

<<<

 and financial instruments. The group had current investments, cash and cash equivalents of NOK 1 194 million at 31 Decem ber 2012 (NOK 1 200 million at 31 Decem ber 2011) and an undrawn credit facility of NOK 1 028 million at 31 Decem ber 

<<<

2012 (fully drawn credit facilities of NOK 1 086 million at 31 Decem ber 2011). See Note 11 for more information regarding the maturity of facilities. Restricted bank deposits amounted to NOK 211 million at 31 Decem ber 2012 (NOK 172 million

 at 31 Decem ber 2011).
The following table shows the contractual maturities of non-derivative financial liabilities and other derivative financial instruments. All amounts disclosed in the table are undiscounted cash flows. Furthermore, amounts

)
The fair value of derivatives that are not traded in an active market (over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using various valuation techniques. Interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forward rate agreements and foreign currency

<<<

 forward contracts are all valued by estimating the present value of future cash flows. Currency options are valued using recognised option pricing models. Quoted cash and swap rates are used as input for calculating zero coupon curves used

<<<

 for discounting. The exchange rates used are the quoted closing rates at 31 December.
The fair value of commodity contracts recognised in the balance sheet is calculated by using quotes from actively traded markets when available. Otherwise

<<<

, price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used. Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 are recognised in the balance sheet and valued on the same principle as financial contracts. Some of

<<<

 these are long-term energy contracts. In calculating the fair value of em bedded derivatives, valuation techniques are used in the absence of observable market inputs. Em bedded currency options are calculated using a Black 76 valuation model

<<<

, where some input assumptions have been made in absence of an active long-term option market.
The following table is presented in accordance with IFRS 7.27, showing the fair value of commodity contracts in level 3 given a change in assumptions

<<<

 to a reasonably possible alternative.

Total debt listed in the repayment schedule may differ from booked debt. This is due to premiums or discounts on issued bonds, hedge reserves and fair value hedging. At 31 Decem ber 2

012, the financial statements included a discount of NOK 57 million (discount of NOK 91 million at 31 Decem ber 2011). Premiums or discounts on issued bonds are amortised in the income statement over the lifetime of the issued bonds. See Note

 6 for loans secured by mortgage.

As a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the beginning of 2009, an amount was reclassified in the balance sheet. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK

<<<

 196 million was included in interest-bearing debt as at 31 Decem ber 2012 (NOK 270 million at 31 Decem ber 2011). The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over

<<<

 the term of the debt that has been hedged.

Total interest-bearing debt is impacted by unrealised currency effects on forward contracts and on cross currency swap contracts. This will also differ from booked debt. At 31 Decem ber 2012, this

<<<

 effect decreased debt by NOK 132 million (debt was decreased by NOK 84 million at 31 Decem ber 2011).
At 31 Decem ber 2012, the group's holding of own bonds amounted to NOK 163 million of Norwegian bonds (NOK 361 million at 31 Decem ber 20

11). The group's holding of own bonds in foreign currency amounted to USD 42 million and EUR 132 million, respectively (USD 29 million and EUR 63 million at 31 Decem ber 2011). These holdings are deducted from interest-bearing debt in NOK.

Long-term incentive program me
The board of directors adopted new principles for the long-term incentive

 a defined group of paper manufacturers, including Norske Skog. A positive TSR for the period is also an absolute condition. This scheme will yield a 30% payout if Norske Skog performs better than the average for the reference group and a full

<<<

 payout if the com pany falls within the best quartile. Progress is measured over a three-year period, with a new period beginning each year. This scheme involves no dilution effect.
The programme was continued for 2010 with some changes: the

<<<

 maximum annual bonus from the programme was set to NOK 4 million for the CEO and NOK 2 million for other members of corporate managem ent (instead of a fixed number of shares), and the bonus after tax must be used to purchase shares until the

The discount rate applied for the pension schemes in Norway for 2012 is based on the interest rate for covered bonds, and not the interest rate for

<<<

 government bonds as used previously. The impact of this change is an increase in the discount rate, since the interest rate for covered bonds is higher than the interest rate on government bonds.

Subsidiaries can deviate from these assumptions

<<<

 if local conditions require this. The discount rates applied vary from 2.5% to 4.5% . For Norske Skog Walsum Gm bH, the discount rate used is 4.5%.

. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
Restructuring expenses of NOK 118 million in 2012 consisted mainly of severance payments of NOK 105 million as a result of the decision to permanently close 160 000 tonnes of newsprint capacity at Norske Skog Tasman

<<<

 in New Zealand. Other restructuring expenses included NOK 17 million in relation to severance payments and other costs as a result of the ongoing downsizing at head office and changes in corporate management, NOK 8 million in relation to redundancies

<<<

 at Norske Skog Golbey in France, NOK 11 million related to severance payments and other costs following the closure of Norske Skog's shared service centre located in Antwerp in Belgium, and NOK 4 million related to planned redundancies at Norske

<<<

 Skog Skogn. These amounts were offset by the recognition of NOK 24 million income due to the release of provisions expensed in 2011 at Norske Skog Walsum (NOK 21 million) and Norske Skog Bruck (NOK 3 million), as a result of more employees

<<<

 working during the notice period than anticipated.
Restructuring expenses of NOK 387 million in 2011 consisted mainly of NOK 287 million relating to provisions for severance pay and other payroll-related costs (NOK 115 million), and direct

<<<

 closure costs (NOK 172 million) following the decision to shut down the paper production at Norske Skog Follum. Other restructuring expenses recognised in 2011 consisted of NOK 59 million in relation to provisions for severance pay in connection

<<<

 with a cost reduction programme at Norske Skog Walsum, NOK 26 million in relation to the implementation of the new group operating model in May 2011, severance pay and other costs of NOK 13 million at Norske Skog Logistics in Antwerp, NOK 

<<<

3 million at Norske Skog Focus and NOK 10 million at the head office at Lysaker. There were also some smaller adjustments to restructuring provisions made in earlier periods.

(1) Long-term commodity contracts that no longer meet the requirement in IAS 39.5 related to own use are measured at fair value.
The gain on divestments of business activities

, property, plant and equipment in 2012 of NOK 39 million was primarily related to the divestments of Papeles Norske Skog Bio Bio S.A. in Chile, Norske Skog Follum AS in Norway, Norske Skog Parenco B.V, in the Netherlands and the global recovered

 paper business, Reparco (in total NOK 38 million). The remaining amount was mainly related to the sale of non-production related property.
Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists mostly of physical energy contracts. The fair

<<<

 value of commodity contracts is therefore especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of em bedded derivatives in physical contracts is influenced by currency and price index fluctuations. Note 8 provides a sensitivity

<<<

 analysis of the impact on profit after tax of fluctuations in energy prices, currency and price indices. The loss on commodity contracts in 2012 and 2011 was due to lower expected future energy prices, and volumes utilised during 2012 and 

<<<

2011. The gain on em bedded derivatives in 2012 and 2011 was mainly driven by currency fluctuations.
Other realised gains and losses of NOK - 1 5 2 million in 2012 were primarily related to the sale of 680 GWh of excess energy in Southern Norway

<<<

. The sale generated a loss of NOK 153 million.
The gain on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment in 2011 of NOK 354 million was primarily related to the sale of Norske Skog Florestal Ltda. and Enerpar-Energias do

The group has significant tax losses in several jurisdictions. These losses are included as a deferred tax asset to the extent it is expected that sufficient earnings will be earned within the time limitations

<<<

 applicable in the various jurisdictions. The table above summarises from which geographical areas the losses arose, as well as the portion of the losses that are not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
(1) In 2012, the amount was related to

<<<

 tax exemption on the divestment of subsidiaries in Norway (Norske Skog Follum AS), Chile (Norske Skog Bio Bio S.A.) and the Netherlands (Norske Skog Parenco B.V.). In 2011, the amount was related to tax on the divestment of subsidiaries in

<<<

 Brazil (Enerpar-Energias do Parana Ltda. and Norske Skog Florestal Ltda.).
(2) Deferred tax asset not recognised amounted to NOK 3 065 million at 31 December 2012. NOK 2 746 million was related to tax losses to carry forward and NOK 319 million

<<<

 was related to other deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax asset not recognised amounted to NOK 1 198 million at 31 December 2011. NOK 937 million was related to tax losses carried forward, and NOK 261 million was related to other

<<<

 tax deductible temporary differences.
(3) In 2012, an amount of NOK 5 956 million was added to tax losses to carry forward in Norway. This was a result of tax deductible losses that arose following a legal restructuring of the company structure

<<<

. Deferred tax asset is not recognised on the amount.

 Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd. (MNI)
The company is incorporated in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and is a producer of newsprint. During 2012, MNI derecognised some assets in their financial statements, relating to property, plant and equipment that

<<<

 was no longer in use. Norske Skog's share of this derecognition was recognised in the consolidated financial statements in 2012, and amounted to NOK 183 million. Following this, Norske Skog was also able to reverse impairments previously recognised

<<<

 of NOK 94 million. The effect of the derecognition and reversal of previous impairments is presented net in the income statement, and is included in the line Share of profit in associated companies. The carrying value of Norske Skog's investment

<<<

 in MNI was NOK 311 million at 31 Decem ber 2012, which is equivalent to Norske Skog's share (33.7%) of the equity (including redeemable preference shares and share premium) in M N I's com pany financial statements. Based on the com pany's financial

<<<

 statements, operating revenue in 2012 was NOK 991 million (NOK 1 015 million in 2011) and net profit was NOK 59 million (NOK 16 million in 2011). Total assets amounted to NOK 1 570 million at 31 D ecem ber 2012 (NOK 2 314 million at 31 Decem

Restructuring provision
The restructuring provision of NOK 140 million at 31 D ecem ber 2012 is classified in the balance sheet line Other current liabilities. A provision of NOK 136 million was released through the divestment

<<<

 of Norske Skog Follum AS in 2012. During 2012, it was decided to shut down one paper machine at Norske Skog Tasman, and a provision of NOK 86 million was recognised. Various other restructuring activities, mainly in Europe, amounted to NOK

<<<

 13 million. Total cash flow relating to restructuring activities in 2012 amounted to NOK 182 million. This amount related mainly to Norske Skog Follum and Norske Skog Tasman. For further information see Note 16 Restructuring expenses.

Dism

<<<

 antling provision
Provisions related to future dismantling costs arising from a future closing down of production facilities amounted to NOK 92 million at 31 Decem ber 2012, compared to NOK 102 million at 31 Decem ber 2011. The total amount

<<<

 is classified as non-current and will only be realised at the time of a future shut down of any of the Norske Skog production units. The provision is the net present value of the future estimated costs, calculated using a long-term risk-free

<<<

 interest rate. The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement line Financial items. The opposite entry for dismantling provision and change in provision estimates is Property, plant and equipment.

 SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21. PROVISIONS (Continued)
Discount rates and assumptions included as part of the best estimate will impact the future carrying value of the dismantling provision

<<<

. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction in the future discount rate of one percentage point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 9 million, with a corresponding increase in future depreciation on property, plant and equipment

<<<

.

Environmental provision
The group's provision for environmental obligations is presented in the balance sheet as Other non-current liabilities. The provision is related to estimated future costs for cleaning up any environmental pollution

<<<

 caused by Norske Skog production units. The provision will mainly be realised in a future period upon a potential shut down of the production activities of any of the Norske Skog production units. Increased environmental requirements from local

<<<

 governments may also lead to realisation of this provision at an earlier point in time.
Provisions for future environmental obligations amounted to NOK 250 million at 31 Decem ber 2012 compared to NOK 283 at 31 Decem ber 2011. Resources spent

<<<

 on environmental activities during 2012 amounted to NOK 35 million, and were mainly related to activities in Norway, Brazil (Norske Skog Pisa) and New Zealand (Norske Skog Tasman). Other movements arose mainly a result of lower discount rates

<<<

 and currency translation differences.
The carrying value of the provision is the best estimate made by measuring the expected value of the specific obligations, discounted to present value using a long-term risk-free interest rate when the

<<<

 time value of money is material. Changes in factors included in the expected value will impact the carrying value of the obligation. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction in the future discount rate by one percentage point would increase

<<<

 the provision by approximately NOK 24 million. Changes in accounting estimates not related to assets are classified as operating items in the income statement, and the periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised within the income statement

<<<

 line Financial items.

25. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Norske Skog's objective when managing capital is to maximise return on equity within the limits

<<<

 set by the group's external debt financing.
In order to improve the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The group

<<<

 monitors its capital structure on the basis of interest coverage ratio (adjusted EBITDA / net interest expense) and the debt ratio (adjusted net interest-bearing debt / adjusted EBITDA). The group was within the limits for the key figures at

<<<

 31 Decem ber 2012. For more information see Note 11.

26. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Norske Skog is an international com pany that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and contracting

<<<

 parties. At the end of 2012, the group was in dialogues with tax authorities in Norway and Australia regarding previously completed transactions. Norske Skog has an ongoing process related to simplification of the group's corporate structure

<<<

. This, in combination with changes in individual countries' tax laws, could increase the group's tax exposure. The group's assessment is that sufficient provisions have been made for the aforementioned conditions.

 ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 27. RELATED PARTIES All transactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with the arm 's length principle. Some of Norske Skogindustrier ASA's shareholders are forest

<<<

 owners delivering forestry products to the group's production units in Norway. One of the board members, Eilif Due, is a forest owner who supplies wood to the group on normal standardised terms. All contracts for supply of wood are entered

<<<

 into through forest owner associations or companies. The associated company Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd. (MNI) purchased recovered paper from the Reparco companies in the Norske Skog group, prior to the divestment of these companies

<<<

 in October 2012. Total purchases made during 2012 from Reparco amounted to NOK 1 million (NOK 5 million in 2011). Purchases of goods and services by MNI from other companies in the Norske Skog group during 2012 amounted to NOK 1 million (NOK

<<<

 0 million in 2011). There were no amounts payable by MNI to the Norske Skog group at 31 Decem ber 2012 or 31 Decem ber 2011. A former board member, Alexandra Bech Gjrv, is a partner in the law firm Hjort DA. Norske Skogindustrier ASA purchased

<<<

 services amounting to NOK 173 000 from this firm during 2012 (NOK 345 000 during 2011). Bech Gjrv left the board of directors during 2012. None of the board members receive remuneration for their work for the com pany from any source other

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORM ATION Norske Skogindustrier

<<<

 ASA (``the com pany'') and its subsidiaries (together ``the group'') manufacture, distribute and sell publication paper. This includes newsprint and magazine paper. The group has 14 fully and partly owned mills on four continents. Norske Skogindustrier

<<<

 ASA is incorporated in Norway and has its head office at Oxenen outside of Oslo. The com pany is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors in Norske Skogindustrier

<<<

 ASA on 29 February 2012. All amounts are presented in NOK million unless otherwise stated. There may be some small differences in the summation of columns due to rounding.
R eclassification in the balance sheet A review of the balance sheet

<<<

 was carried out during 2011. This resulted in reclassification of certain current asset and liability items. The modified classification has been applied retrospectively, and comparative figures in the balance sheet have been restated. Prepayments

<<<

 to suppliers have been moved from Other current assets to Receivables. The change has an effect of NOK 73 million as at 31 Decem ber 2011 and NOK 88 million as at 31 Decem ber 2010. Accrued financial costs and short-term obligations related

<<<

 to financial instruments are moved from Trade and other payables to Other current liabilities. The change has an effect of NOK 216 million as at 31 Decem ber 2011 and NOK 332 million as at 31 Decem ber 2010. Accrued expenses and provisions

<<<

 for goods received but not invoiced are reclassified from Other current liabilities to Trade and other payables. The change has an effect of NOK 46 million as at 31 Decem ber 2011 and NOK 103 million as at 31 Decem ber 2010.
2. ACCO UNTING

<<<

 PRINCIPLES The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Norske Skogindustrier ASA are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise

<<<

 stated. The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations from the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as adopted by the European Union (EU). They

<<<

 have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of biological assets, available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
C o n s o lid a tio n
a) S u b sid

<<<

 ia rie s Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. The group also assesses whether control exists

<<<

 where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power, but is able to govern the financial and operating policies by virtue of de-facto control. An important factor when assessing de-facto control is whether or not the group can choose the

<<<

 board of directors. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date at which control is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from the date on which such control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses

<<<

 on transactions are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been am ended where necessary to ensure consistency

<<<

 with the policies adopted by the group.
F-221

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
b) C ha ng e in o w n e rsh ip interests in s u b s id ia rie s w ith o u t lo

<<<

 ss o f c o n tro l
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Upon further acquisition of shares in subsidiaries from non-controlling interests, the difference

<<<

 between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary, is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity

<<<

.
c) D isp o sa l o f su bsid ia rie s
W hen the group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial

<<<

 carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity

<<<

 are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
d) A ssociates

<<<


Associates are all entities over which the group exercises significant influence but not control, generally held to accom pany a shareholding of 20% to 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method

<<<

 of accounting. The investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition.
The group's share of post

<<<

 acquisition profits or losses made by its associates is recognised as Share of profit in associated companies and is assigned to the carrying value of the investment, together with the group's share of comprehensive income in the associated

<<<

 company. When the group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments

<<<

 on behalf of the associate.
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and its associates are recognised in the group financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the associates.
The group

<<<

 determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount

<<<

 of the associate and its carrying value, and recognises the amount as Share of profit in associated companies.
Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement. If the ownership interest

<<<

 in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
Segm ent reporting
R ep orta

<<<

 ble se g m e n ts
The activities in the group are divided into three operating segments: newsprint, magazine paper and energy. The newsprint segment is further segregated into two geographical regions. The operating segments are reported in

<<<

 a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified

<<<

 as the corporate managem ent team which makes strategic decisions.
F-222

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued) A c c o u n tin g p o lic ie s a p p lie d in the

<<<

 s e g m e n t re p o rtin g Recognition, measurement and classification applied in the segment reporting are consistent with the accounting principles applied for the group's consolidated income statement and balance sheet. The option in IFRS

<<<

 8 allowing different accounting policies to be applied in segment reporting and group reporting is, for transparency reasons, not applied in Norske Skog.
P erform ance m easurem ent The group assesses the performance of the operating segments

<<<

 based on a measure of gross operating earnings (adjusted EBITDA) and gross operating earnings after depreciation (adjusted EBIT). These items exclude the effects of expenditure not deem ed to be part of the regular operating activities of the

<<<

 segment, such as restructuring expenses, impairments, gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in fair value of certain energy contracts and biological assets.
In te rc o m p a n y tran sactio n s The revenue reported per

<<<

 operating segment includes both sales to external parties and sales to other segments. Intra-segment sales are eliminated in the group financial statements. All sales transactions between operating segments are carried out at arm 's length

<<<

 prices as if sold or transferred to independent third parties.
Foreign currency translation
a) F u n ctio n a l a n d p re s e n ta tio n a l cu rre n c y Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured

<<<

 using the currency of the primary economic location in which the entity operates (the ``functional currency''). The exception from this is the activities in South America, where USD is the functional currency. The consolidated financial statements

<<<

 are presented in NOK, which is both the functional and presentational currency of the parent company.
b ) T ransactions a n d b a la n ce s Foreign currency transactions are translated into the entity's functional currency at the exchange rate

<<<

 prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange

<<<

 rates, are recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses subject to hedge accounting and relating to currency positions qualifying as net investment hedges and which are hedge accounted, are booked as part of comprehensive income. Exchange

<<<

 differences arising from the settlement of accounts receivable/payable and unrealised gains/ losses on the same positions are recognised in Operating revenue/Cost of materials respectively. Exchange differences arising from the settlement of

<<<

 other items are recognised within Financial items. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement as Financial items.
c ) G rou p co m p an ies The results and

<<<

 financial position of all group entities which have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
i. Assets and liabilities for each of the balance sheets presented

<<<

 are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet,
ii. Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates,
F-223

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued

<<<

)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
iii. All resulting exchange differences are booked to comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment

<<<

 in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are booked as part of comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves. When a foreign operation is fully or partially

<<<

 sold, such exchange differences are booked out of comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated

<<<

 as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity, and translated at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipm ent
Land and buildings comprise mainly mills, machinery and office premises. All property, plant and equipment (PPE) is shown at

<<<

 cost less subsequent depreciation and impairments. Cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. The residual value of production equipment is defined as the realisable value after deduction of estimated cost

<<<

 of dismantling and removal of the asset. If the estimated cost exceeds the estimated value, the net liability is added to the cost of the related asset, and a provision is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
Borrowing costs which

<<<

 are directly related to qualifying assets are recognised as part of the acquisition cost for the qualifying asset. Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases

<<<

 of PPE.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the

<<<

 item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated.

<<<

 Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The residual value and useful life of the assets are reviewed and

<<<

 adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals

<<<

 are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount, and included in the income statement line Other gains and losses.
Biological assets
Biological assets are measured upon initial recognition and at the end of each reporting

<<<

 period at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs, unless fair value cannot be reliably measured. A gain or loss arising on initial recognition, and from changes in fair value during a period, is reported in net profit or loss for the

<<<

 period in which it arises. When fair value cannot be reliably estimated, the asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets
a) G o o d w ill
Goodwill represents the excess

<<<

 of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill

<<<

 is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the

<<<

 entity sold.
F-224

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued) Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is

<<<

 m ade to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
b) P atents a n d lice n se s
Patents and licenses have a finite useful life and

<<<

 are recognised at historical cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of patents and licences over their estimated useful lives.
c) C o m p u te r softw are
Acquired

<<<

 computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire the specific software and bring it into use, and amortised over their estimated useful lives. Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised

<<<

 as an expense as they are incurred. Costs which are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group, and which are likely to generate economic benefits exceeding the costs beyond

<<<

 one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the costs of software development personnel and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their

<<<

 estimated useful lives.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation, and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation

<<<

 are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount

<<<

. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable (cash-generating

<<<

 units). At each balance sheet date, the possibility of reversing impairment losses in prior periods is evaluated (except for goodwill).
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified

<<<

 as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Financial

<<<

 assets
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and financial assets available for sale. This classification depends on the purpose

<<<

 for which the investments were acquired. Managem ent determines the classification of an investment at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
a) F in a n c ia l a ssets a t fa ir va lu e th ro u g h p

<<<

 ro fit o r lo ss
This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired principally

<<<

 for the purpose of short-term sale or if so designated by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading

<<<

 or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Non-financial commodity contracts where the relevant commodity is readily convertible to cash, and where the contracts are not for own use, fall within the scope of

<<<

 IAS 39 F in a n c ia l In s tru m e n ts --
F-225

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued) r e c o g n itio n a n d m e a s u r e m e n t. Such contracts are treated

<<<

 as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39. Norske Skog currently has energy contracts in Norway and South America that do not meet the own use criteria according to IAS 39.5. The contracts must therefore be treated as derivatives and are booked

<<<

 to fair value through profit or loss (see also Notes 7, 8 and 9). Commodity contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as current assets, unless they are expected to be realised more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. In

<<<

 that case, they are classified as non-current assets.
b) L oa ns a n d re ce iva b le s Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments which are not quoted in an active market. They are included

 in current assets, except for those maturing later than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in Receivables and Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet

<<<

.
c) A va ila b le -fo r-sa le fin a n c ia l assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives which are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets

<<<

 unless managem ent intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Derivatives and hedging Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently

<<<

 re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates derivatives

<<<

 as either: a) Hedges of the fair value of fixed interest loans (fair value hedge), b) Hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), c) Derivatives at fair value through profit or loss. Upon inception of a transaction

<<<

, the group documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk managem ent objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The group also documents its assessment of whether

<<<

 the derivatives that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. This assessment is documented both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis through the hedging period. Accounting for

<<<

 derivatives follows the intentions underlying the associated contract. At the time a contract is entered into, it is defined as either a hedging or a trading contract. Norske Skog uses hedge accounting for a large amount of its economic hedging

<<<

 portfolio.
a) F air value h e d g e Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as hedging and which are effective, are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the of the hedged asset or liability

<<<

 that are attributable to the hedged risk. The ineffective part of the hedging relationship is booked as an interest cost within Financial items. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying

<<<

 amount of the hedged item for which the effective interest method is used, is amortised over the period to maturity. Hedging instruments that are terminated prior to maturity will be treated in the same way. If the underlying hedged item is

<<<

 realised or repurchased prior to maturity, any associated hedging reserve/amortised cost is recognised in the income statement on a one-to-one basis.

c ) D erivative s a t fa ir va lue o v e

<<<

 r p ro fit o r lo ss Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any of these derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement. The fair value of quoted investments is based

<<<

 on the current market price. If the market for a financial asset is not active, the group applies valuation techniques to establish the fair value. These include the use of recent arm 's length transactions, reference to other instruments which

<<<

 are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analyses defined to reflect the issuer's specific circumstances (see also Note 9).
Shares, bonds, certificates, bills, etc. Shares, bonds and certificates classified as financial assets at

<<<

 fair value through profit or loss are valued at market value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other

<<<

 short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Drawn bank overdrafts are shown as Interest-bearing current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and

<<<

 net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or average purchase price. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production

<<<

 overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables

<<<

 are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest

<<<

 method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when objective evidence exists that the group will be unable to collect the entire amount due in accordance with the original terms of each

<<<

 receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision

<<<

 is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been

<<<

 acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

B o rro w in g s
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference

<<<

 between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowing, using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as

<<<

 transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some

<<<

 or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities, unless the group has

<<<

 an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Interest costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Bond loans
The value of bond loans in

<<<

 the balance sheet is reduced by holdings of Norske Skog bonds. Amounts above or below amortised costs upon re-purchase are recognised in the income statement in the same period the re-purchase occurs.
Current and deferred income tax
The group

<<<

's income tax expense includes current tax based on taxable profit in group companies, change of deferred income taxes for the financial period and adjustments to previous periods. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent

<<<

 that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The tax charge is calculated on the basis of

<<<

 the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the com pany's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on

<<<

 temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their tax bases.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit

<<<

 will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes

<<<

 levied by the same taxation authority and there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current deferred tax liabilities.
Pension obligations, bonus arrangem ents and other employee benefits
a) P e nsio n o b lig

<<<

 a tio n s
Group companies operate various pension schemes. These are generally funded through payments to insurance companies, as determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans

<<<

.
A defined benefit plan is one which defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. A defined contribution plan is a

<<<

 pension plan under which the group makes fixed contributions to a separate entity.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance

<<<

 sheet date less the fair value of plan assets,
F-228

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and

<<<

 unrecognised past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated

<<<

 future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability

<<<

, or alternatively a government bond interest rate if such bonds do not exist.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions in excess of the greater of 10% of the value of plan

<<<

 assets or 10% of the defined benefit obligation are allocated to income over the em ployees' expected average remaining working lives.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless changes to the pension plan are conditional

<<<

 on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the group makes contributions

<<<

 to publicly- or privately-administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made. These contributions are recognised as an employee

<<<

 benefit expense in the period the contribution relates to. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b) S h are -b ase d rem un era tion
The group has

<<<

 a long-term incentive plan where the allocation of synthetic options to members of corporate managem ent is based on the development of the com pany's share price in relation to a defined group of listed paper producers. The programme results

<<<

 in a cash payout if the options are exercised. The fair value of the liability is measured at each balance sheet date and on the settlement date. See also Note 12.
c) B o nu s arrangem ents
The group accrues for bonus arrangements when there

<<<

 exists a contractual obligation, or past practice has created a constructive obligation.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present

<<<

 legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise mainly employee

<<<

 termination payments. Restructuring costs are costs which are not related to the ongoing operations. This includes for example severance (redundancy) payments, early retirement or other arrangements for employees leaving the company, external

<<<

 costs relating to coaching, counselling and assistance finding new jobs, or external costs to lawyers and legal advisors in relation to the de-manning process, and lease termination penalties. Provisions are not recognised for future operating

<<<

 losses.
Salary which is earned while the employee contributes to the ongoing operations is not classified as restructuring costs. This includes for example salary in the notice period when the employee is working during the notice period, or

<<<

 bonuses earned whilst the employee contributes to the normal operations. These are booked as normal salary costs. Costs for projects related to improvements are generally ordinary operating costs.
W here a number of similar obligations exist

<<<

, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the
F-229

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure

<<<

 required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised

<<<

 within Financial items.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivables for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the group's activities. Revenue is shown net of value added

<<<

 tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group. The group's revenue consists almost exclusively of the sale of goods, and the principle for recognition of revenue is the same for newsprint and magazine paper

<<<

.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer. This will depend upon the buyer's delivery terms and will be in the range from the finalisation of the production to

<<<

 delivery of the goods to the buyer.
The group's terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2010, which are the official rules for the interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Cham ber of Commerce. The timing of revenue recognition

<<<

 is largely dependent on these delivery terms. The group's sales are covered by the following main categories of terms:
 ``D'' terms, where the group delivers the goods to the purchaser at the agreed destination, usually the purchaser's premises

<<<

. The point of sale is when the goods are delivered to the purchaser. If the customer is invoiced before delivery of the goods purchased, revenue is only recognised if the customer has taken over a significant part of the gain and loss potential

<<<

 related to those goods.
 ``C '' terms, where the group arranges and pays for the external transport of the goods, but the group no longer bears any responsibility for the goods once they have been handed over to the transporter in accordance

<<<

 with the terms of the contract. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the seller.
 ``F'' terms, where the purchaser arranges and pays for the transport. The point of sale is when the goods are

<<<

 handed over to the transporter contracted by the purchaser.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. This

<<<

 is the interest rate that gives a net present value of the cash flow from the loan that is equal to its carrying value.
Leases
Leases in which the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating

<<<

 leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Leases relating to property and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of

<<<

 ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet to the lower of the fair value of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between

<<<

 finance charge and reduction of the outstanding liability, giving a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The leased property is
F-230

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
depreciated according to the same principles applied for other non-current assets. The corresponding rental obligation, net of finance charges, is included in other long-term payables. If the

<<<

 leasing period is shorter than the economic life of the asset and it is unlikely that the group will purchase the asset at the end of the leasing period, the asset is depreciated over the leasing period.
Government grants
Government grants

<<<

 (except for emission rights, described below) are recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grants on a systematic basis to the costs that they are intended to compensate for. Government grants in the form of compensation

<<<

 for losses which have already been incurred, or in the form of direct financial support which is not directly related to future costs, are recognised as income in the same period as they are awarded.
Government grants related to assets are

<<<

 presented in the balance sheet as deferred income or as a reduction of the cost price of the assets the grant relates to. The grant is then recognised in the income statement either through future periodic income recognition or as a future

<<<

 reduction in the depreciation charge.
Emission Rights
There is no accounting standard or interpretation in IFRS regarding the accounting treatment for emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. Received allowances are recognised

<<<

 in the balance sheet as intangible assets at the market value on the date the rights are granted. The difference between fair value and the nominal amount paid for the rights is recognised in the balance as a government grant (deferred income

<<<

).
Emissions are recognised in the income statement as Cost of materials, and the government grant (deferred revenue) is recognised concurrently with emission costs. Unused credits (deferred income) and used allowances are netted against the

<<<

 carrying amount of intangible asset recognised in the balance sheet, when the individual contracts for emission allowances fall due for settlement.
If the received allowances are sufficient to cover the com pany's emissions, there will be no

<<<

 net cost or net income in gross operating earnings. If it is necessary to acquire additional allowances on the open market, a provision is made based on actual emissions.
If the number of allowances received exceeds actual consumption, the

<<<

 surplus is sold in the market. The gain/loss from the sale is presented as Other gains and losses. Emission rights sold in advance are recognised as income in line with actual consumption.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the

<<<

 com pany's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved in the general meeting.
Important accounting estim ates and assum ptions
The group prepares estimates and

<<<

 makes assumptions for the future. Accounting estimates derived from these will, by definition, seldom accord fully with the final outcome. Estimates and assumptions which represent a substantial risk for significant changes in the capitalised

<<<

 value of assets and liabilities during the coming fiscal year are discussed below.
a) E s tim a te d d e c lin e in va lue o f in ta n g ib le a sse ts a n d p ro p e rty, p la n t a n d e q u ip m e n t (PPE)
The group performs periodic tests

<<<

 to assess whether there has been a decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE. These are written down to their recoverable amount when the recoverable amount is lower than the assets carrying value. The recoverable amount from assets

<<<

 or cash-generating units is determined by calculating the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. Calculation

<<<

 of value in use requires use of estimates.
F-231

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
The group's cash-generating units are Europe newsprint, Europe magazine paper

<<<

 (light weight coated (LWC)), Australasia newsprint, South America newsprint, Norske Skog Saugbrugs magazine paper (super-calendered (SC)), Norske Skog Parenco magazine paper (NorCal), Norske Skog Folium magazine paper and Norske Skog Singburi

<<<

 newsprint. Norske Skog Parenco was included in the cash-generating unit Europe newsprint up to and including the second quarter of 2011. In recent years, production at the mill has gradually been converted from newsprint to magazine paper.

<<<

 For 2011, the bulk of production consisted of magazine paper (NorCal). Since Norske Skog Parenco is the only mill in the group producing this magazine paper quality, it is included as a separate cash-generating unit.
The capitalised value of

<<<

 intangible assets and PPE within the cash-generating units is measured against the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within these units. A possible future change in the composition of the group's cash-generating units could mean changes

<<<

 in the value in use within cash-generating units, which could in turn mean a future decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
Calculating the value in use of intangible assets and PPE within the cash-generating units is based on estimated

<<<

 discounted cash flows. Cash flow is estimated individually for up to ten years for each cash-generating unit based on expected economic life. Sales prices and prices for input factors are based on short-term forecasts in the first two years

<<<

 and long-term price prognoses thereafter. The estimated value of operations exceeding ten years is assessed as a terminal value based on the industry average for Enterprise Value / EBITDA, adjusted for the individual asset's technical state

<<<

 and cash-flow horizon.
The prognosis for long-term prices is an estimated equilibrium price level which the least cost-efficient mills in the industry need in order to survive an economic cycle. Only the capacity necessary to meet market requirements

<<<

 is included in the analysis. For paper prices, this is supported by analysis of the marginal producers' means to survive which is affected by elements of cost as well as the market balance. Budgeted figures and long-term prices that have been

<<<

 applied when determining future cash flows might change. Changes in these factors will have the effect of altering the value of cash flows and thereby also the value in use within the cash-generating units. Significant changes in prognoses

<<<

 and long-term prices could accordingly mean a future fall in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
The required rate of return applied when discounting future cash flows is crucial for the calculated value of intangible assets and PPE. A

<<<

 future increase in the required rate of return when discounting future cash flows will reduce value in use and could in turn mean a future decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE.
b ) A n n u a l a s s e s s m e n t o f th e re m

 a in in g e c o n o m ic life o f P P E
The group conducts annual reviews of the remaining economic life of PPE. An increase or decrease in the remaining economic life will have an impact on future depreciation, as well as affect the cash flow

<<<

 horizon for calculating value in use. Economic life is estimated by considering the expected usage, physical wear and tear, as well as technical and commercial development. Assessment of future developments in demand in the markets Norske Skog

<<<

's products are sold is central to the assessment of the economic life of the group's mills. Expected future dem and, together with the competitiveness of Norske Skog's mills, is crucial for the determination of economic life. In addition, legal

 or other restrictions relating to usage could affect the economic life of the mills in the group.
c) P rovision fo r future e n v iro n m e n ta l o b lig atio n s
The group's provision for future environmental obligations is based on a number

3. OPERATING SEGMENTS Reportable segments The group is divided into three operating segments: newsprint, magazine paper and energy. The segment selection

<<<

 is based on the product and on the organisational structure used in the group's internal performance measurement and resource allocation. The newsprint segment is further divided into two geographical regions. At the end of 2011, Norske Skog

<<<

 had 14 fully or partly owned paper mills on four continents. Two of the mills produce only magazine paper, three produce both magazine paper and newsprint and nine produce newsprint only. Norske Skog Parenco was included within the operating

<<<

 segment for newsprint, up to and including the third quarter of 2011. From the fourth quarter of 2011, the mill is included within the operating segment for magazine paper, since production at the mill has in recent years been gradually converted

<<<

 from newsprint to magazine paper. The bulk of production at the mill is now magazine paper (NorCal). Both the newsprint and the magazine paper segment represent an aggregation of the paper machines in the group producing the two paper qualities

<<<

.
N ew sp rin t
The newsprint segment encompasses production and sale of paper qualities which, measured in grammes per square meter, will normally be in the range 40-57 g/m 2. These paper qualities are for instance used in newspapers, and advertising

<<<

 materials.
M ag azin e p a p e r
The magazine paper segment encompasses production and sale of the paper qualities super calendered (SC), machine finished coated (MFC), light weight coated (LWC) and NorCal. These paper qualities are for instance

<<<

 used in magazines, periodicals, catalogs and brochures.
E n e rg y
The energy segment includes purchase and sale of energy for the group's mills in Norway, sale of excess energy in the spot market and the fair value of certain energy contracts

<<<

 and em bedded derivatives in energy contracts. The sale of energy to the mills and in the spot market is reported as Operating revenue in the energy segment, while changes in fair value of energy contracts and em bedded derivatives are reported

<<<

 as Other gains and losses.
O th e r activities
Activities in the group that do not fall into any of the three operating segments are presented under other activities. This includes corporate functions, real estate activities, trading and sorting

<<<

 of recovered paper and purchase and resale of wood.
Revenues and expenses not allocated to operating segments Norske Skog manages non-current debt, taxes and cash positions on a group basis. Consequently, financial items and tax expenses are

<<<

 presented only for the group as a whole. The group's investment in associated companies accounted for in accordance with the equity method is primarily related to its 33.7% share in Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd., which is described

<<<

 in more detail in Note 20 Investments in associated companies.
M ajor custom ers Norske Skog had a total sales volume of newsprint and magazine paper of 3 857 000 tonnes in 2011, of which sales to the group's largest customer constituted approximately

<<<

 430 000 tonnes.

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES

<<<

 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
4. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQ UIPM ENT (Continued)
Norske Skog owns forests in Australia and Brazil. These assets are valued at fair value less estimated point-of

<<<

-sale costs. Changes in value are reported in the income statement line Other gains and losses. Machinery and equipment is depreciated over a period from ten to 25 years. Buildings and other property are depreciated over a period from ten to

<<<

 40 years. Fixtures and fittings are depreciated over a period from three to ten years. Land and plant under construction are not depreciated.
The difference between total additions and purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangible

<<<

 assets in the cash flow statement is due to capitalised allocated emission allowances, finance leases and accruals for payments. In 2011, acquisition costs of NOK 138 million and accumulated depreciation of NOK 65 million were reclassified

<<<

 from machinery to land and buildings. In 2010, NOK 140 million relating to a prior year reversal of dismantling provision was reclassified from land and buildings to machinery and equipment.
Non-current assets held for sale
In the second quarter

<<<

 of 2010, Norske Skog initiated a sales process for some of the group's non-production related properties in Norway. The assets had a carrying value of NOK 139 million at 31 Decem ber 2010 and were reclassified from Property, plant and equipment

<<<

 to Other current assets, in accordance with IFRS 5 N o n - c u r r e n t A s s e ts H e ld fo r S a le a n d D is c o n t in u e d O p e ra tio n s . The assets were classified as part of other activities in the segment reporting. The sale

<<<

 was completed in 2011. Norske Skog does not have any non-current assets held for sale per 31 Decem ber 2011.
Assumptions applied when calculating the recoverable amount
PPE and intangible non-current assets are written down to their recoverable

<<<

 amount when this is lower than the carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of future

<<<

 cash flows expected to arise from an asset or cash-generating unit. From the third quarter of 2011, Norske Skog started to use an adjusted present value model (APV) for calculating the present value of future cash flows. The reason for this

<<<

 is that the present value model (NPV) used previously is not very well suited to assess the value of assets in companies with poorer credit rating than B B B+ or A - 3 .
Nominal cash flow is estimated in the currency in which it will be generated

<<<

. In the adjusted present value model, the value is calculated by discounting based on a required rate of return on equity that is relevant for the cash-generating unit or the individual asset. The required rate of return is based on the interest

<<<

 rate on ten year government bonds in the currency of the cash flow estimate. This is adjusted for a specific operational risk relevant to Norske Skog, uncertainty in the estimated cash flow and, in certain instances, a country-specific risk

<<<

 premium relevant to the cash-generating unit or individual asset.
W hen calculating value in use at the end of 2011, the discount rate after tax was in the interval from 8.6% to 12.4% (7.7% to 10.8% in 2010, but then calculated as a weighted

<<<

 average cost of capital). The calculations are based on cash flow and the required rate of return after tax. Net present value of future cash flows after tax is adjusted for tax effects to arrive at the value in use when assessing impairment

<<<

.
W hen calculating value in use, the group is divided into the following cash-generating units: Europe newsprint, Europe magazine paper (light weight coated (LWC)), Australasia newsprint, South America newsprint, Norske Skog Saugbrugs magazine

<<<

 paper (super-calendered (SC)), Norske Skog Parenco magazine paper (NorCal), Norske Skog Follum magazine paper and Norske Skog Singburi newsprint. Norske Skog Parenco was part of the cash-generating unit Europe newsprint, up to and including

<<<

 the second quarter of 2011. In recent years, production at the mill has gradually been converted from newsprint to magazine paper. For 2011, the bulk of the production consists of magazine paper (NorCal). Since Norske Skog Parenco is the only

<<<

 mill in the group producing this magazine paper quality, it has been included as a separate cash-generating unit from the third quarter. In cases where several mills are part of a cash-generating unit, this is because production can be moved

<<<

 between the mills, based on what gives best profitability for the group as a whole.
F-242

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
4. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQ UIPM ENT (Continued

<<<

)
Cash flow is calculated individually for up to ten years for each cash-generating unit, based on the estimated useful life. The paper industry is a capital intensive industry where investment decisions are m ade based on projects with a long

<<<

 time horizon. The production machines have a long technical life. The estimated remaining useful life of the individual paper machines forms the basis for determining the length of the cash flow period. Sales prices and input prices are based

<<<

 on short-term forecasts in the first two years and on long-term forecasts for prices thereafter. The short-term forecasts are based on budgets from the mills, updated with the latest estimates for sales prices and prices for input factors.

<<<

 The expected value of operations beyond ten years is assessed as a terminal value based on industry average for the Enterprise Value / EBITDA, adjusted for the technical quality of the specific asset and the cash flow horizon. The rate of growth

<<<

 in the terminal value is zero.
The prognosis for long-term prices is an estimated equilibrium price level which the least cost-efficient mills in the industry need to survive an economic cycle. Only the capacity necessary to meet market requirements

<<<

 is included in the analysis. As for most industrial products, paper prices show a declining real price of approximately 1-2% per year. This means that the cash flow decreases gradually in the years where long-term prices are used.
Sensitivity

<<<

 to estimates of recoverable amount
The estimation of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include future changes in the prices for finished goods, sales volumes, prices for input

<<<

 factors (wood, recovered paper, energy, development in salaries, etc.), investment in fixed assets, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty when it comes to the outcome of the calculations. Norske

<<<

 Skog has conducted sensitivity analyses to assess how various changes in the assumptions made will impact the recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions m ade in the present value calculations, recoverable amount is most sensitive to

 changes in the prices of finished goods, sales volumes and currency movements. A reduction in sales prices (from 2013) and sales volume in the cash flow period of 5% would result in a reduction in the recoverable amount in the order of NOK

<<<

 5 400 million and NOK 1 900 million, respectively. Similarly, a weakening of USD of 5% would lead to a reduction in the recoverable amount of approximately NOK 800 million. A price increase of 5% on the input prices for wood, recovered paper

, energy and labour would reduce the recoverable amount by approximately NOK 800 million, NOK 600 million, NOK 500 million and NOK 700 million, respectively.

In te re s t rate sensitivity analysis
In accordance with

<<<

 IFRS 7 F in a n c ia l in s tru m e n ts -- d is c lo s u r e s , an interest rate sensitivity analysis is presented showing the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest costs and interest income, as well as equity where applicable

<<<

. The analysis is based on the following assumptions:
 Floating rate debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates, i.e. the interest costs or interest income associated with such instruments will fluctuate based on changes in market

<<<

 rates. These changes are accounted for in the sensitivity analysis. The result is based on the assumption that all other factors are kept constant.
 Changes in market rates on fixed rate debt will only affect the income statement if they are

<<<

 measured at their fair value. Thus, fixed rate instruments recognised at amortised cost will not represent an interest rate risk as defined by IFRS 7. Such instruments will therefore not have any influence on the sensitivity analysis.
 Change

<<<

 in fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedge on the group's fixed rate bonds will not influence the sensitivity calculation of either the income statement or equity. As a result of fair value hedge accounting

<<<

, the changes in fair value of interest rate swaps recognised in the income statement are, to a large extent, offset by opposite changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item. Potential ineffectiveness stemming from retrospective effectiveness

<<<

 testing of the hedging relationship is regarded as insignificant to this analysis.
 Changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives that are not designated as a fair value hedge of the group's liabilities, and which are subsequently measured

<<<

 at fair value through profit or loss, are taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis.
 Currency derivatives will only affect the sensitivity analysis to a very limited extent upon changes in the discount rate.
 Results are presented

<<<

 net of tax, using the Norwegian statutory tax rate of 28 per cent.
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on a parallel shift in the yield curve for each relevant currency to which Norske Skog is exposed. Following a 50 basis point

<<<

 downward/upward parallel shift in the yield curve in all interest rate markets to which Norske Skog is exposed, net earnings would have been NOK 2 million higher/lower at 31 Decem ber 2011 (NOK 2 million lower/higher at 31 Decem ber 2010).

<<<

 Change in net interest payments accounts for n Ok 3 million, and the total change in market values of derivatives carried at fair value through profit or loss accounts for NOK - 1 million. Floating rate debt has decreased in 2011 due to repayments

<<<

.
b) Currency risk
Transaction risk-- c a sh flo w h e d g e
The group has revenues and costs in various currencies. The major currencies are NOK, EUR, USD, GBP! AUD and NZD. Transaction risk arises because the group has a different currency

<<<

 split on income and expenses. Norske Skog calculates a 12-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling basis. The result of the hedging is included in Financial items in the income statement. Norske Skog does not use hedge

<<<

 accounting for the rolling cash flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a loss of NOK 13 million in 2011 (gain of NOK 58 million in 2010). Over time, currency losses or earnings are expected to offset increased or reduced future gross

<<<

 operating earnings.
Translation risk-- n e t in v e s tm e n t h e d g e
The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK. Currency translation risk arises when the financial statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies

<<<

, are translated into NOK. In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition to traditional

Norske Skog's net investment hedging is

 carried out in accordance with IAS 39. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity and offset by translation differences from assets in subsidiaries. The gain or loss related

 to the ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement. There was no ineffectiveness related to net investment hedge in 2011 and 2010. The effective portion recognised in equity was a gain of NOK 19 million in 2011 (gain

 of NOK 162 million in 2010). The portion of the debt portfolio to which hedge accounting does not apply, was somewhat smaller in 2011 than in 2010. The foreign exchange gains and losses from such liabilities are recognised in the income statement

F o reig n e x c h a n g e -- sensitivity analysis on fin a n c ia l instru m en ts
The following foreign exchange sensitivity analysis calculates the sensitivity of derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments on net profit

<<<

 and equity, based on a defined appreciation/ depreciation of NOK against relevant currencies, keeping all other variables constant. The analysis is based on several assumptions, including:
 Norske Skog as a group comprises entities with different

<<<

 functional currencies. Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments of a monetary nature, denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity, create foreign exchange rate exposure on the group's consolidated

<<<

 income statement. Moreover, foreign currency risk will also affect equity.
 Financial instruments denominated in the functional currency of the entity have no currency risk and will therefore not be applicable to this analysis. Furthermore

<<<

, the foreign currency exposure of translating financial accounts of subsidiaries into the group's presentational currency is not part of this analysis.
 Sensitivity on commodity contracts and em bedded derivatives is presented separately under

<<<

 ``Commodity risk''.
 Currency derivatives and foreign currency debt that are designated as net investment hedges and qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39 will only affect equity.
 Other currency derivatives that are recognised

<<<

 at fair value through profit and loss will affect the income statement. These effects come mainly from currency derivatives designated as hedging of the group's 12-month rolling cash flow exposure, and financial liabilities managed as economic

<<<

 net investment hedges which do not qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39.
 Other non-derivative financial instruments accounted for in the analysis comprise cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable and borrowings denominated

<<<

 in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity.
 Correlation effects between currencies are not taken into account. Figures are presented net of tax.

At 31 Decem ber 2011, if NOK had appreciated ten per cent against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would

<<<

 have been NOK 464 million higher (NOK 259 million higher at 31 Decem ber 2010). If NOK had depreciated by ten per cent at 31 Decem ber 2011 against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial

<<<

 instruments would have been NOK 503 million lower (n O k 361 million lower at 31 Decem ber 2010). Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner due to changes in the fair value of options. The effect of the sensitivity analysis on

<<<

 the income statement is mainly caused by changes in fair value of derivatives designated as rolling cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange gains/losses on the translation of EUR and USD denominated debt for which there is no hedge accounting

<<<

. Due to the fact that the portion of debt has increased in relation to the portion of cash, the effect on the income statement is larger in 2011 compared to 2010.
Given a ten per cent appreciation/depreciation of NOK, equity would have been

<<<

 NOK 378 million higher/ lower (NOK 560 million higher/lower at 31 Decem ber 2010) as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. The sensitivity on equity excludes the effects from

<<<

 the sensitivity on the income statement, calculated above.
c) Com m odity risk
A major part of Norske Skog's global commodity dem and is secured through long-term contracts. Norske Skog only uses financial instruments to a limited extent to

<<<

 hedge these contracts. The hedging ratio represents a trade-off between risk exposure and the opportunity to take advantage of short-term price drops in the spot market. Hedging levels are regulated through mandates approved by the board of

<<<

 directors.
Some of Norske Skog's purchase and sales contracts are defined as financial instruments, or contain em bedded derivatives, which fall within the scope of IAS 39. These financial instruments and em bedded derivatives are measured

<<<

 in the balance sheet at fair value with value changes recognised through profit or loss. Commodity contracts are either financial contracts for the purpose of trading or hedging, or physical commodity contracts that are not for the purpose

<<<

 of own use. The em bedded derivatives are common in physical commodity contracts and comprise a wide variety of derivative characteristics.
Changes in fair value of commodity contracts reflect unrealised gains or losses and are calculated as

<<<

 the difference between market price and contract price, discounted to present value. Some commodity contracts are bilateral contracts or em bedded derivatives in bilateral contracts, for which there exists no active market. Hence, valuation

<<<

 techniques, with the use of available market information, are used as much as possible. Techniques that reflect how the market could be expected to price instruments are used in non-observable markets.
Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts

<<<

 consists mostly of physical energy contracts. Fair value of commodity contracts is therefore especially sensitive to future changes in energy prices. The fair value of em bedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price

<<<

 index fluctuations.
In M ay 2011, Norske Skog sold the energy com pany Enerpar-Energias do Parana Ltda. in Brazil for NOK 410 million and in June 2010 Norske Skog sold excess electricity in Southern Norway from its long-term Norwegian electricity

 contract for NOK 800 million.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCO UNTING (Continued)
Credit risk
Norske Skog makes a credit evaluation of all financial trading counterparties. The credit risk evaluation is based on

<<<

 credit rating and C D S (Credit Default Swap). Based on the evaluation, a limit on credit exposure is established for each counterparty. These limits are monitored continuously in relation to unrealised profit on financial instruments and placements

<<<

. The maximum credit risk arising from financial instruments is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets in the balance sheet. This includes derivatives with positive market value except for em bedded derivatives. Em bedded derivatives

<<<

 are not subjected to credit risk, as there are no future cash flows associated with such derivatives.
Norske Skog's routines for credit managem ent of trade receivables and the authority to grant credit to customers are decentralised to the

<<<

 sales function. An integrated credit-assessment application is used to continuously monitor the development of overdue amounts.

9. DERIVATIVES Fair value of derivatives

The table below classifies financial instruments measured in the balance

<<<

 sheet at fair value, by valuation method. The different valuation methods are described as levels and are defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Inputs other

<<<

 than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability are not based on observable market

<<<

 data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

<<<

 contracts in level 3 are recognised in the income statement within Other gains and losses.

The fair value of derivatives that are not traded in an active market (over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using various valuation techniques

<<<

. Interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forward rate agreements and foreign currency forward contracts are all valued by estimating the present value of future cash flows. Currency options are valued using recognised option pricing models

<<<

. Quoted cash and swap rates are used as input for calculating zero coupon curves used for discounting. The exchange rates used are the quoted closing rates at 31 December.
The fair value of commodity contracts recognised in the balance sheet

<<<

 is calculated by using quotes from actively traded markets when available. Otherwise, price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used. Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 are recognised

<<<

 in the balance sheet and valued on the same principle as financial contracts. Some of these are long-term energy contracts. In calculating the fair value of em bedded derivatives, valuation techniques are used in the absence of observable market

<<<

 inputs. Em bedded currency options are calculated using a Black 76 valuation model, where some input assumptions have been made in absence of an active long-term option market.
The following table is presented in accordance with IFRS 7.27,

<<<

 showing the fair value of commodity contracts in level 3 given a change in assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative.

Total debt listed in the repayment schedule may differ from booked debt. This is due to premiums or discounts on issued bonds, hedge reserves and fair value hedging. At 31 Decem ber 2011, the accounts included a discount of NOK 91 million

<<<

 (discount of 51 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). Premiums or discounts on issued bonds are amortised in the income statement over the lifetime of the issued bonds. See Note 6 for loans secured by mortgage.

As a result of the termination of a

<<<

 large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the beginning of 2009, an amount was reclassified in the balance sheet. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 270 million is included in interest-bearing debt as at 31 Decem ber 

<<<

2011 (NOK 338 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the term of the debt that has been hedged.
Total interest-bearing debt

 is affected by unrealised currency effects on forward contracts and on cross currency swap contracts. This will also differ from booked debt. At 31 Decem ber 2011, this effect decreased debt by NOK 84 million (increased debt by NOK 236 million

<<<

 at 31 Decem ber 2010).

At 31 Decem ber 2011, the group's holding of its own bonds amounted to NOK 361 million of Norwegian bonds (NOK 334 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). The group's holding of own bonds in foreign currency amounted to USD

29 million and EUR 63 million, respectively (USD 125 million and EUR 7 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). This is deducted from interest-bearing debt in NOK.

LOAN COVENANTS
In the second quarter of 2011, the credit facility of EUR 400 million was

 repaid. In the same quarter, Norske Skog signed a new three-year credit facility of EUR 140 million and a Euro-denominated bond loan of EUR 150 million with a maturity of five years. The loan terms were later renegotiated.

LONG-TERM OW NERSHIP PLAN
The board adopted new principles for the long-term incentive programme in 2007, whereby the criteria for awarding synthetic shares to corporate managem

<<<

 ent is related to Total Shareholder Return (TSR-- development of the share price including dividend payments), such that this must be above average for a defined group of 16 listed paper manufacturers, including Norske Skog. A positive TSR

<<<

 for the period is also an absolute condition. This scheme will yield a 30% payout if Norske Skog performs better than the average for the reference group and a full payout if the com pany falls within the best quartile. The maximum annual payouts

<<<

 are 35 000 synthetic shares for the CEO and 17 500 for other members of corporate management, subject to a ceiling of 1.25 times the annual salary in the relevant year. At least 50% of the allocation (after tax) from this programme must be

<<<

 applied to purchasing shares, which must be retained until the total shareholding corresponds to a gross annual salary. Progress is measured over a three-year period, with a new period beginning each year. This scheme involves no dilution effect

<<<

.
The programme was continued for 2008 and 2009. It was also continued for 2010 with some changes: the maximum annual bonus from the programme was set to NOK 4 million for the CEO and NOK 2 million for other members of corporate managem ent

<<<

 (instead of a fixed number of shares), the bonus after tax must be used to purchase shares until the total shareholding in the company corresponds a certain number of shares (200 000 for the CEO and 100 000 for other members of corporate management

<<<

) and the number of companies in the defined reference group, including Norske Skog, was reduced to 12. The programme was continued for 2011, and it is proposed to continue with the programme for 2012.

The group has significant tax losses in several jurisdictions. These losses are included as a deferred tax asset to the extent it is expected

<<<

 that sufficient earnings will be earned within the time limitations applicable in the various jurisdictions. The table above summarises from which geographical areas the losses arose, as well as the portion of the losses that are not recognised

<<<

 as a deferred tax asset.

Deferred tax is not recognised on unrealised gains and losses on debt in foreign currency which is included in the group net investment. Total unrealised tax asset was NOK 217 million at 31 Decem ber 2011. The corresponding

<<<

 amount at 31 Decem ber 2010 was an unrealised tax liability of NOK 72 million.

20. INVESTM ENTS IN ASSOCIATED COM PANIES (Continued)
Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd. (MNI)
The com pany is incorporated in

<<<

 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and is a producer of newsprint. The possibility to reverse previously-recognised impairments in associated companies was assessed at 31 Decem ber 2011. The impairment assessment for MNI concluded that there was basis

<<<

 for reversal of impairments recognised previously, amounting to NOK 204 million. The carrying value of Norske Skog's investment in MNI was NOK 394 million as at 31 Decem ber 2011, which is equivalent to Norske Skog's share (33.7%) of the equity

<<<

 in M N I's com pany financial statements. Based on the com pany's financial statements, operating revenue in 2011 was NOK 1 015 million (NOK 949 million in 2010) and net profit was NOK 16 million (NOK - 1 4 million in 2010). Total assets amounted

<<<

 to NOK 2 314 million at 31 Decem ber 2011 (n O k 2 399 million at 31 Decem ber 2010) and total liabilities were NOK 1 143 million (NOK 1 240 million at 31 Decem ber 2010).

 sheet as current liabilities. In the fourth quarter of 2011, it was decided to shut down the paper production at Norske Skog Follum. Total provisions related to the closure were NOK 248 million at 31 Decem ber 2011, of which NOK 131 million

<<<

 related to severance payments and NOK 117 million was other expected costs related to the shut down of the operations and clearing of the site. Another material item was a provision of NOK 59 million related to a cost reduction programme at

<<<

 Norske Skog Walsum. For further information see Note 16 Restructuring expenses.

Dism antling provision
Provisions related to future dismantling costs arising from a future closing down of production facilities amounted to NOK 102 million at

<<<

 31 Decem ber 2011, compared to NOK 92 million at 31 Decem ber 2010. The total amount is classified as non-current and will only be realised at the time of a future closing down of any of the Norske Skog production units. The provision is the

<<<

 net present value of the future estimated costs, calculated using a long-term risk-free interest rate. The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement under Financial items. The opposite entry for dismantling provision

<<<

 and change in provision estimates is Property, plant and equipment.
Discount rates and assumptions included as part of the best estimate will impact the future carrying value of the dismantling provision. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction

<<<

 in the future discount rate of one percent point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 10 million, with a corresponding increase in future depreciation on property, plant and equipment.

21. PROVISIONS (Continued)
Environmental provision
The group's provision for environmental obligations is presented in the balance sheet as Other non-current liabilities. The provision is related to estimated

<<<

 future costs for cleaning up any environmental pollution caused by Norske Skog production units. The provision will mainly be realised in a future period upon a potential shut down of the production activities of any of the Norske Skog production

<<<

 units. Increased environmental requirements from local governments may also lead to realisation of this provision at an earlier point in time.
Provisions for future environmental obligations amounted to NOK 283 million as at 31 Decem ber 2

<<<

011 compared to NOK 254 as at 31 Decem ber 2010. The movement is mainly a result of significantly lower discount rates.
The carrying value of the provision is the best estimate made by measuring the expected value of the specific obligations

<<<

, discounted to present value using a long-term risk-free interest rate when the time value of money is material. Changes in factors included in the expected value will impact the carrying value of the obligation. To illustrate the sensitivity

<<<

, a reduction in the future discount rate by one percentage point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 27 million. Changes in accounting estimates not related to assets are classified as operating items in the income statement,

<<<

 and the periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised within Financial items.

NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
25. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT Norske Skog's objective when managing capital is to maximise

<<<

 return on equity within the limits set by the group's external debt financing. In order to improve the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or

<<<

 sell assets to reduce debt. The group monitors its capital structure on the basis of interest coverage ratio (EBITDA / net interest expense) and the debt ratio (net interest-bearing debt / EBITDA). The group was within the limits for the key

<<<

 figures as at 31 Decem ber 2011. For more information see Note 11. The strategy for managing capital was changed in 2011, as a result of new loan covenants. Previously, the capital managem ent was monitored on the basis of gearing, which was

<<<

 calculated as net interest bearing debt divided by equity.
26. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Norske Skog is an international com pany that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and

<<<

 contracting parties. At the end of 2011, the group is in dialogues with tax authorities in Norway and Australia regarding previously completed transactions. The ongoing simplification of the group's corporate structure, and changes individual

<<<

 countries' tax laws, could increase the group's tax exposure. The group's assessment is that sufficient provisions have been made for the aforementioned conditions.
27. RELATED PARTIES All transactions with related parties are conducted in

<<<

 accordance with the arm 's length principle. Some of Norske Skogindustrier ASA's shareholders are forest owners delivering forestry products to the group's production units in Norway. A former board member, Halvor Bjrken, is a forest owner

<<<

 who supplies wood to the group on normal standardised terms. Bjrken left the board of directors during 2011. All contracts for supply of wood are entered into through forest owner associations or companies. The associated com pany Malaysian

<<<

 Newsprint Industries Sdn. Bhd. purchases recovered paper from Reparco companies in the Norske Skog group. The value of total purchases made during 2011 amounted to NOK 5 million (NOK 20 million in 2010), and total amounts payable to the Norske

<<<

 Skog group amounted to NOK 0 million as at 31 D ecem ber 2011 (NOK 3 million as at 31 Decem ber 2010). One of the board members, Alexandra Bech Gjrv, becam e a partner in the law firm Hjort DA in 2010. Norske Skogindustrier ASA purchased services

<<<

 amounting to NOK 345 000 from this firm during 2011 (NOK 148 000 during 2010). None of the board members receive remuneration for their work for the com pany from any source other than the com pany itself.
28. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET

<<<

<<<

 of 400 GWh per year until the end of 2018.
