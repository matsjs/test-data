<<<

 applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors); or
(ii) the Issuer merges with any other Person, or is subject to a demerger, with the effect that the Issuer is not the surviving entity;
(g) any expropriation, attachment, sequestration

and (c) or, regarding any Material Group Company, on the grounds mentioned in

Clauses 11.1 (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) may

<<<

 only occur if the nature of the particular

circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of

termination is continuing at the time of the Trustee's declaration. However, if a

moratorium occurs, the ending

<<<

 of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment

prematurely on the ground mentioned in Clause 11.1 (d).

11.3

If the right to terminate the Certificates is based upon a decision of a court of law or a

government authority, it

<<<

 is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under

law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed

to exist.

11.4

The Issuer is obliged to inform the Trustee immediately if any circumstance

<<<

 of the type

specified in Clause 11.1 should occur. Should the Trustee not receive such information, the

Trustee is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur,

provided that the Trustee does not have knowledge

<<<

 of such circumstance. The Trustee is

under no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in

Clause 11.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Trustee, provide the Trustee with

details of any

<<<

 circumstances referred to in Clause 11.1 and provide the Trustee with all

documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 11.

11.5

The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Trustee according to Clause 11.4 if informing

<<<

 the

Trustee would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with OMX.

If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with OMX or otherwise, the

Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the

<<<

 approval from OMX or undertake other

reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Trustee,

in order to be able to timely inform the Trustee according to Clause 11.4.

11.6

If the Trustee has been notified

<<<

 by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a

default under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 11.1, the Trustee shall

decide, within 10 Banking Days of the day of notification or determination, if the

Certificates

<<<

 shall be declared terminated. If the Trustee has decided not to terminate the

Certificates, the Trustee shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that there

exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders

<<<

 according to the

provisions in Clause 13 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of

termination and instruct the Trustee to terminate the Certificates, the Trustee shall

promptly declare the Certificates terminated. However

<<<

, if the cause for termination

according to the Trustee's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Trustee shall not

terminate the Certificates. The Trustee shall in such case, at the earliest possible date,

notify the Holders that

<<<

 the cause for termination has ceased. The Trustee shall always be

11.7
11.8 11.9 11.10 12. 12.1

entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default and whether such event has a Material

<<<

 Adverse Effect.
If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Trustee or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 13 (Decisions by Holders), the Trustee shall promptly declare the

<<<

 Certificates terminated. The Trustee is however not liable to take action if the Trustee considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Trustee harmless from any

<<<

 loss or liability and, if requested by the Trustee in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Certificates are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 11, the Trustee shall take

<<<

 every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Certificates.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Certificates cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 11 without relevant

<<<

 decision by the Trustee or following instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 13 (Decisions by Holders).
If the Certificates are declared due and payable, the Issuer shall redeem the Certificates at a redemption amount equal to 10

<<<

0.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with the Applicable Premium.
DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
All payments by the Issuer relating to the Certificates and any proceeds originating from the enforcement of the Account Pledge Agreement and

<<<

 the Undertaking following a termination of the Certificates in accordance with Clause 11 (Termination o f the Certificates) shall be distributed in the following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Trustee:
(a) first

<<<

, in or towards payment pro rata of (i) all unpaid fees, costs, expenses and indemnities payable by the Issuer to the Trustee, (ii) other costs, expenses and indemnities relating to the termination of the Certificates, the enforcement of the

<<<

 Account Pledge Agreement or the Undertaking or the protection of the Holders' rights, (iii) any costs incurred by the Trustee for external experts that have not been reimbursed by the Issuer in accordance with Clause 17.2.6, and (iv) any costs

<<<

 and expenses incurred by the Trustee in relation to a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure that have not been reimbursed by the Issuer in accordance with Clause 13.14;
(b) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of the Applicable Premium

<<<

;
(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Certificates; and
(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under these Terms and Conditions or relating to the

<<<

 Account Pledge Agreement or the Undertaking.

Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to 

<<<

(d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.

12.2

If a Holder or another party

<<<

 has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 12.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a

corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 12.1.

12.3

Funds that the Trustee

<<<

 receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the termination

of the Certificates and/or enforcement of any security created under the Finance

Documents constitute escrow funds (Sw. redovisningsmedel) and must be held on a

separate

<<<

 interest-bearing account on behalf of the Holders and the other interested parties.

The Trustee shall arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with this Clause 12 as

soon as reasonably practicable.

12.4

If the Issuer or the Trustee

<<<

 shall make any payment under this Clause 12, the Issuer or the

Trustee, as applicable, shall notify the Holders of any such payment at least 15 Banking

<<<



date and the amount to be paid.

 such funding or indemnities (or adequate security has been provided therefore) as it may reasonably require.
The Trustee shall give a notice to the Holders (i) before it ceases to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents by reason

 related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents to be paid by the Trustee to the Holders, provided that the Trustee has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply

 in accordance with Clause 17.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity
