<<<

 to make payments in relation to the Notes and to comply with these Terms and Conditions, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be

 subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such agreement. Furthermore, upon registration of the Notes in the CSD, the Noteholders shall be bound by these Terms and Conditions and any other

<<<

 Finance Document without any further action or formality being required to be taken or satisfied.
The nominal amount of each Note is SEK 500,000 (the "Nominal Amount") (as amended from time to time). The aggregate nominal amount of the Notes

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law.
The Notes are freely transferable but the Noteholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Notes, as applicable, under
