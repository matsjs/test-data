<<<

 it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, to waive such Event of Default (temporarily or permanently). However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent

 termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under Clause 14.1(d) (Insolvency).
14.3 If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision

<<<

, however, not restrict a Bondholders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
If a Bondholder or another party has paid any

<<<

 fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in Clause 14.1, such Bondholder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 15.1.
